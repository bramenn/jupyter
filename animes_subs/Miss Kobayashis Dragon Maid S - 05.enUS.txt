Oborozuka Shopping District
Would you stop snarling at each other every time you meet?
It's her fault for glaring at me!
What?! Fried tofu fritters are delicious!
I guess there's no stopping it when you tried to kill each other the moment you met.
Huh?
No, we didn't try to kill each other at first.
That's right.
We didn't start that when we first met.
What was your first meeting like, then?
I heard there might be a civil war soon.
Looks like it.
The royal succession dispute is finally coming to a head.
At this rate the neighboring country's going to capitalize on it.
Hmm, humans are so foolish.
Every time they open their mouths, it's about some conflict.
That's mine!
I found it first!
Do they have no intention of enjoying their worthless lives?
She's here!
It's the priestess of the holy seas!
Priestess?
She's come to our town, too!
Yes, now we're saved!
Priestess of the holy seas?
I've heard of her.
Lately she's been intervening in human conflicts and resolving them.
If the conflict is over water or food,
she creates lakes and causes abundant harvests.
If they clash, she makes them lose their will to fight with her miraculous power.
She must be a god or something on par with them...
Either way, it's against the rules for them to interfere in human society.
Well, let's see what she's like.
That woman!
She's neither god nor divine messenger!
Is she?
But if that's the case, is she just fooling around?!
What do you think you're doing?
A dragon acting as a miraculous priestess?
You make me laugh.
I could ask you the same thing.
What is the Emperor of Demise's daughter doing in a human village?
Your name is Tohru, if I remember right?
I just believe that humans shouldn't fight each other,
and it's foolish to spill unnecessary blood.
I have the power to stop that, so I do.
So you're actually doing work, unlike the other lazy harmony dragons.
I bet you've had quite a few human sacrifices offered to you.
I don't need any human sacrifices.
What? Why not?
Why would anyone say humans are tasty to eat?
I'm sure there are much tastier things in this world.
It's my belief that humans will create them.
I see.
She's the oddball Quetzalcoatl mentioned.
Are you Elma, then?
So what, you ask for food in return?
You sure you aren't better suited to the chaos faction?
You sound like a bit of an oddball yourself.
None of the chaos dragons I've met thus far were willing to engage in conversation.
I just slotted the act of judging you in before destroying you.
Judging me, huh?
Would you like to accompany me for a while, then?
What?
Let's both judge the world of humans together.
So you two traveled together for a while?
Yes, well...
I went along with her self-righteousness for a bit.
I must have been crazy at the time.
So you were both feeling each other out, then?
Going around without pushing too hard as two people with different value sets.
I guess you could say that?
I was more interested in Elma
than the goals of our species, since she was doing as she pleased.
At least, I think that's how it was at the time.
Mhmm. So then what?
It's simple.
We came to understand one another, so...
We couldn't see eye to eye, so after a few decades naturally we...
tried to kill each other.
That's not natural at all.
Why?!
Why did you destroy the palace?!
This was supposed to be a symbol of peace!
Peace, huh?
The thought of a peace requiring you gave me the chills.
What?!
This palace was erected to worship you as a god.
From it, a religion centered around you took root
and adopted a class-based society full of disparity.
In time there would come to be conflict with those who refused to accept you.
I would have forbidden that!
You're not listening to what I'm trying to say.
Did you intend to remain here with these humans for all eternity?
Granting the desires of others and acting as a symbol of worship forever?
I'm asking you if you wanted to let yourself get dragged into those humans' framework
when you thought were operating under your own.
You've diverged from your original intentions, Elma!
I'm disappointed in you!
I can't stand how disgraceful you've become.
So I'll kill you and wake those humans from their dream.
Now you've said it!
Try to kill me, if you can!
I knew it, too, you know.
This wasn't going in a good direction.
But what else could I do?
The food they brought me was just so delicious!
She's...!
She's...!
Strong!
That was how we conclusively broke apart.
That sounds both grand and petty.
In the end, I returned to the harmony faction's base
and didn't get involved with humans again.
So you two got along so well, you could fight.
Miss Kobayashi, did you listen to any of our story just now?
She's right, Miss Kobayashi!
We're completely at odds with each other!
Really?
Tohru's been docile here,
and you have your hands too full with work to try to lead humanity.
Wouldn't that mean you have no reason to fight here?
Miss Kobayashi?
Do you not understand why things are like that here?
Huh?
Because the food here's delicious!
Both Tohru and I are gluttons!
I really won't ever get along with you!
What's that?!
You're always easily enticed by food!
But tasting human culture is the best way to understand humans!
You just want to stuff your face!
You're totally hooked on human food yourself!
They're so close they understand each other's inner thoughts,
Day after day, you're cooking food!
Never tiring of it, always in your maid outfit!
You're always in your office attire, even on your days off, too!
and they fight to shave away the parts they can't accept.
Don't act like that's the same as your unnatural appearance!
This is natural for me!
I always wanted friends like that myself.
How is that natural?!

Potato Chips
Maid in Love
I'll kill you.
Huh?!
Day after day you laze about!
Why don't you go work a bit?!
I've been thinking about my future.
Just give me another century.
Don't think about it on a dragon's scale!
I'll help you with your work for now, then.
What?!
There's no way you could handle the work of a maid!
Please don't underestimate maids!
That's what Kobayashi is always saying to you.
Though... Work, huh?
Kobayashi does that, right?
That's right.
She's earning money for your food costs, too.
All right, I'll work.
At the same place as Kobayashi, then.
I'll erase you!
What? You're scaring me.
I'll erase Elma, too!
Why are you bringing Elma up?
Achoo!
Would you like to search for a place that'll employ you, then?
Using our PC or reading the classifieds?
No, I'll look and decide for myself.
Hmph.

It's forbidden to do all those things here, though.
Right...
I hate those kinds of instinctual things.
Well, we're here because we denied them.
You can do that?
Of course!
That means there's nowhere you can work, though.
Hey! Let's play!
Sure, let's play!
Want to go together?
Go where?
Shopping!
Let's go!
Over there!
Yeah!
Oboro Shop
Candy Games
Close.
Yoohoo! Kanna-chan, Saikawa-san!
Oh, you're here.
Lady Tohru, Ilulu.
Huh? What brings you here?
That's my question. Why are you here?
This is our hangout.
Oboro Shop
So these ladies are friends of yours, Kanna-chan?
I'm Tohru.
This is Ilulu.
We were searching for a part-time job, but...
Which should we get?
They all taste the same.
All right!
Kanna-chan, this would look good on you.
You, too, Saikawa-san.
We match.
I haven't seen you before.
Are you the maid's little sister?
So this is your shop, Ms. Aida?
Ilulu, this is Ms. Aida.
We've met often at the neighborhood association meetings.
Oh, what happened to your leg?
Oh, I messed it up while jogging.
I'm getting old now, so I've been thinking of closing up shop.
No way!
But as you can see, I just can't.
There are a lot of kids here.
That's because we're a candy shop.
Different children have been coming here for decades now.
Could I work here?!
How old are you?
She's the same age as me.
The same as you?
Hmm, what should I do?
I was thinking of letting my grandson run the shop,
but I guess it would be better to have someone
enthusiastic about it than someone reluctant to do it.
I would ask you to let her, as well.
Okay!
Huh.
Working part time at a candy store, huh?
It's Oboro Shop.
Do you know about it, Kobayashi?
It's at the end of the shopping district, right?
She got hired thanks to my voice of authority.
She displayed firm command of her emotions,
and I thought she was terrifying.
Praise me more.
Is that really praise?
Will it all be okay?
Worried?
You chose it because you were interested in it, right?
I started my job with vague feelings and found things that made it fulfilling, too.
So I think that's a fine way to start work.
I see.
I'm a maid because I was interested in it, too, and it's very fulfilling!
So pet me!
Ilulu.
Make sure you listen to others and learn your tasks properly.
Don't let yourself be like this maid.
M-Miss Kobayashi!
Hmph.
What's wrong, Take?
My grandma hurt her leg.
So you're stuck helping out?
No. Apparently she hired someone, so she just asked me to support them to start.
Aida Taketo
Huh. That stubborn old woman hired someone outside the family.
I'm taking a uniform over today,
but get a look at this.
It's sized for an adult man.
So she hired a guy?
I have no idea where she met him.
If he's some weirdo, I'm chasing him out.
So cool, Taketo-kun.
Shut up.
Oboro Shop
Candy Games
Jeez.
What the heck are they like?
A-Adult size!
Crazy!
Aida's grandson?
I'm Aida Taketo.
I'm Ilulu. I'm 16.
That's what we're telling people.
The same age?
Going by the name... you're a foreigner?
How'd you meet Grandma?
I met her here,
asked her to let me work, and she hired me.
That was decided way too easily.
This is suspicious.
She has to have some ulterior motive for suddenly wanting to work here like this.
So, what are you here for?
Oh, yeah, your uniform.
An apron and a white shirt.
Stuff to wear?
Got it.
Pfft!
Hey! A pervert?! Are you a pervert?!
Oh, right.
Shame.
I forgot.
Naughty boy.
Don't act ashamed while rolling up your shirt!
Go change in back! In back!
Oh, that's how it is.
What was that?
Does she come from a country with that kind of culture?
I want to go there!
Hey, Taketo?
Just Take's fine.
What's wrong?
I can't get the buttons on this closed.
Y-You'll be fine like that.
Okay, then.
You're a pervert, aren't you?
Huh?! What are you saying?!
You're staring.
I-I'm not staring!
I'll be back here, so ask if there's anything you don't understand.
She's a weirdo in a different way!
I'm surprised Grandma decided to hire such a mysterious person.
She makes way less sense than someone with ulterior motives and it's scary.
Can she even do the work?
This please.
Sure thing.
Give me that one.
This one?
Yeah.
Water Balloons
Do we sell these individually?
Yeah, that's right.
Lucky
She's actually trying to do an honest job.
Yay!
Wait. Even more so than I would, huh?
Is that why Grandma hired her?
Wow! Why do you have such big breasts?
Whoa! An elementary schooler's blazing fastball of innocent sexual harassment!
How will you divert it?
These are my flame sacs. They're big so they can hold fire.
I see.
What kind of nonsense deflection is that?!
Are they heavy?
Do they make your shoulders stiff?
Hmm, would you like to hold them?
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Hey, don't do anything weird!
Are you okay, Take?
S-S-Sorry!
Oh, right.
Naughty boy.
Why's your reaction so delayed?!
Oboro Shop
Candy Games
Bye-bye!
Goodbye!
Later!
You know,
I like kids.
I like playing with them.
But I can't play while I'm working.
So I wanted to work somewhere where children have fun.
It's time to close up shop.
Yeah.
Want to play for a bit?
I'll show you how to spin the top.
Oh, that thing!
Teach me! Teach me!
I'll bring it over!
She's a nice girl.
Looks like I won't have to worry about Grandma.
Take, I like you.
What? That's my line.
Second to Kobayashi.
Who's Kobayashi?
Oboro Shop
Candy Games
I brought it.
Watch closely.
Did you know?
Apparently humans make wishes on stars.
Huh?
Apparently they pray to stars for peace,
bountiful harvests, and happiness for themselves and their families.
So they don't care who grants their wishes, as long as they're granted?
What an utterly inferior species.
What would you wish for?
If your wish could come true.
Nothing, really.
As for me...
You'd probably just wish for lots of delicious food to eat, right?
You know me well, don't you?
But that's not all.
What then?
I'd wish for your share of delicious food, too.
Have it your way.

Don't you agree, Miss Kobayashi?!

Lately there's five places I want to visit for lunch,
but I can only hit two of them!
Normal people wouldn't go to multiple places!
