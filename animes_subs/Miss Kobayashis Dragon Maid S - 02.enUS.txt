Ilulu.
Ilulu.
Were you playing with humans again?
Yeah.
Humans are nice, so I love them!
I see.
Perhaps it is time we consider coexisting, then.
Bad news!
The humans are attacking the dragon village!
This always happens when we stay quiet.
Damn humans!
They will pay!
Where's Mom and Dad?
I'm sorry, dear.
Does this mean I can't play with humans anymore?
Of course it does!
The humans are the ones who took your parents from you!
Humans are our enemy!
There will never be understanding between us!
Good.
Everyone's asleep.
I can't believe the first one I'd see aside from my father's would be my own...
Jeez, please say something if you're going to be late.
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
What's the matter, Miss Kobayashi?
Your face is bright red.
Huh?
Do you have a cold?
I-I'm fine!
Huh? Why?!
Why is my heart racing because Tohru looks like this?!
Does this mean I'm lusting after Tohru?
Just put your clothes on.
Okay.
Kobayashi,
now that you've become a man,
you'll show your true colors in no time!
Now, show me!
Show me how shallow humans are!
I bet that's what she's thinking.
I'm betting Ilulu used magic to turn me into a guy.
I just hope I go back to normal with time.
I don't know what Ilulu hopes to get out of me,
but I need to keep a clear head.
K-Kanna-chan?!
Good morning, Kobayashi.
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be cold in the morning.
I-I'm awake already, okay?
At this point, I have no idea what might happen.
I'll need to keep some distance from the others.
I wonder if Tohru could fix this.
Huh?! Miss Kobayashi's become a male?!
Let's do it, then!
Let's get on with preserving our species!
That's dangerous.
Okay, let's ride the canoe to adventure!
What are you watching?
Everyone watching at home come along with us, too!
Clinky Clang.
Oh!
Are you all ready?
Let's go!
Go!
Oh!
Oh?
Now, paddle, paddle!
Yeah!
It's a waterfall! Everyone, huddle up!
This is normal between women.
I-I can take it.
I won't be controlled by some crazy instincts.
Miss Kobayashi!
Don't hug me for no reason!
Kobayashi!
Don't frolic on me!
Miss Kobayashi!
I said, don't hug me for no reason!
Miss Kobayashi!
No!
Was her contact always this intense?
Phew.
Thank goodness, it's gotten smaller.
I knew Ilulu had to be weakened after her battle with Tohru.
The factions of dragons from Tohru's world...
The chaos faction, right?
They hate humans and teach their children the same.
Ilulu was raised that way,
so she lives that way
and thinks like that, too.
Miss Kobayashi! Miss Kobayashi!
Kanna's asleep, so how about some evening liquor?
Mmm.
It's good.
I'm done thinking about it today.
Huh? This happened before, too.
The love potion?!
I noticed partway through.
Right now, you...
have one of those!
Ilulu must have gotten to you, huh?
Poor Miss Kobayashi.
I'll fix you right up.
But before that!
I'll seize my opportunity!
Now that our hearts are united, that just leaves our bodies.
Now, Miss Kobayashi, give it all to me.
Why are you completely turned off?!
You took off your maid outfit.
How could you?
Huh?
Tohru, I'm going to tell you all the things that make a maid great
from the male perspective.
Good.
I made it through that.
What will you do next, Ilulu?
It's displayed nicely, Miss.
Something's not right, though.
That does it!
I see!
Episode 2
Hot Guy Kobayashi! (In Many Senses)
Stop. Don't run.
You followed me here, harmony bastard?!
I'm Cremene of the dragon-slaying camp.
Give my name to the judge in the underworld after you die.
I want the credit.
Now...
Ilulu always appears when I'm alone,
so maybe I can see her if I wait here?
I wonder why I'm
focusing on Ilulu so much?
Maybe it's because I feel like we could get along?
All the others I've met from another world
have been friendly.
They all have this air of having lived through conflict and its resulting tragedy,
yet they're still able to interact with people
because they know that's not everything.
Because they're willing to believe there's more than just strife.
That's the Tohru I believe in.
Which is why I want her to reconcile
with Ilulu.
Ilulu's not showing up.
Maybe she's over here, where there's less foot traffic?
Ilulu?!
You're injured?
You've seen us?
Human of this world, I have come to destroy that vile beast from another world.
Leave here at once,
and forget you were ever here.
Who is this guy?
Do you mean you're here to kill Ilulu?
You're saying you're an adult that's trying to kill a child?
I am.
That creature is chaos.
An evil dragon that will bring naught but harm to humans.
In that case...
What is that unpleasant blare?!
Hey! Keep it down!
All right!
Security Buzzer Power!
You're damn heavy!
They ran away?
Why would a human...?
Oh, coming to?
You okay?
It looks like your wound healed up right away, though.
Why did you save me?
Can we say we're safe yet?
I'm sure that guy's still after you, right?
It doesn't matter.
Huh?
If I'm defeated in battle, then that's just my fate.
Wouldn't me saving you be fate, too, then?
Hey, Ilulu.
Is there something you want to tell me?
The way you mess with me
kind of suggests there is.
can't accept dragons coexisting with humans.
There's no way they can get along with humans.
You told me that before.
Because if they can get along...
then why did I spend all this time...
Dragons are superior beings, so associating with humans is shameful.
I really...
There were all kinds of tragedies.
Harmony is impossible.
I really, well...
Humans are our enemy!
I wanted...
I wanted to...
I really...
wanted to play with them more!
No one would let me.
That girl and that boy did nothing wrong, and yet...
I see.
Then, hey,
let's play together next time.
We do all kinds of things, you know.
We play dodgeball, go to Comiket, go to hot springs, and so on.
Though, you'll have to lay off the kind of play that turns into battles.
Y-You're trying to trick me!
You're trying to win me over by saying nice things!
Yeah, I am.
Huh?
I'm trying to tame a fierce, evil dragon of chaos
with sweet words to render her harmless.
Will you believe what you've been taught?
Or would you care to be tricked by me?
That's enough.
I can't believe you and the human were working together.
I'll exterminate you, too!
Can you do that?
You have rules to follow, don't you?
Those rules are only on paper.
They're rules between dragons, so they don't apply to humans.
He's making Tohru's father seem genuinely nice.
But...
Don't underestimate humans.
A human who would try to protect a dragon?
Hmph!
Kobayashi!
Ow!
That super hurts.
You're late.
You?!
How are you here?!
How dare you hurt Miss Kobayashi!
E-Even if you're here, I just need to call in reinforcements!
I'll summon Lady Elma at on
Choose the right words to plead for your life
and I'll let you have your soul back after breaking your body.
Now,
beg for your life!
D-Did you kill him?
No, I just erased his memories of this world
and sent him back from where he came.
After punishing him a bit.
Horn
I see.
Thank goodness.
Now Ilulu can...
Huh? Now that I'm relieved, I feel...
Miss Kobayashi?!
Please hang in there!
Dragon saliva can stop bleeding!
You just want to lick her, don't you?!
Here I come, Miss Kobayashi! Lick, lick, lick, lick!
Man, your tongue is long!
A functional member of society
is someone who diligently obeys the rules
and prioritizes their company over their private life.
I believed that's just how it is.
Because I was taught that it's my duty to fill my role as a functional member of society.
Then, the next thing I knew, I no longer had any friends in my private life.
That was when I met Tohru and managed to change.
So, maybe,
I was seeing my old self in Ilulu.
Ah.
Miss Kobayashi?
Stay with me!
You're okay.
Tohru.
Kanna-chan.
Is this our home?
Yes!
I healed your wounds, as well!
Where's Ilulu?
Right there.
This girl wouldn't even try to leave your side.
Even if she's finally noticed what makes you so great, it's too late!
Kobayashi!
Can I let you trick me?
Yeah, of course.
Good morning.
El NiNo Miki is here to share today's national weather.
Today, large regions will be seeing sunshine.
Will she be fine without making her claws and tail disappear?
We're under a high pressure system, so it's calm skies over a wide region.
And if she could make her breasts a normal size.
You can rest assured and hang your laundry out today.
Ilulu is already pushing herself as it is at that size.
The cherry blossoms are starting to bloom as well.
If she wasn't pushing herself, her breasts would be even bigger.
They're only just blooming, but there aren't many caterpillars at this time!
Oh, she could probably make her claws and tail disappear if she tried.
So, how about giving an early flower viewing a try right now?
Huh? What do you mean she can't reduce her breasts?
Give me about 5 of that!
Mornings and evenings will be chilly in many locations.
Kobayashi, Kobayashi.
What's the matter?
This is where excrement goes, right?
How does it work?
I have to start from there?
Yeah, you sit on there.
Just like that.
I got it.
We'll have to teach her all kinds of things.
If only I had a talented maid at times like these.
I'd see them in a whole new light.
Sorry. Just while I'm away at work.
It's fine.
You and I have a special, eternal bond, after all!
Don't add eternal on there so casually.
Have a good day.
Have you been working those muscles?
Now...
When you don't work out they'll degrade and it can hasten your body's aging.
We were just trying to kill each other the other day.
There's no way Tohru would forgive a traitor.
She'll eliminate me.
But I want to know more about Kobayashi before that.
I won't go down easily.
Don't fight!
Here.
Living as a Human Manual
Kobayashi Tohru
It's the manual I wrote on how to live as a human.
Now, change your claws into human hands.
Wha?
Why are you laughing at yourself?!
Do you suck at making hands?
I can't transform them well.
I'll read it like this.
Oh, you can hold it with those hands?
They come with tiny hands.
Creepy!
Greetings.
Humans establish communication with greetings.
For now just repeat whatever greeting one says to you.
Food.
Humans can mostly eat anything, but they stubbornly won't eat dragon meat.
Currently seeking ways to get them to eat it.
Mating
I want to do it.
The stuff in here is biased!
It's the truth for me.
Clothing.
Wearing clothing as similar as possible to what other humans wear will keep you from standing out.
Hmm?
Aren't you going against this a bit?
Conspicuous
Yah!
Fine.
I'll wear human clothing, too.
We don't have your size.
There are Kanna's clothes, right?
The size won't fit!
See, it fit.
What did I just tell you?
Why don't you transform your scales like I do?
I don't have the skill to do that.
I'll lend you my clothes, then.
What are you planning to do from now on?
What will I do?
What do you want to do?
There's something, isn't there?
Something I want to do?
I'll think on it.
That so?
Yeah.
You couldn't fully say that polite phrase there.
This might come as a surprise,
but I don't take kindly to you being here!
That's not a surprise.
After all, think about how you showed up!
You were like a bloodthirsty berserker.
No, that was because fighting you seemed like fun.
Wait, I looked like that?!
Please figure out what you want to do quickly.
They say those who don't work don't eat.
What about Kanna?
Kanna has her job as an elementary school student.
Then I'll be an elementary school student, too.
You have to be a child for that.
You're about the same age as me, aren't you?
I see.
At least think it over.
I'm home.
What's Ilulu doing?
Thinking about what she wants to do.
Hmm...
I hope you find something.
What is it?
I figured out what I want to do for now.
Oh, what's that?
I want to make babies with you.
Huh?
Huh?
When I thought about it,
I am at an age where I could have and raise children.
I want you to fill the loneliness from my lack of family.
Kobayashi, have sex with me!
No way!
That's just no, no, no, no!
Not happening!
I'm a woman, anyway.
I can give you a thing again!
No, you won't!
If you do that, then I'm doing her!
Vulgar.
Right?
Absolutely not, got it?!
I'm not really holding onto my chastity for a reason, but I'm not giving it to you all.
Oh!
That's for Ilulu.

Where should we have Ilulu sleep?
We don't have space for another bed.
What about here?
The closet?
It's calming.
If you're okay with it, that works.
Yeah, I like it.
