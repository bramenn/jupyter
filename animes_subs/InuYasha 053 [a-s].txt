You pesky moth!
I don't remember a thing while I was transformed.
Tetsusaiga suppresses the demon blood that flows through him.
Tetsusaiga is merely a dog's fang.
At that moment, Tetsusaiga was broken...
awakening the demon blood inside Inuyasha.
Once awakened, the demon blood will try to protect itself and retransform.
That's why you must not let go of Tetsusaiga.
Otherwise, when your life is in danger, you will transform, Inuyasha.
The next time I transform...
I might use these claws and tear you apart...
Kagome...
Hey, you there, Totosai?
Huh?
We need to talk.
I was expecting you around now.
Geez! Where did Inuyasha go anyway?
Kagome, don't you have any ideas?
Uh-uh...
Inuyasha no doubt wants to make Tetsusaiga lighter.
Maybe he's training somewhere.
Think so? I don't think Inuyasha would be that diligent.
Shippo!
In any case, we'll just have to search every place we can think of.
Yeah...
I haven't told the others...
but Inuyasha is going through a lot of suffering now.
That's why I think it's better to leave him alone...
but I can't just sit still and wait.
Inuyasha...
I'm so disappointed in you, Inuyasha.
How can you let Tetsusaiga's weight hinder you still?
Shaddup!
That's why I'm asking you for a way to make it lighter!
There must be something!
Why don't you work it out yourself?
I'm in a hurry!
I don't want to transform anymore.
Hmm...
Just'cuz I can't master Tetsusaiga...
I was cornered by that petty demon...
and I lost my senses.
I never want that to happen again. It gave me the creeps.
Hmmm...
Hey!
Master Inuyasha, I'm glad you're fine...
Owweee... I was worried about you.
Hey, Old Myoga!
How dare you keep it from me!
Huh? What are you talking about?
Don't act innocent!
The connection between Tetsusaiga and my transformation!
Kagome told me...
that Tetsusaiga serves to suppress my demon blood.
Hmm... that Kagome!
I made her promise not to say a thing.
So now I know...
but unless I'm strong, my sword can be taken from me.
I have to master Tetsusaiga, or else...
Hmm... so you've put some thought into this.
And you've had enough of transformations.
Yeah...
Well, I guess it can't be helped.
Huh?
Inuyasha, go and kill Ryukotsusei.
Ryukotsusei?
Ryu... You said Ryukotsusei?
Ryukotsusei, Inuyasha...
is the demon your father battled and put under seal.
Inuyasha...why do you think this new Tetsusaiga is so heavy?
It is because your fang embedded in the blade...
has not yet reached the power of your father's fang.
In other words, if I destroy the demon my father fought...
I'll surpass my father?
Now listen, Master Inuyasha, to destroy...
as Ryukotsusei still remains under seal...
all you have to do is stab its heart.
What? I don't have to fight him?
Of course not!
Even your father barely managed to seal it.
He wasn't able to finish it off.
Damn... and I'm supposed to kill it while it's asleep?
If you keep complaining, I will not show you the way!
Who're you talking to?
- Err... well... I... - Me?
- Hey! - Don't!
Interesting, Kanna.
You... Kagura... Goshinki... Juromaru... Kageromaru...
None of you were able to kill Inuyasha.
Let's test this Ryukotsusei.
Old Myoga, aren't we there yet?
Just a little further.
You'll be able to see it soon.
Damn!
Old man!
Huh?
What do you all want?
We're looking for Inuyasha. Do you know his whereabouts?
Inuyasha...
Hmm... Inuyasha?
Inuyasha, huh?
It involves Tetsusaiga, so we thought he'd come to you.
What'll I do?
You know, don't you? Where is he?!
Oh boy...
I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Inuyasha has gone to the Valley of Ryukotsusei.
The Valley of Ryukotsusei?
Master Inuyasha, over there!
So that's... Ryukotsusei.
Correct.
And look at the seal...
where your father's claw has immobilized him.
Ryukotsusei's heart lies beneath it.
Naraku!
But, Master Totosai...
if there was such a way, why didn't you tell it to him earlier?
That'd have been too easy.
If it's too easy, he won't learn.
But Inuyasha has suffered enough.
Kagome...
He agonized over it, then decided to come to you.
That's true.
Even if they were bandits, he did kill human beings.
Hmm... that's why I told him.
If he felt nothing after killing humans, he has no right to wield Tetsusaiga.
Naraku! What're you up to?!
Huh?!
The claw that seals Ryukotsusei!
Listen, Ryukotsusei.
The one over there is the son of the hated man who put you under seal.
Fight him to your heart's content.
N-No! Let's run for it, Master Inuyasha!
What are you blubbering?
I didn't like the idea of prickling someone held under a seal!
I'll face him head on and make Tetsusaiga lighter!
Come at me!
Little man! You say you'll kill me, Ryukotsusei?
Not a bad idea for entertainment.
I'll have some fun with you.
Fun?!
No! It's hopeless!
Such an eyesore!
Hmm... Ryukotsusei isn't bad at all.
It should be easy for him to kill Inuyasha.
What a good show.
I'll enjoy this.
A mere demon puppet.
It didn't even serve as a warm-up.
So you were going after Naraku from the start?
Hey, little man...
I hope you'll give me more fun than that.
Be more than happy to, Ryukotsusei!
W-what's he doing?!
What's this strong evil aura?
W-what happened?!
Old man... could it mean Inuyasha is?
That fool! He's awakened Ryukotsusei.
I've never felt such a powerful evil aura.
Does that mean Inuyasha is fighting such a formidable foe?
Kagome!
Let's go, too!
Hey, wait!
Oh boy... what a bad day this is.
Come at me, little man! I'll have my fun with you.
Stop talking so big!
The scar left by my father's claw...
If I pierce through it...
Tetsusaiga will become lighter!
Tetsusaiga...couldn't pierce it!
Just because it's for fun, doesn't mean you have to go easy on me.
My body is harder than steel.
M-Master Inuyasha! This is hopeless!
Shaddup! I just got started.
I already told you...
even your father barely managed to put this Ryukotsusei under seal!
Not only that, the wound inflicted upon him during the battle...
ultimately killed him.
W-what?
Oh... so he died.
Little man... you're his son, huh?
Could it be you came to avenge him with that silly sword?
As if I'd care about avenging him!
Hey!
You've been saved countless times by Tetsusaiga, your father's heirloom!
Shaddup!
Ungrateful son!
I'll have nothing to do with you!
Running away, are you?!
Damn!
The reason why this new Tetsusaiga is so heavy...
is because my fang, used to forge it...
isn't up to par in strength with my father's.
Yes...
I must somehow destroy Ryukotsusei...
and surpass my father!
Such an ominous evil aura!
This is bad.
But how did Ryukotsusei's seal get broken?
As if I'd know...
But what a problem this poses.
Huh?
If Ryukotsusei acts up once more...
this plain of Musashi will become a field of ashes.
l-Is he that frightening a demon?
Uh-huh.
How can we defeat such a demon?
There's only one way to defeat the reawakened Ryukotsusei.
He must use the Backlash Wave.
Backlash Wave? What is that?
It is the ultimate technique of Tetsusaiga.
You mean it's even stronger than the Wind Scar?
The Wind Scar is a trick for a beginner.
But...
Inuyasha can barely wield Tetsusaiga, not to mention the Wind Scar!
Let alone the ultimate technique...
I guess it's impossible.
Ouch.
Master Myoga... did you abandon Inuyasha again?
Kagome!
Inuyasha!
Stay alive!
So weak.
You're not worth tormenting.
It won't relieve my anger towards your father for putting me under seal.
Do you not understand...
with such an inferior sword...
you cannot kill me?!
Tetsusaiga!
You must not part with Tetsusaiga.
When your life is in danger, you will transform, Inuyasha.
Tetsusaiga...
I see them! Over there!
So easy...
Dead, already.
Huh?
W-what's with him?
Inuyasha!
Inuyasha isn't holding Tetsusaiga!
Inuyasha!
K-Kagome...
Inuyasha transforms into a demon.
If we stay here, he may come after us as well.
What? Totosai? You say we have to fall back?
I will not abandon Inuyasha!
He's trying all by himself so hard to discover his true power.
Just then, Tetsusaiga begins to pulsate.
Backlash Wave: Tetsusaiga's Ultimate Technique
Don't miss it!
