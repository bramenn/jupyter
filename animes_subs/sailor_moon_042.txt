Minako's boyfriend is a handsome boy who was born in London!
But what do you know?!
A pretty older lady named Katarina showed up.
What to do? What to do with this love triangle?
Anyhow, anybody who makes a girl in love cry,
in the name of the moon, Sailor Moon will punish you!

Sailor Venus's Past, Minako's Tragic Love
Let's see.
Not here...
Not here, either.
That leaves...
Sorry for being late.
Oh, I am dead tired.
How was it?
The Japanese confectionery store we checked
wasn't the doorway to the Dark Kingdom's hideout.
I see. So these aren't the places either.
Monsters are being sent in
one after another from the Dark Kingdom.
There has to be a doorway for them somewhere.
Rei, how about the places you guys checked?
No leads whatsoever.
Not one place that looked like the entrance to a hideout.
That just leaves us with Minako.
I'm so tired!
Usagi, everyone's working hard, so be a little more patient!
But, I'm starving!
What did you just eat at that confectionery?
Three plates of sweet dumplings and two cups of jelly with fruits!
It was yummy!
But that's not close to being enough!
You guys are pretty rowdy in here.
How was it?
Big disappointment.
We checked all the public baths in Tokyo, but we found nothing!
I see. Thanks for your hard work.
Why don't we call it a night and go home for today?
Good idea.
Usagi, we're going home!
What is this?!
This is...
It's the same as that other time.
What other time?
The way the sunspots are spreading...
It's just like when the Moon Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
What?!
When the sunspots blanket the sun,
I shall be brought back to life from my eternal slumber.
Queen Metalia will be revived?
Once Queen Metalia is revived
and we get hold of the Silver Crystal, the world will become mine.
The day you will hold the Silver Crystal should not be too far away.
What?
I found somebody who knows Sailor V's true identity.
What's this?
She is a policewoman,
who works for Interpol in England.
I received information that she used to care
for Sailor V like a younger sister.
It sounds interesting.
Sailor V is certain to be related to Sailor Moon in some way.
I will leave this matter to you.
Yes, my lady.
What is happening?!
This man possesses the same wavelength of energy that I do.
He is worthy of inheriting my energy.
What's wrong?
Tuxedo Mask...
You must have had a bad dream again.
I understand how you feel, Usagi,
but it's bad for you if you keep worrying.
You need to get enough sleep and eat properly.
I know...
I have no problem with eating properly, but...
I guess I just wasted my time worrying about you.
Somehow, looking at the moon makes dumplings taste better.
Oh, I'm so happy!
Sorry, Usagi!
What's wrong, Artemis?
It's terrible! Minako's disappeared!
Water... Give me water!
I wonder if she found the passage
that leads to the Dark Kingdom's hideout?
Give me water!
If she did, she would take me with her.
Water!
Don't you have any idea where she might be?
There is one thing.
She got a phone call from a woman named Katarina.
This might have something to do with that woman.
I thought I was gonna die!
Idiot.
Minako...
No, Sailor V.
I was surprised when I learned that you were well.
Why didn't you let me know that you were alive?
I hear you still transform into Sailor V to do good deeds.
Yes.
I want to help you, too.
Say, you're friends with the sailor warriors, aren't you?
Won't you introduce them to me?
What about Allan? Is he doing all right?
Yes, he's fine.
Allan wanted to see you, too.
Katarina, I guess you kept wearing that necklace.
Of course. You gave it to me for my birthday, after all.
Anyway, I want to be of some use to you, too.
Please, introduce me to the sailor warriors.
Katarina, you are a great international police officer,
but this is our problem.
I don't want to expose you to danger!
I'm glad I had a chance to see you again. Thank you.
Good-bye!
Minako!
Wait!
Master Kunzite...
It does not seem more questioning will help us.
Transform into the monster, Papillon, and attack that girl!
Papillon!
Allan...
Minako...
Allan...
A butterfly at this time of year?
Who's there?!
If you died once, you should just let me kill you!
You're a monster, aren't you?! All right!
Venus Power Makeup!
What?! Minako was Sailor Venus?!
Crescent Beam!
You're wasting your time.
What?!
I know the way you fight. Take this!
I know your weaknesses, inside and out!
You're Katarina? Why?
Now, tell me the identity of your friends!
Katarina, please...
Sailor Venus!
Oh! What should I do?! That monster looks tough!
Usagi, let's get on that thing and get out of here!
What?! That's impossible!
I don't know how to pilot a boat!
Then, why don't you turn into a sailor?!
Oh, right!
Okay, then!
Moon Power! Turn me into a cute sailor!
Let's get out of here while we can!
Okay!
How did you find me here?
We hit all the hotels that had a Katarina staying there.
Then, we found out she was staying at
the Hillside Hotel with a view of the pier.
Where did they go?! I won't let them escape!
Anyway, we have to...
It's coming!
All right, time to go full speed ahead!
It looks like we'll make it!
Usagi, thanks a lot!
No problem!
Usagi, let's find shelter in that luxury liner anchored over there!
Roger!
I can't go any further!
Quit dragging your feet!
You were just sitting on my head!
Anyway, let's hide somewhere!
Where are they hiding?
It looks like there's nobody here, after all.
But don't let your guard down.
The monster is aware that we got on this ship.
By the way, Venus, you were calling that monster Katarina.
Just who is she?
Luna, sometimes, there are things people don't want to talk about.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It was just about six months ago.
I got information
that one of the Dark Kingdom's monsters was in England,
so I went to London.
There, I fell in love with Allan, whom I'd met.
Then, one day, I came across a crime in progress.
Wow!
It's amazing!
Thank you!
After that, we became good friends.
She taught me English
and acted as my confidante too.
I adored her like a big sister.
And she took care of me like I was her younger sister.
Katarina! Allan! Hurry!
I also introduced Allan to Katarina
and the three of us had a lot of fun together.
Then, one day...
Minako!
Allan...
Allan, Minako was... Minako was...
What happened to Minako?!
Be strong. You have me.
That was when I first realized
that without my knowing it, Allan and Katarina had...
I disappeared from both their lives.
I thought it would be happier for them if I just pretended that I was dead.
So, you came back to Japan and...
You devoted yourself to fighting against the enemy
to try to forget those sad memories.
No!
I don't like that. That's so terrible.
Usagi...
Are you so happy you're going to be killed by me
that you're crying?
This place will be your grave!
I'm in a bad mood right now!
You better watch out or you'll get hurt!
Moon Prism Power Makeup!
What?! You are Sailor Moon?!
At this point, I don't care if you found out who I am!
I'm a sailor warrior of love and justice, Sailor Moon!
In the name of the moon, I will punish you!
Enough of your nonsense!
I won't run away today!
I'll never forgive anybody who crushes an innocent girl's love!
Die!
Moon Tiara Action!
Please save her!
What?
She was turned into a monster because of me!
She knew I was a sailor warrior.
That's why the Dark Kingdom used her.
None of this is her fault!
You adored her like your own sister and she betrayed you!
Please help her.
But she stole your boyfriend!
He...
But she's the person Allan fell in love with.
Please.
Okay, then!
Moon Healing Escalation!
Refresh!
Katarina!
Katarina!
Minako...
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I didn't know your feelings.
I thought you were still a child.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
What in the world happened to Minako?
She looks so sad.
Shouldn't we go to her side?
We should just let her be by herself.
What?
Because Minako is much more grown up than we are.
This is how it should be.
Because the person he chose is Katarina.
As long as they're happy, that's all that matters.
That's all that matters.
