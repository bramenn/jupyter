A recently opened restaurant in a corner of Hargeon, 8island.
I would like a blue-sky with meat sauce, and a holly soda-poyo.
I'd like the beast-man curry.
Right! Thank you for your order!
Smile
Would you like some dessert with that?
If it's love and dreams and you it'll become magical.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
I kind of admired this powerful world,
chock-full of problems.
Frozen time has started to move again
ever since I met you.
Why were we born? Why do we live?
I don't need any complicated answers.
Laugh! Cry! Be honest with yourself.
Simple feelings are the most important.
You can change those tears shed on sad nights into strength.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
Then I'll also take one of these ruby parfaits-poyo.
Same for me.
Coming right up.
Please take my order, too!
Yes, coming!
Wait... What the heck am I... am I doing?
Lucy.
What?
This is part of the job, you know.
I don't see how this is a job for wizards at all!
And what's with this embarrassing getup?
How should I know?
Well, I do look pretty damn good in it, actually.
Right, whatever.
The chef at this restaurant uses magic to cook.
That's why he wanted his waiters and waitresses to be magic users as well.
Yup.
We're helping out too, you know.
Don't eat the customers' food!
And don't throw the serving tray!
Sometimes dressing up like a waiter is pretty nice.
Try saying that after you put on the outfit!
Come on now... Whose rent are we doing this for again?
Sorry...
And besides... Look.
Let's hear your order.
What is it you desire?
Come... Tell me...
Uh...
I-I want!
Yes!
Please give us one of everything!
Oh? That will be a great help.
I must give you my thanks.
Glad to be of service!
We got someone really into it...
I'll work hard too...
This is yet another battle to be won!
Allied Forces, Gather Up!
Well then... Good work, everyone.
Kids these days sure do work hard...
Come back any time.
Yes. I learned a lot today.
She's into the outfit...
I think I understand better how Mira-chan must feel...
Man, what a feast!
You ate too much of the store's food!
What's the big deal about it?
What's with your attitude?
By the way, Yajima-san... What has happened with the Council?
Well, I've already retired.
The Council?!
What, you didn't know?
Yajima-san used to be a member of the Council.
Zuuku...
Or was it Zullal?
Jellal.
Ah yes, that's right.
The betrayal of Zullal and Ultear was quite the blunder for the Council.
Now should be the time to establish a fresh, new Magic Council,
and the groundwork for it seems to be being laid in all quarters.
It caused you all quite a lot of grief, it did...
I am really sorry about it.
No... I've heard that you were set against firing Etherion the entire time.
And you even retired out of shame for the actions of the Council.
I'm not fit for governing...
As I thought...
I have a lot more fun being a cook!
By the way, Natsu-kun, Gray-kun...
There will be a new Council now.
I won't be there any longer.
That means that no one will be there to speak up for Fairy Tail.
Be sure to behave in a way that keeps that in mind!
We'll behave!
Say hi to Macky for me!
Thank you very much for today!
Ultear, huh?
I wonder where she is now...
This is the ship of the Dark Guild Grimoire Heart.
Oracion Seis is what?
I see... So they're making their move.
And this woman, Ultear, who used to be a member of the Council,
has actually been a member of Grimoire Heart from the beginning.
What do you think, Master Hades?
Leave them be.
With them making their move, the ones on the other side will not be able to stand silent.
We will take that opening to find the key to unlocking the seal on Zeref.
Let us hope that they are able to take the opportunity to eliminate the pesky guilds.
Like... Fairy Tail?
What's this?
It's an organization chart of the Dark Guilds.
Yes. I drew it.
When you look at it overall, there are quite a lot of them.
Why?
Because lately it seems like their activity has increased.
We have to strengthen the bonds between guilds.
What's the big oval?
Juvia knows. It is the Baram Alliance.
The Baram Alliance is the most powerful force of Dark Guilds,
combining the three guilds of Oracion Seis, Tartaros, and Grimoire Heart.
Each of them have a number of associated guilds,
and they control the world of Dark Guilds.
Then there's the guild that acts independently of the rest, Raven's Tail.
Huh?
Eisenwald?
Yes. That's the guild that Erigor was in.
So that was one of the guilds associated with Oracion Seis, huh?
There's a lot of names that I remember up there...
Aren't there some that used to be official guilds, too?
Ghoul Spirits, the one that the Raijin Tribe destroyed, was also one of them.
And the guilds Juvia and Gajeel-kun destroyed when we were in Phantom
were all from Oracion Seis!
Please, don't go smiling about it...
Uh-oh... I hope they're not angry...
Don't worry'bout it! There's nothing to fear!
From the rumors I hear, they've only got six members!
Damn, how small a guild is it?
But even with only six people, they're a member of the strongest organization.
About that Oracion Seis...
We're going to attack them.
How was the regular meeting?
Way to miss the point!
Master, what are you talking about?
At the regular meeting the other day, we discussed the recent activity by Oracion Seis.
As it is not something we can ignore, we decided that some guild has to fight them.
You pulled the short straw again, Gramps?
And Fairy Tail will take on that role?
No... The enemy this time is too powerful.
If it were only us, then afterwards the Baram Alliance would retaliate only here.
And that is why we have formed an alliance ourselves.
An alliance?
Fairy Tail!
Blue Pegasus!
Lamia Scale!
Caitshelter!
These four guilds will each send out members to strike these guys down!
But we could handle it ourselves, no problem!
Or actually, I could even handle it myself!
Naive fool! The Master is thinking about the consequences afterwards!
So... Wait a second...
The enemy only has six members, right?
How crazy powerful are these people, then?
I can hear it...
The sound of the breaking of the light!
Don't be so hasty, Cobra.
Well, being hasty ain't so bad.
That magic we're talking about is hidden here, Racer.
A magic that will bring about darkness and break all light, yes!
Nirvana...
The legendary magic will finally be ours.
Is this Nirvana magic really all it's cracked up to be?
Behold. The land has begun to die.
Just because Nirvana is nearby.
Why do I have a feeling like something really bad is going to happen?
And wait... Why am I participating in this again?
It's not a picnic for me either, you know.
Stop complaining.
The master chose who went.
Shouldn't we be happy he trusts us with this duty?
But when it comes to fighting, there's Juvia or Gajeel...
Well, the two of them had other jobs to do.
So... Are we... there yet?
In the end, it's the usual gang.
Don't you think that's for the best?
This will be the first time teaming up with other guilds.
The first thing that's important is forming better ties with the other guilds.
I can see it!
There's the meeting place!
This place's decor is seriously creepy...
This is Master Bob's villa, from Blue Pegasus.
Him?
Master Bob, from Blue Pegasus.
FYI, a man.
I-I'm not so good with him...
Now, now, don't go there.
He's powerful enough to give our own master a run for his money, despite...
I see...
Are we there yet?
Yes, we're here, Natsu.
Yes, you've arrived!
Arrived!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Fairy...
Fairy...
Sorry to keep you waiting!
We...
Trimens!
Hibiki of the Hundred Nights!
Eve of the Holy Night!
Ren of the Silent Night.
Trimens from Blue Pegasus?
How cool!
And the one called Hibiki...
He's always at the top of the I wish he were my boyfriend ranking in Weekly Sorcerer!
You're that Hibiki Laytis!
Crap! I forgot to put on clothes!
Those guys? Not a chance...
Your beauty doesn't do the rumors justice.
How do you do, Titania?
Now, come this way.
Have a hot towel.
Are you hungry?
No...
We have cake. How about some?
I'll pass.
What's going on here?
You... Have a seat yourself.
And hey... You're just too damn cute.
What's with them?
Who are they?
Let's work together for this plan.
We need to combine our strength and...
So cute...
That demeanor of yours... it's wonderful.
I've always looked up to you.
I-It's not like I made it specially for you, or anything...
Now he's tsundere?!
Come... You must be tired from your long journey.
Spend tonight with us...
Forever!
Guests...
Stay right where you are.
What's that silky smooth voice?
It's Ichiya-sama!
I-Ichiya?
It has been quite a while, Erza-san...
I can't believe it... You're joining us?
I've longed to see you, My Honey.
Ichiya is here, at your service!
*sparkle*
My Honey?
Erza is...
What an unexpected...
What an unexpected...
Wasshoi!
Wasshoi!
Wasshoi!
Wasshoi!
Wasshoi!
Wasshoi!
You're Ichiya-sama's girlfriend?
How rude of us!
I deny it, with all my might!
Clean up!
We didn't come here to play around.
Right, Boss! Right, Boss!
Weren't they calling him Ichiya-sama before?
They're not consistent, are they?
I've heard about you.
Erza-san... Lucy-san...
Excellent parfum!
Parfum is French for perfume.
You're freakin' me out, you know...
Sorry... I can't really handle him either.
He may be an incredible wizard, but...
Listen up, you crappy Blue Pegasus boy-toys!
How about you stop makin' passes at our princesses, huh?
You men can go home now.
Thanks for coming!
Thanks for coming!
They send posers like you on an important mission?!
I could wipe the floor with you!
Try us.
We're strong.
A fight? Let me join!
Stop it, you two!
Erza-san...
Your parfum is incredible, as always...
Stay away from me!
Men!
She went and did it!
Men...
This is quite the greeting.
You consider yourselves equal to Lamia Scale?
This man is Lyon Bastia.
He was once a disciple under the same teacher as Gray, and his elder.
Lyon?
Gray!
So you joined a guild?
Men!
Men!
Men...
Men... Handsome men...
What the hell are you doing?
He started it.
What do you think you're doing with our General?
How awful!
I think all the men should just leave.
Oh? But there's a woman here as well.
Doll Attack!
Carpet Doll!
Me?!
And wait... That magic...
Shelly!
You also joined Lamia Scale?
This woman is Shelly Blendi.
She is an ally of Lyon, and is madly in love with him.
I won't allow you to say you've forgotten me.
And please, forget who I was in the past!
Make up your mind!
For Love, I have been reborn!
M-More parfum for me!
Stay back!
I'll cut you!
Lyon!
Gray!
Bring it on!
I cannot love you.
And I hate you, too!
Cease this!
We are making an alliance to defeat Oracion Seis!
This is not the time to be fighting amongst ourselves!
Jura-san...
Jura?
He's the ace of Lamia Scale... Rockiron Jura.
Who?
He's one of the 10 Great Wizard Saints!
Even I've heard his name before...
The Fairies and Pegasus all have four people...
But for us, just three is more than enough.
How cruel! Why don't I ever count?
With this, three of the guilds have gathered.
All that is left are the people from Caitshelter.
People? I have heard it is only one person.
One person?
They only sent one person for a mission as dangerous as this?
Wait...
How crazy dangerous is this guy?
Owwy...
Um...
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm Wendy, from Caitshelter.
It's nice to meet everyone!
A kid?
A girl!
Wendy?
We sure have a bunch of different people together.
And a couple of old faces, too.
Plus, one of us is a Wizard Saint!
But we're up against people who are powerful enough to take on entire guilds themselves.
Seriously?!
But if I get serious, I can handle...
No, you can't.
Next time: Oracion Seis Appears!
As long as you can't beat Erza, it's out of your league.
I'm very gifted!
You're not supposed to say that about yourself.
