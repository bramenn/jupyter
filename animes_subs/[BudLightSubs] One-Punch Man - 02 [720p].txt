What could be the cause of the massive mosquito outbreak this year?
We ask Mr. Kafetch,
a mosquito expert who has written several books on the subject.
Thank you for having me.
Well, let me come right to the point.
These mosquitos belong to an entirely new species.
Therefore, I know nothing about them.
Get out!
Ah, excuse me.
Now, let's take a look at the areas
Man, City Z's in their path. likely to be hit hardest by the outbreak.
Now we've got a mosquito outbreak?
We interrupt this program for breaking news.
A large swarm of mosquitos has been sighted in City Z.
Mummified remains of attacked farm animals have also been found.
If you encounter a swarm of mosquitos, flee immediately.
This is an emergency evacuation warning. Threat level: Demon.
No resident is to go outside under any circumstances.
I repeat, no City Z resident is to go outside
Acquiring target.
THE LONE CYBORG
Thanks to that warning, they're all empty!
Like someone's gonna die from a mosquito bite.
What's losing a little blood if I get all this?
The wind?
What the?!
Come on, you guys. That wasn't nearly enough.
Go get some more for me!
Target acquired.
I see.
You make them suck the blood, then take it all for yourself.
You must be controlling the mosquitos via some sort of signal.
That would explain their mysterious behavior.
So if I were to get rid of you, the leader,
would the swarm disperse too?
Our next meal is here. Go drain him dry.
Incinerate.
I am about to eliminate you.
Stay where you are.
You, eliminate me?
Go on and try!
Got you.
Damnmosquitos!!
Incinerate.
Maybe a leg next?
Wait, where are my legs?
Impossible.
You cannot escape from me.
What the hell is that guy?
He's gonna get me if I don't do something.
The townspeople may all be hiding,
but there are plenty of animals around.
Come here, little ones.
Empty all your stored juices into me!
So many.
If she's been collecting blood from the whole town and beyond,
then it may not simply be a food source for her.
I should put an end to this as soon as possible.
Get back here, dammit!
You and I aren't done yet!
What's with this guy?
It's in my mouth! Pft! Pft! You little!
Huh?
What's that squirming over there?
It's...mosquitoes?!
You over there.
Evacuate now.
That swarm is conscious.
If it senses you, it will immediately attack.
Seriously?
That's bad. I gotta get
Since you spoke, I thought you would have at least human-level intelligence.
But you were just a bug.
You brought all the mosquitos together into one, easy-to-burn swarm.
When I spotted you,
I confirmed there were no living beings within 500 meters,
so I should have been free to fire away.
Wait, that guy might have
Man, you saved me. You're amazing.
What was that just now? You totally made them bug out!
Ba-dum-dum-tsh.
Oh, I was just trying to make a joke about the mosquitos being bugs, and
Idiot!
I no longer need the tiny ones.
I mean,
look
how strong I've become!!
Can't your punches kill a little mosquito?
Weakling!
I see.
The more blood she consumes, the more powerful she becomes.
I think I'll have your head next!
I let my guard down. There's no chance of winning.
All I can do is self-destruct.
Forgive me, Doctor...
Mosquitossuck!
Hold on!
Please tell me your name!
Oh. It's Saitama.
I'd like to be your disciple.
Oh, okay.
Huh?
Sensei!
You really showed up.
Uh...
It's Genos, Saitama-sensei.
Can you not call me sensei?
Master!
Not Master either!
Go on home after your drink.
I'm not looking for disciples.
Waityou're back in one piece?
Yes, my body is mostly mechanical.
As long as there are parts, repairs are quick.
You're an odd one.
What kind of parts do you use, Master?
Don't use any.
Then what about the skin-colored armor on your head?
Yeah, that's my skin.
But that would mean you're bald despite being so young.
So I'm baldwhat's your problem?!
Me? You'll listen to my problems?
No thanks, I'm good.
Actually, four years ago, when I was 15, I was still a real human being.
Did you hear what I just said?
Although we had to pinch pennies,
my family and I lived a peaceful and fairly happy life.
But one day, a crazy cyborg went out of control and attacked our town.
The insane cyborg...
Most likely, a failed body modification generated an irregularity in his brain.
He destroyed everything in sight.
Parks, schools, buildings, my house...
He even took my family's lives.
Miraculously I survived, but being only a weak 15-year-old,
I was alone and at the end of my strength in a ruined town.
That's when Doctor Kuseno happened to pass through.
Doctor Kuseno, a scientist for justice,
was on a mission to stop the destruction caused by the rampaging cyborg.
I asked Doctor Kuseno to perform body modification surgery on me.
That's how I was reborn as a cyborg who fights for justice.
I promised Doctor Kuseno that one day I would terminate the evil cyborg.
I see
It's been four years since that day.
I'm now 19 and I've been wandering from town to town eliminating evil.
The number of monsters and criminal organizations I have destroyed
are too many to count.
But I have been unable to find any clues about the insane cyborg
and have become increasingly frustrated and restless.
I find myself chasing a virtual image of that cyborg
whenever I square off against my enemies.
Then last week, when that mosquito monster appeared,
I let my concentration slip.
I was convinced I could not lose to anything but the rampaging cyborg,
so I neglected to even analyze the data on my opponent and rushed to confront her.
The result, as you know,
was that an opponent with immense strength bested me.
If you, Master Saitama, had not been in the area,
I would have undoubtedly been destroyed.
Master, you saved my life.
My life that was once saved by Doctor Kuseno
has now been saved again by you, Master Saitama.
I feel the weight of that responsibility.
I must not die before destroying that cyborg.
And to do that, I must continue fighting evil as a righteous cyborg
until he appears before me one day.
I need to get stronger.
Last week, when I saw your punch,
I knew I had to study under you as your disciple.
If only I could be as strong as you, Master Saitama!
I have an old enemy to defeat,
and the battle is not for me only.
It's for my hometown, and for Doctor Kuseno too.
I realize I am still inexperienced.
But right now, I need enormous power
so I can eradicate the greatest of evils!
Doctor Kuseno is
Enough, you idiot! Shorten it to 20 words or less!
Mosquito Girl was defeated?
With one punch, you say?
Well, she was merely a prototype, after all.
Why is he naked?
Unknown.
Well, whatever.
He'll make an excellent specimen.
We shall study his physiology by force if necessary.
Send a messenger and invite him here,
to our House of Evolution.
Please teach me the way to become strong like you.
Genos Yes!
How old are you?
19.
So young
I'm sure you'll surpass me in no time.
Do you mean that?
I'm 25 now, but I was 22 when I started training in the summer.
Sure, I'll teach you.
But it won't be easy. Can you handle it?
Yes, sir!!
Object approaching at high speed It's here!
What?
My name ishuh?
Pay for my ceiling!
So...
Hm?
It seems our advance agent, Kamakyuri, is down.
I can't sense him with my telepathy anymore.
What? Wasn't he one of our stronger guys?
There are two more outside.
Master, leave them to me!
Don't bust people's ceilings!
Oh, never mind.
Can't you guys just come through the door?
M-Master!
No, I'm fine.
I kinda feel like abamboo shoot.
Elevated energy levels detected.
A cyborg?
Could it be...?
You are not the target.
What's going on? I can't see.
You are in the way!
I have a few questions for you.
It would appear you're in what they call a tight spot.
Well done, Ground Dragon!
GROUND DRAGON
It complicates things if they put up a fight.
Master!
You dare look away?
Quite courageous!
I am the pinnacle of the House of Evolution's science.
I am Armored Gorilla.
Your attacks have no effect.
The House of Evolution?
What does it want with my master?
It is none of your business.
And it is our rule that any who oppose us be eliminated without fail.
I must destroy you.
Hey, jerk-off!
What's with that look?
Being underground keeps you cool,
but at the same time, its nice and warm.
I'm sleepy. Could you get lost?
I see I need to teach you your place.
Listen up! I'm gonna slice your eyes out with these!
Then we'll see if you resist!
The Beast King never lets anyone off easy.
Well, enough fooling around.
If you wanna apologize, now's your chance.
You guys smashed my ceiling!
Humph. Fine.
Then behold the true power
Aw man of the Beast
I got dirt in my special place.
Hey, are you listening?
Let me just shake this out.
You done?
One sec.
I'm done.
Okay, then behold the true power of the Beast King!
Lion Slash!
You okay, Frog Man
Outta the way, pissants!
Such is the law of the jungle!
And you're next!
Wait! Don't kill him yet!
Lion Slash: Meteor Power Shower!!
Consecutive
Normal Punches.
Oh.
N-No one told me he'd be like that!
It's best we retreat now and regroup...
Found you!
No waayyy!
Huh?
Answer the question or be eliminated.
Your choice.
It is you who will be eliminated.
You fool.
I am the third most powerful fighter in the House of Evolution.
At your power level,
you will never beat the Beast King, the second most powerful.
You will be destroyed.
Is this who you mean?
Apparently so.
Look, I'm really sorry.
I'll tell you everything, just don't kill me!
What the? What happened to your robot voice?
Sorry, I was just trying to sound cool.
What do you mean? The hit team wiped out?
How did this happen? Wait, don't jump to conclusions yet.
It may be a mistake. Verify the report immediately!
Right away. Be careful!
What's all the commotion?
NEXT EPISODE: THE OBSESSIVE SCIENTIST Okay, time for Mosquito Girl's episode preview!
Next week's story will be about my birthplace.
I was bornwhat?! Time's up already?!
Oh, all right.
The next episode of One-Punch Man is episode 3, The Obsessive Scientist.
Scientist, huh? Who could that be?
