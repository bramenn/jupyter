that we are misunderstood
Is it just me, or are things getting worse?
Yes, that anomaly is gradually descending upon us.
We're receiving similar reports from around the world.
If this continues, Earth will be...
What's the status of the three pilots?
Still unable to confirm their location on any of our sensors.
I'm starting to understand
how those guys felt
when they chose to abandon Earth 20,000 years ago.
Hey! Look at that!
It's getting worse!
Aren't you afraid?
I am afraid,
but I have just as much faith in Madoka.
This may sound funny coming from a relative of hers,
but she's never let us down, not once.
When I want something to happen...
She always finds a way to come through, no matter how serious she needs to become to do it.
She'll fly to heights I can't even imagine.
I can't stand this!
I have to do something!
Where are you going?!
Where?!
I don't know!
The only thing we can do is to wait!
We have to trust Madoka and the others, and wait.
Against the Vox,
we're so... powerless!
Oh, here you are.
Is he still asleep?
Boss... What are you doing here?!
I came by to bring Madoka her lunch.
So, are you guys okay?
Y-Yes, we managed to escape.
I see.
I'm glad.
Well, you guys can lend me a hand.
What do you think happened to your brother, Lan?
I don't know.
Does this mean he was able to get back to the outside world?
Oh look!
Brother?!
The person next to him, is that...?
It's Yurikano!
Brother!
Brother!
Hey...
The sound of the waves...
Yeah...
It's gone?
This space we call the Rinne is connected
to the hearts of those with a Memoria.
Your will has changed this place.
In other words...
The three of you have changed that man's heart.
Please go.
This place will close up soon.
What about you, Yurikano?
I'm staying here with him.
What?
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not doing this because I love him or anything.
Many lives were lost because of us, and I must atone for that.
I'm sure he feels the same way.
No, you can't do that.
If you really want to make up for your mistakes,
then you have to start by being honest with your feelings.
Come on, let's go back together.
We'll take Lan's brother with us too.
Don't worry!
Even after we leave here,
the Sweats Club will be there to help you.
We're comrades!
Not bad for something put together on the fly.
Now, let me hear it...
the continuation of where you left off 20,000 years ago.
Here it comes!
Cap! Look at this!
The aurorae are combining into one?!
That noise...
What is it?
The sound of the waves?
No, this is...
When I hear a voice that moves my heart,
It can't be!
I'll put on sweats and give it my all.
Duty and obligation alone aren't enough to convince me.
I leave it up to my heart to decide,
A song?
A song?!
Is this for real?
on whether or not to take on a request.
It's the Sweats Club Song!
Move forward! Move Forward!
Run! Run!
That's the Sweats Club spirit!
Cap! It's Aura, Lympha and Ignis!
I have their signals!
Vital signs normal!
All three pilots are alive!
Where are they?!
Yeah!
They did it!
Did we make it back?
Snap out of it, Lan!
Look below. We made it home, to Kamogawa!
I see.
Then this is...
Is something the matter?
No.
For a second, I thought this was the ocean on De Metrio.
Lan! What's wrong?
It's my brother! He's...!
Delicious!
I never thought I could have your Kamogawa soup on board Pharos!
More!
It's all gone.
Huh?! But I'm not full yet!
How much do you plan on eating?
It's going to be okay.
Asteria said there's nothing to worry about.
Right.
I was also made younger, by about ten years, after returning from the Rinne.
I don't know what happened over there,
but he probably made the same wish as me.
To have a second chance in life
and pick up from where he left off.
Big Brother...
The Rinne was a very magical place.
If you wish for something strong enough with all your heart,
the Rinne can even reverse time itself.
That's what happened to Lan's brother.
If you had gone there,
would the same thing have happened to you, Big Brother?
You know, I didn't change.
I thought I would be turned back,
back to the me when I was always with you, but I didn't.
It looks like I love the way I am right now.
Which is why...
I'll be going.
Yurikano!
Hey. I'm back.
What?!
Is that all you have to say?!
Yurikano!
What's the matter with you?!
Why did you leave us like that,
Yurikano?!
Don't ever leave without telling us again, you hear!
When you go, it'll be with the four of us together!
I'm sorry... and... thank you.
We're getting damage reports
from branch offices around the world.
It looks like our work is just getting started.
Is something the matter?
No,
it's just...
I feel like we've forgotten something very important.
Aaarrrghh!
I can't get that song out of my head!
Don't tell me that's the voice of the one?
No, it couldn't be!
That casual march can't be the voice!
It has to be more...
Majestic, yet plaintive, but profound!
Otherwise it's meaningless to name that universe the Rinne!
That means I made up that legend for nothing!
Oh, forget it.
The Rinne isn't gone. And the Vox are still here.
I'll simply have to start anew.
Now then, bon... appetit...
Hello!
Hi!
This is a surprise.
Are you two on vacation?
I just got off my early shift.
I'm on break since
our Space University is closed for Golden Week.
There's Golden Week in space?
Anyway, since we don't
get much chance to see each other anymore...
We thought we would drop by to give Madoka photos
from our graduation trip.
Huh? Miss Yoko?
Weren't you leaving today?
I am.
Are you waiting for Madoka?
I came by because she wanted to ask me something.
That's the ocean on Le Garite.
When I called earlier, she said she'd be here today.
It's like Madoka's gotten even busier since she graduated.
She's just like Auntie.
Are you talking about Madoka's mother?
I always wondered why she was always so busy.
I could never quite figure her out, despite being her kid brother.
I'll be going now.
I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my time waiting for her.
Take care.
I will.
Where will you be going this time?
Who knows?
Our Chairman is full of curiosity.
She mentioned something about the Bermuda Triangle
holding the key that connects the Rinne to the depths of the Earth's oceans.
So I'm guessing that's where we'll start.
I hope today and tomorrow will be a happy day for me, and for everyone else.
Mom...
Whoa! You surprised me!
Weren't you supposed to be leaving today, Big Sis?
I came all the way here because you said you wanted to ask me something!
Ow- oww!
So, what did you want to talk about?
You have one minute.
You know that time ten years ago,
when I nearly drowned?
Yeah... What about that?
I remembered why I went into the water that day.
Did I ever tell you?
No.
I jumped into the ocean because I wanted to see Mom.
Obviously, she wasn't there, and the next thing I knew,
I was drowning.
I thought I was going to die, but that's when Midori poked me.
Maybe that was Mom telling me to snap out of it,
and to live.
What do you think?
Big Sis?
Believe what you want to believe.
That's the answer.
Yeah.
You're right!
Hello?
Oh, the Le Garite...
What?!
Was that today?!
But it's still a week away on Earth!
Why do I have to dress like this?
You certainly can't attend dressed like a cook.
Wait, so you're really going to become a cook?
Now's a good time to ask.
Do you even know how to cook things besides pasta, Izo?
That fried egg thing you made was delicious.
So simple, yet profound.
You guys are making fun of me, aren't you?!
Now we're talking!
I was starting to think that you wouldn't show up.
I had a hard time finding sweats that would fit me.
How's everything going for you?
As you can see, life can't get any better.
Huh?
What's that?
It's the flower
that bloomed on the ship that left Earth 20,000 years ago,
and has since been cared for by the Le Garite royal family.
You're giving it to me?
To De Metrio.
We're not kings anymore, remember?
All the more reason you'll be able
to keep a single flower in bloom, right?
I guess we really are starting over from scratch...
Hello?
Nah, I wasn't trying to skip out or anything.
I'll be back right away.
That was my new boss.
We're the Kamo-Girls' Sweats Club, Kiss Branch.
Want to join?
Branch Chief.
Yes, what is it?
Do I really have to call you by that title?
Yeah! After all, Madoka is the captain!
Do we have to call ourselves the Sweats Club?
We have reports of yet another miracle resulting
from the abnormal meteorological phenomena which took place late last year.
With regard to the Polyhedron 1000-year problem and measures to deal with the impending collision
of Le Garite and De Metrio,
a detailed study conducted by a committee
noted a large change in the orbits of both planets...
Novumundus Chairman Asteria Lizamarie De Roschefall,
now also the committee's chairman, promised to make public all data.
Hello?
Three days from now?
We can't. We're helping with setting up the shopping district for the summer festival.
And released a statement saying: It means everything's perfect now!
May I ask your name again?
And you're the Secretary-General of which United Nations?
Hey Madoka!
You're going to be late!
I know!
I'm very sorry, but I have to get going.
Send me an e-mail with the details.
I promise we'll be there!
Can't go anywhere in the Polyhedron without this!
I'm going!
You're late, Madoka.
We were getting tired of waiting.
Sorry about that!
Hey!
Your lunch.
Oh, I forgot.
I made lunches for you two as well.
Thank you very much.
Can't do without this.
Bye, Uncle.
We'll be helping out at the Space Fireworks Festival,
and then be at the De Metrio Nursing Home recreation meeting...
Don't forget our visit to the children's home in the Pa-Dros Star System.
We also have to attend a clean-up demonstration at the Intergalactic Debris Meeting.
I'll be coming home at...
I'm not sure, so I'll call you.
Okay, be careful, now.
Oh, by the way.
Everyone loved the song you girls sang
at the unveiling of the Tanpopo Children's Park.
Woof!
Roger that!
Perfect!
On the water's surface I see a light reflected that stirs my heart
When we realized our bond,
we were already deeply connected under the blue sky
We had so much fun, as in a daze, that time seemed forgotten
I prayed that there would be no end to the way we lived
I won't forget our days together, although time goes by,
and you are far from me now,
because you left behind a wonderful world
for me to wait in
