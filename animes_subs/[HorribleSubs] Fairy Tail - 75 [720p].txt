Hey Natsu, don't you think our guild has a whole lot of special events?
Yeah... There's the that big parade, the Fantasia...
Then there's the hanami bingo tournament...
And don't forget about the Miss Fairy Tail contest!
Wait, did you win that, Lucy?
Please don't ask me that... Seriously.
So cool!
It's that time of year again! This grand event is here!
Fairy Tail's traditional All-Wizards Mandatory Participation 24 Hours Road Race!
And I, Jason, from the Weekly Sorcerer, will be doing the play-by-play!
I'll be giving you the cool scoop on this hot event!
24-Hour Endurance Road Race!
Here he is!
The unbeatable titleholder for this road race, Jet!
Rumors say he's compensating for being mostly useless on quests!
Hey!
Just rumors, man!
Damn that Jet... He thinks this year's gonna be a walk in the park again.
Oh yeah? I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Victory is mine!
Nobody who says victory is mine ever actually wins.
I gots me a super-secret weapon.
A secret weapon? You're such a little kid.
All right, let's do this!
You're drinking? Right before we start the run?
I can't run without fuel, right?
I figured you'd say something like that, Cana.
Everyone's really revved up, though.
No one wants to face the punishment, after all.
Last year was horrible...
What punishment?
Quiet, everyone!
All members of Fairy Tail!
A wizard is one with both strength of mind and body!
I wish for you to utilize those powers to the utmost in today's competition!
Do we really need smarts for this?
Seems pretty much just physical endurance to me.
The rules are simple!
You will run as fast as you can from the start line,
then here along the appointed course, heading for Mt. Ivor!
This year, I have left Wyvern scales at the top of Mt. Ivor!
You will take one of those scales, and return here within 24 hours!
I won't accept any dropouts.
If you are a Fairy Tail Wizard, then you will run the distance,
all the way to your next job tomorrow!
Furthermore, I am imposing a new regulation this year at the urging of many...
Flying magic is forbidden!
Other than that, any type of magic is allowed!
He's one crafty old fox...
Every year he just goes overboard...
And of course, the person who comes in last
will face a punishment of which there is nothing scarier on the planet!
Isn't this all because the master looks forward to giving out the punishment?
Last year was just awful...
It's only one person, though.
As long as you don't come in last, what's the problem?
That is a quite logical way of thinking.
But it is far too negative!
Oh, yeah?
I compete only to win.
This is a special outfit that reduces my muscle fatigue,
allowing me to run continuously for a long time.
She's really going for the win...
Happy. Today only, we're rivals.
I ain't gonna go easy on you.
I know!
But...
This new rule sucks big time.
D-Dark!
Now... It's finally time for the start!
Everyone, to the start line!
Levy, watch my start!
I don't have time for that!
He just wants to show you how cool he is.
You probably don't realize, Lu-chan, but I couldn't watch him at the start if I wanted to.
Ready!
Bam!
Here I go!
High Speed!
Pulling away right at the start is Jet again this year!
Couldn't see him, right?
No kidding...
Seriously?!
Check out my secret weapon!
It's Fists of the Fire Dragon boosters!
Jet, Natsu! That's totally not right!
Lucy-san, Levy-san, if you'll pardon us!
Today, everyone is our enemy.
You really don't have to be so polite.
Crap!
We're the last ones!
Now then, who'll be getting the punishment?
I can't wait!
Sorry, Happy!
See ya!
Jet's already running off by himself!
And behind him, Natsu!
The idea of using his Fists of the Fire Dragon as boosters is totally cool!
Then there's Erza and Gajeel leading a huge pack!
Who will it be that makes a break for it?
Let's hear from our expert commentator, Mirajane!
Jet's so fast...
Pict Magic!
What a cinch!
Everyone, fall!
That's what you get for layin' back and paintin'!
Ice Make Floor!
All's fair!
Gray, you bastard!
Beast Arm...
Iron Bull!
Gray-sama?
This is tough work...
You drink too much, Cana!
You look just as tired as me, Wakaba!
I didn't think I'd gotten this out of shape!
Can we even make it to the goal?
You guys are pitiful.
Learn from this, and lay off the booze and tobacco a little.
What is this?
Runes?
Is it Freed?
He's booby-trapped the course!
Exactly.
Are you never going to let us out?
I know he said anything other than flying magic is allowed, but this goes too far!
I never said you couldn't go free.
What are these?
Practice Questions for the Magic Four-Wheeler License Exam?
This one's Practice Questions for the Level 3 Four Elements Sorcerer Qualification?
Freed, what's the meaning of this?
To escape from these runes, you must answer all the questions, and get them all correct.
What?!
If this race purports to test both physical and mental strength,
then this little side game is entertaining as well as fitting.
If you feel bitter, blame yourselves for falling into my trap.
Hold it, Freed!
Blame ourselves?
It was you who activated the runes...
We were just caught up in it!
We've got no choice!
We'll solve all the problems!
Do them yourself!
Forgive me, friends!
You meanies!
She is brave for not using magic.
Runes?
Titania!
Your senses are as perceptive as ever!
You may have noticed the rune trap, however...
Breaking my running rhythm is a serious offense.
Now I have to get my rhythm back...
Erza, let me out of here!
Hey!
After getting past his tricks, she zings one back at him!
The race has gotten completely unpredictable!
No one wants to face the punishment.
Oh?
There's movement near the top of Mt. Ivor!
Could it be?
It's Jet!
The pre-race speculation was right on the money, as Jet is the first to reach the summit!
He took a Wyvern scale!
Now all he has to do is come back!
Jet's speed isn't waning in the slightest!
Who will get there next?!
Ah, I'm beat...
I can't go on anymore. I need a little break.
Lu-chan, you have to keep going!
But my legs won't move!
Levy-chan, you go ahead. I'll catch up.
Okay.
I'll be going now.
My legs hurt...
Is there anything I can make use of?
Anyone good to rely on at a time like this...
Gate of the Maiden, I open thee!
Virgo!
You called, Princess?
Carry me up to the peak!
And do it on the double!
As you wish.
This'll be a breeze!
Full speed ahead!
I depart!
Lu-chan?
I'm gonna fall! I'm gonna fall!
Let me down, I'm scared!
What lovely water...
The fatigue is washing right away...
Ah, Gray-sama...
Sorry for earlier.
Juvia was also scared of this punishment, so she didn't help you, and instead went on ahead!
But Juvia is tormented by what she did!
Until Gray-sama comes to this place, Juvia will rest herself in this cool water...
Like this...
Was that... Juvia-san?
Ah, the water-user.
While she was soaking in the water, she must have changed herself to water by accident.
Have you seen Juvia around here?
Seriously?
Gray-sama!
Go, go, go!
Whoa there, they stopped!
Out of fuel?
Well, I was going full-power all this time.
Gajeel!
Outta my way!
Gajeel, you bastard!
Can I eat that fire?
It's been 12 hours since the start!
The moon has already risen over the night sky!
Right now, the wizards are taking Wyvern scales one after another
and blasting on to the return course!
Finally, here...
Oh, Happy!
Natsu!
Thanks, Natsu!
I'm taking off.
Don't slack off on the way!
I know!
Fists of the Fire Dragon!
The 24 Hours Endurance Road Race!
We're well into the second half! Cool!
All the wizards, with Wyvern scale in hand,
are racing full speed toward the Magnolia South Gate Park!
Still in the lead is Jet, as always!
Next up is Erza, who doesn't even look winded!
The next group is Gray, Lucy, and Gajeel, who are still running strong!
Cool!
Behind them is the full pack in pursuit, not losing focus for an instant!
Who will be coming in last?
Who will be receiving the punishment this year?
You can't miss a second!
Bunch of slackers...
Let's liven things up a bit.
Cool!
The race has entered the final stage!
The super-high-speed Jet is so fast, we've completely lost sight of him!
But!
Natsu and the rest are gutsily gaining ground!
Cool!
Everyone has worked hard through the night.
We had better switch to our seats at South Gate Park, and get ready to watch the finish!
Huh?
Jet?
Are you asleep?
Hey, Jet!
Wake up, Jet!
Hey, Happy.
Should you be sleeping now?
I overslept!
Everyone's gone ahead.
Thanks, Happy.
I gotta make up for lost time!
It's the last spurt toward the goal!
The battle for second is heating up!
All right! We can see Magnolia!
What?
Oh, what's this?
Jet?
What? He wasn't in the lead?
Why is Jet behind us?
Wait, then that means we're in contention to win?!
Why?!
Jet is catching up as fast as he can!
So fast! Passing them in a flash!
I don't think so!
Requip!
A rabbit?
Is this your trump card for the last spurt?
Huh?
She's not catching up...
That's actually really slow for a rabbit.
She must've bought it based on the way it looked!
Maybe she's more about appearances?
Hold it, you guys!
Now in Magnolia, Jet's finally neck and neck!
The winner has been narrowed down to one of these 5!
Fists of the Fire Dragon!
As if!
Requip!
Natsu's fists are out of fuel!
Is he out of contention to win?
It's not over yet!
Yeah! Never count Natsu out!
He's digging deep into top groove to close in!
I won't lose!
I won't lose!
Victory is mine!
There's a huge crash!
Wait, who's that cool cat coming up?
It's Happy!
Happy is here!
Happy?
Yes, the goal is right ahead!
All right!
I won!
Congratulations, Happy!
Yes! You ran well!
Aye!
Goal! Happy is the winner of this year's 24 Hours Endurance Road Race!
History has been made! Nothing will ever be the same, folks!
Cool! Cool! Cool!
I did it!
You've got to be kidding me.
He got us.
The cat?
Not a bad ending, I say.
He woke me up.
Ah well, I'll let him win this time.
Wendy?!
Carla?!
Whoa there!
Coming in second is Wendy, and third is Carla!
The top three spots are occupied by these three Fairy Tail pretties!
What?
This is...
No one wants to face the punishment!
Don't step on me!
What's this?!
A battalion of wizards all crossed the goal at once!
Quick thinking Erza also crossed the goal.
Gray-sama, hurry!
Natsu!
Everyone, hurry!
Shoot!
Crap!
Easy for you to say!
This ain't no joke! High Speed!
What?
Jet!
Go-go-go-goal!
The 4 of you crossed at the same time!
What?!
This year was whacked out!
This finish was cooler than cool!
Coming in last was, incredibly, Natsu, Gajeel, Gray, and Jet!
We know who'll get punished!
Are you prepared?
You're kidding, right, Gramps?
Gramps! At least let us have a tie-breaker!
No!
I won't hear any more of your pitiful excuses!
For a wizard, there are no do-overs, for jobs or otherwise!
Stop acting like babies and take your punishment!
All four of you!
Fine, I got it!
I'll do whatever!
Tell us what the punishment is.
There! That's the spirit.
I will now announce this year's punishment!
Right here!
Weekly Sorcerer?
What about it?
The four of you will do a super-embarrassing photo spread for the issue two weeks from now!
A super-magnificent 20 pages, together with a one-week, all-access interview!
A super-embarrassing photo spread?
I'll go buy a display and preservation tools, Gray-sama!
Don't do that!
Now then, everyone... Let's go right ahead and start picking out clothes!
Wait!
Oh, hell no!
Wait! Cool!
They're running again?
Seems they still have plenty of stamina.
As expected.
I don't think that's what it is.
Gray-sama's photo spread!
By the way, Master...
I won, so do I get something nice?
You already did!
You got the joy of winning and everyone's cheers!
There is no greater honor, am I right?
Wait, seriously?
That's it?
Seriously...?
Aww...
Gildarts has finally come back?!
Aye! He's been away on a quest for who knows how many years.
I can't wait to meet him!
Yeah!
When he gets back, I'm challenging him right away!
Even though you'll just lose?
I'll win this time.
Definitely win!
Have you ever won after saying that?
Next time: Gildarts.
Happy, prepare a party to celebrate my first victory!
Aye!
I'll prepare for a better luck next time party!
Were you even listening to me?!
