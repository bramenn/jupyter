All righty then! It's finally time for the last battle!
I like fish, but I can't stand dogs.
What brought that on?
Lily, I bet you've got something you're scared of, don't you?
Of course not!
Absolutely not!
I wonder about that...
Fairy Tail was challenged to an all-out war with the strongest Dark Guild, Grimoire Heart.
In the fateful battle between Gray and Ultear, Gray pulled out a victory.
Now the only enemy left is Master Hades.
Against Hades, who has stronger magic power than any opponent they've ever faced before,
Fairy Tail begins the final battle of Tenroujima by joining together to fight.
The weather is taking a turn for the worse.
Lightning... I don't like this.
What's the matter, Lily?
Don't tell me... You're scared of thunder?
Looks like he's got some cute points.
Quiet, you!
Now then...
Let's go beat Hades!
Lucy! Happy!
Aye, sir!
M-Me?
Thunder Roar!
We're on the same team, right?
I know, but wouldn't Fried be more suited...
I have to stay here and draw runes.
Leave the defense to us!
I'll go with Natsu-san and Lucy-san!
Wait, Wendy!
I think I can at least support Natsu-san!
I-I'll go as well!
I have to pay them back for Gajeel.
I'll stay here and help Fried with the runes.
I'll stay beside Mira-nee and Elf-niichan...
Then that decides things.
We will protect everyone, period!
Lu-chan! Be careful.
I've recovered most of my magic power.
Hades is probably the only enemy left!
This looks to be the final battle...
We're gonna do our best, too!
I got it already!
Exceed Squad... Move out...
Let's get going!
Yeah!
Lucy, wait a second!
Always stay by Natsu's side.
When Natsu has a trusted friend beside him, he gets even stronger.
Sure.
Wait... right... there...
What the hell is she?
Hand Zeref over!
What about the love or whatever you were talking about?
I don't want to fight you!
Meldy.
Zancrow!
Where are you taking Zeref, huh?
I-I'm...
So you and Ultear-san are gonna betray us after all?
No!
You ain't a member of Grimoire Heart any more!
Zeref will be ours!
Wait...
Zeref is Ultear's future...
My... future...
Naive fool!
How long are you gonna keep saying that?
Ultear promised me...
If we went to the World of Great Magic, she'd turn my town back to normal!
Your town?
Oh, yeah... Hikaru and I were there back then, too.
Ultear-san promised?
Except that it was Ultear-san who destroyed the town herself!
You're... lying.
Acnologia.
I am sorry, man whose name I do not know.
I have burdened myself once again with darkness.
Thank goodness... You two seem safe.
You see, I have no intention of doing anything in this age.
I will become no one's ally, and no one's enemy.
However...
If this age is now coming to an end...
I wanted you to destroy me before that happened...
Natsu...
That word he just said...
Acnologia?
Damn it...
I can't keep my eyes open...
I can't go on...
Erza...
You okay?
Looks like I keep getting saved by other people.
I am no different.
Everyone!
Gray!
Erza-san!
Same with me!
To think that the 7 Kin of Purgatory and Bluenote would be done in...
Perhaps I should just admit it, and praise Makarov's troops.
Honestly... Me, having to face these foot soldiers?
The games played between demon and fairy are now over.
Well, now... Shall I play with you a bit?
The 3rd generation Fairy Tail!
Come, if you dare, Makarov's brood!
You come down here!
He thinks he's all that!
He's the one who hurt the Master!
If we can just teach that guy a lesson, then we can all leave the island safely, right?
Yup! We'll all get out of here!
Happy... I have a request for you guys.
What is it?
Search around the ship for the source of its power, and destroy it.
It'd be a problem if it started to fly again...
Understood.
Leave that much to us.
I'll cast Troia on you just in case.
Let's get this party started!
Here we go!
We'll head out, too!
Infiltrate from the ship's bottom!
He's a wizard on an even higher level than our Master!
We're going to go all-out from the start, at the same time!
Right!
I'll give him every last bit of power I have!
We don't have time to think about what comes afterwards!
I finally get to punch this guy!
I'm all fired up!
Hades!
Taste the power of Fairy Tail!
Fairy Tail's... power?
Black Wing: Moon Gleam!
Cold Excalibur!
Gate of the Golden Bull, I open thee!
Tauros!
Magically enchant everyone's attack power, defense power, and speed!
Arms!
Armor!
Vernier!
Annoying brats.
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
Natsu!
Got it!
Go!
Roar of the Sky Dragon!
Scorpio!
A Unison Raid?!
Sword Edge of the Fire Dragon!
People says that their mistakes become experience.
But a true mistake does not leave one with any experience.
For those who make the mistake of facing me, they have no future left at all.
That's...
Not even a scratch?!
Whoa...
We were going all out back there!
The nature of his magic power... has changed?
Now then...
I think that should be enough warm-up exercises.
Brace yourself!
Wendy!
Wendy!
Destroyed without even a trace left?
Pitiful.
Maybe I will just erase the rest of you one at a time.
Wendy!
What the hell have you done?
You've got to be kidding me!
Everyone, please calm down.
I am safe.
Horologium!
Thank goodness.
My automatic emergency danger avoidance mode has been activated.
Um...
I kind of remember being in a whole lot of danger myself...
The danger level was far greater this time.
I am very sorry.
Thank you very much, Horologium-san.
Just as annoyingly roundabout as always...
And wait, why are her clothes all that's left?
It was an emergency, so only the person themselves was protected.
Wait, then that means...
Wendy, in there you're...
Kya!... she says.
Now, please change into these.
Anyway, we're in your debt. I give you our thanks.
I can only protect you this once.
Everyone, please be very careful.
Thank you, Horologium!
So this is Makarov's brood, eh?
This will be fun after all...
You know Gramps?
What? He didn't tell you?
Are there no records of me left in the guild's library, I wonder?
I was once the 2nd master of Fairy Tail.
I took the name Purehito.
Liar!
I was the one who chose Makarov as the 3rd guildmaster.
As if we'd believe that!
Stop spouting such crap!
Natsu!
I dance with magic!
Hey!
What happened to the sound-proofing on this ship?
I can still hear the thunder loud and clear!
Yeah, yeah...
It's fine!
It won't hit the ship!
Let's try over here next.
Stick with us, Lily!
There's no doubt...
How could I mistake that?!
I definitely heard...
Acnologia?
Did Zeref really say that?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't even move.
It doesn't matter now.
If Zeref really said Acnologia...
R-Retreat!
All troops, retreat!
The investigation of Tenroujima is over and done with!
T-There's nothing that can be done.
It's over.
I'm sorry.
Do fairies have tails, or not?
An eternal riddle...
In other words, an eternal journey.
As I recall, that was the reasoning behind the name of the guild...
But your journey will end soon.
Mavis's will was entrusted to me.
And my will was entrusted to Makarov.
But that was a mistake.
Makarov changed the guild!
What's wrong with change?
He exposed magic to too much sunlight!
That's our Fairy Tail!
We ain't a living corpse like you!
We live our lives by putting everything on the line, bastard!
If you don't have the courage to change, then just stop right there!
Pipe down, little devil!
Natsu!
If you want to blame someone, blame Makarov.
Stop it!
It is Makarov's fault that you will die suffering!
Stop!
You...
Revenge... for Gramps...
Enough. Begone.
Don't!
It hit!
Calm down!
So this is the guy who hurt my old man?
Natsu...
Laxus...
Boy!
Do fairies have tails, or not?
What do you think, Natsu?
Sure they do!
A fairy without a tail is like stir-fried vegetables without any meat!
What's with the nutty metaphor?
And besides, if you add meat it turns into a different dish!
Then, it's like stir-fried vegetables without the vegetables.
Then what is in it?
Next time: The Man Without the Mark
And besides, we were talking about fairies, not stir-fry!
Whatever, let's eat! I'm starving!
