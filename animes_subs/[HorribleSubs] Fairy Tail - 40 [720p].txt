Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Together?
That's not it, Erza.
Siegrain and Jellal were a single person!
Then, Etherion was unleashed, and the true form of the Tower of Heaven was revealed.
I want her to be her usual self when she wakes up from this nightmare.
So I will fight!
I wonder if Natsu and Erza are okay?
They're fine. Because they're both Fairy Tail wizards.
You've got that right. All we can do now is believe in them.
I'm all fired up! More than I've ever been!
You little brat!
I'll end this in an instant!
I'll send you to Hell regretting the fact that you ever stood up again!
One thing I know is that I can be real stubborn.
If you're gonna do it, then give me your best shot!
Whoa, there!
Bring it!
Titania Falls!
Natsu!
What's wrong? That all you got?
You scared a breakin' the tower, so you're holding back?
That ain't gonna work on me, bub!
You ain't gonna talk so big for long, you brat!
Dazzling Blaze of the Fire Dragon!
He's... the tower...
The...
The tower I spent 8 years constructing...
How dare you!
Well, what a shame...
I told you, remember? My specialty is destroying stuff.
Natsu... He can barely even stand...
You won't get away with it!
What's with this magical power? It's making me sick...
The shadows are extending backwards to the light source!
Oh, no! This magic is...
Fall into the infinite darkness, dragon wizard!
Jellal!
Will you let me be killed as well?
You need a body to resurrect Zeref, correct?
Yes.
It's a general requirement that the body be of a wizard
about as powerful as one of the Ten Wizard Saints.
But at this point, it doesn't have to be you anymore.
Die together, both of you!
Erza, move!
You have nothing to fear.
I will protect you.
Stop it!
Altairis!
Erza!
Whoa...
It exploded!
They're okay... Right?
Sho, what's happening?
What is this unsettled feeling I have...
You're...
Simon...
Erza...
Simon!
Still crawling around here?
You worm...
But, why?
Didn't you escape?
Simon!
I'm glad...
I understand! Now, no more talking!
You were...
Simon...
Simon!
Simon!
I love...
How pointless! How incredibly pointless!
They call that throwing away your life, Simon!
This doesn't change a thing!
Because there's no way anyone is leaving this tower alive!
Shut up!
He's...
The crazy bastard is eating Etherion!
That's insane!
Ethernano is fused with other elements than fire, you know!
Did you seriously think you could power up
by eating such powerful magic energy instead of flames?
That kind of peabrained thinking will lead you to your own downfall!
He's actually absorbing Etherion?
You're the reason...
I made a promise!
Natsu, take care of Erza.
I made a promise!
You cocky bastard!
Meteor!
You'll never be able to catch me at this speed!
Impossible! I can't lose!
I'm making a kingdom of freedom!
Zeref whispered to me in my pain and fear...
Do you desire true freedom? Zeref beckoned...
That's right. Only I can sense Zeref!
I am the chosen one!
Zeref and I will create a truly free kingdom together!
And you'll make it by taking away other people's freedom?
Only ones with the will to change the world can make history!
Why can't you understand this?
Abyss Break?
You fiend! You plan to destroy the tower as well?
8 more years.
No... This time I'll finish it in 5.
Zeref, wait for me!
You will never find freedom!
There is no such thing as freedom for somebody taken over by ghosts!
Free yourself first, Jellal!
What in the world...
What's happening?
That's got to be Natsu.
Yeah, I agree.
But, is that gonna be okay?
It'll be okay... Or so I'd like to think.
But he sure is going wild there...
This is... Natsu's true power.
This is...
He even defeated Jellal...
The battle I've been fighting these 8 years is now over.
Now, everyone is truly free...
Natsu!
You're really incredible...
Really...
How pretty!
No, that's...
I can feel a terrible magical power coming from that light!
Wait... Then that means...
Could Etherion be going out of control?
Out of control? Why?
The magical power of Etherion...
Keeping that great amount of magical power in one place can never be stable for long.
A turbulent vortex of magical power with no where else to go will burst out,
causing a giant explosion...
Whoa! We'll be caught in it as well!
What about Sister and the others still inside?
This isn't about who's saving who anymore!
We're all going to be wiped out together!
Simon...
Magical power strong enough to deform the container... The lacrima...
That's even more destructive power than I had imagined.
Even if we get outside, we'll be caught up in the explosion.
Damn it!
Is this the end?
No... There's no way I'll give up.
Now it's my turn to save you, Natsu.
But it's impossible to hold it back.
What can I do?
The tremendous amount of magical power this lacrima now stores,
will be fused into your body.
Your body will be deconstructed, and then reconstituted into Zeref's.
Fused?
If I can fuse with Etherion, then can I control this power? Can I stop the explosion?
I've got to take the chance.
Good. The lacrima is still accepting me.
Erza...
Natsu?
What are you doing?
Erza... You're putting yourself into the lacrima?
This is the only way to stop Etherion.
Stop Etherion?
Yes. Look around you.
This tower will shortly explode as Etherion goes out of control.
But if I can fuse with Etherion and suppress it...
What are you saying, you idiot!
If you do that, you'll...
Erza!
Don't worry about it any more!
I'll stop it for sure!
Don't!
Stop it!
Erza!
Natsu...
I couldn't have lived without Fairy Tail.
A world without my friends is unthinkable.
You are all just that important to me.
Erza...
If I can save everyone...
Even if it takes this body...
Erza!
Get out of there, Erza!
Natsu, take care of everyone for me.
Because I'll always be by your side...
Erza!
It's exploding!
No, it's not!
Etherion is heading up into the sky!
It disappeared!
Etherion went into the sky!
Erza! Natsu!
That's such a horrid wound...
It will be quite difficult for you to see again, yes...
Now, now... I'm asking you nicely so no complaining.
She's got such a pretty face, have some compassion would you?
Come here a moment.
Owww!
You're not thinking of laying hands on her when she's older, are you?
O-Of course not...
Where is she from?
Rob was helping her out...
Rob?
Where is he now?
It seems he's dead...
How is it?
It's healed!
Can you see?
Yes...
Then get out, immediately.
I hate humans, get it?
It's healed...
You... That eye...
You're only crying out of one eye...
That shouldn't be...
I didn't make an error while mixing the medicine...
And yet...
It's okay.
I've already cried out half my tears, you see.
Where am I?
Natsu, it seems like our new guild is finally finished!
Ooh! I can't wait to check it out!
It's finally been rebuilt, so don't go destroying it all of a sudden, okay?
Hey, since when have I been the type to go around destroying stuff?
Is he that oblivious? Sheesh...
Next time: Home!
Things break because Gray and Erza go crazy, right?
But it's usually you who starts the fights, Natsu.
So it's all my fault?!
