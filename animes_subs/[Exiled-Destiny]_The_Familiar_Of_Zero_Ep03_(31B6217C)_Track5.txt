Man, it's cold...
Dammit, this is needlessly lacy. It's so hard to wash.
Damn that conceited girl!
What is this?
It's the laundry that piled up
while you were bedridden after doing something very stupid.
All this?!
Of course.
You know...
What?
I heard from Siesta that, while I was hurt,
you looked over me without sleeping, Louise.
So?
Well, now that I can, I'd like to say thanks.
Thanks? Don't you have the wrong idea?
A master takes good care of her familiar as a matter of course.
In the first place, a familiar should always have
a feeling of thanks towards his master, no?
So saying thanks again...
You really aren't aware of your situation as a familiar at all.
Stop with the stupidity, hurry up and go work!
A history of the couple's romance that starts from the first kiss
You, the one who cast magic on this destiny, suddenly appeared
The sky where two moons never fade away
That's an impossibility, right?
This is the first time I've felt anything like this
I'm feeling more and more at ease with this place
Even if you trip and become depressed
I will always hold you tight with a squeeze
The story where we met that day stays hot with a sweet kiss
See, you can cast magic, and the wishes will surely come true
A history of the couple's romance that starts from the first kiss
You, the one who cast magic on this destiny, suddenly appeared
Feverish Temptation
I'm in the same boat as all of those things.
I wonder when I'll be able to get back?
How much longer are you going to spend on laundry,
instead of escorting me to class?!
You really are useless!
Let go! Ouch!
When the laundry is hung up, come to the classroom immediately!
Got that?!
Yeah, yeah.
Fire, Water, Earth, and Air magic create
a different, stronger effect by combining multiple elements.
Furthermore, the level of we mages is determined
by how many elements we can combine.
What are those levels?
Yes, ma'am.
Go ahead.
Two elements combined form a Line,
three elements form a Triangle,
and four elements form a Square.
Well done.
Just a bit more...
I believe most of you can only deal with one element at a time.
Mrs. Chevreuse, I hate to say this,
but a student that can't even use one element,
with a zero percentage rate of magical success, is among us.
In any case, all of you
Oh, I get it. Should aim for a higher...
Oh, I get it.
I finally understood why all the others call you Louise the Zero.
I see. A strange, but correct, way of putting it.
Zero elements, zero success rate of magic.
But you're still a noble! How wonderful!
O Master, this humble familiar has created a song.
Try singing it...
Yes, as you wish!
Lou-Lou-Louise is no-good Louise,
a sorcerer that can't cast any spells!
But it's all right! Louise the Zero is still a girl!
Here...
Here? Here...
Here?
Here... This familiar...
What are you saying to your master?!
Um... Did I make you angry?
Or more like, furious?
One meal taken away for each Zero you just said!
I'm sorry, I overdid it!
I won't say it anymore. Anything but that!
No! Absolutely not!
I will make absolutely no exceptions!
Well...
Impossible. Well...
Impossible.
I haven't said anything yet.
Lunch and dinner... It's been only two.
You still have two more meals to skip.
You're counting?
Nightgown.
And what are you going to do if I starve to death?
Isn't it the master's responsibility to take care of her familiar?
Huh? What about it? Hey, master?
Hey! Come on!
Gross! Don't spit on me!
Fine! I'll make an exception just this once and forgive you!
Really?
Oh, what a kind master you are!
I won't say Zero anymore!
Even if your magic is zero, or your breast size is zero,
no, I will never say so!
My breasts?!
What was that?!
Oh, crap!
No meals after all!
Plus no sleeping in the room tonight!
I think I'll freeze to death before I starve to death.
So cold... So hungry...
Mr. Saito?
I'm sorry they're leftovers,
but eat as much as you want, Our Sword!
Our Sword?
That's right. You're a peasant like us,
but you won the duel against that snobby noble boy.
You're the pride of the peasants, Our Sword!
When I held that sword, my body just moved on its own,
so I have no idea what was going on.
Did you hear that?
A true master is like this, never boasting!
This is where he's different from all those stupid nobles!
I expected nothing less!
Nothing less!
But do they always eat stuff this tasty? Damn...
When it comes to me, Marteau the head chef,
anything will end up tasting exquisite!
This is magic in and of itself.
You're right! I've never had stew this tasty before!
A good man! Saito, you really are a good man!
I like you, Our Sword!
Please, let me kiss you!
I'll hold off from being called that, and the kiss!
Such modesty. As expected!
As expected!
Please come again.
Every one of them is a fan of yours, Mr. Saito.
Thanks to this, I'm now confident that I can survive here.
Though when I got injured the other day,
I thought that I was going to die.
Mr. Saito, you really were in a dangerous situation,
one step shy of a coma.
Is that so?
You only revived after Miss Valliere ordered a terribly expensive elixir.
As a noble, she sure has money to spend.
Um, Mr. Saito?
I would like to have a long chat with you sometime.
Is something the matter?
Uh, no... Someday later.
Yes.
Well, I think it's about time for me to head back.
Good night.
Night!
She's such a good girl!
What?!
You're Kirche's...
If you eat something like me,
you're sure to have an upset stomach!
Is it all right? It won't be my fault!
Hey, are you listening?
This is...
Kirche?
Oh, was it Hira Gasaito?
If you don't mind, just call me Saito.
All right.
Saito...
I know that it's something that shouldn't be.
But my byname is Fever.
I tend to burn like a torch.
Uh, I see.
You still don't understand?
I'm in love with you!
Love always comes so suddenly.
It's certainly sudden.
You looked so handsome when you defeated Guiche!
Seeing it, Kirche the Fever became Kirche the Passion...
Um...
Kirche!
Oh, my, Styx?
I came by because you didn't show up at our promised time.
Then change that appointment to two hours from now.
That's not the deal we had!
This is the third floor, right?
That was...
Just a friend.
Right now, the one that I love the most is...
Kirche!
Who is that man?!
Tonight, I want you to burn up with me...
That was another friend?
That's right.
In any case, the night is short,
and I don't want to waste any time with you!
Kirche!
What are you doing?! You said you didn't have any particular lover!
Manica... Ajax... Gimly!
Well then, in six hours.
That's morning already!
Flame!
Come on...
I love you, Saito!
Um, I have an errand to run.
You know, I'm just a familiar, so I'm really busy. It's true.
Leave them be. I'm much more than Louise the Zero.
She's right, those aren't a zero...
Oh?
Louise? Oh?
Louise? Kirche!
Kirche!
I'm busy right now, Valliere.
Zerbst! Whose familiar are you trying to seduce?!
It can't be helped.
Love and fire are the destinies of the von Zerbst family.
I only wish to burn in flames of love.
Come here.
Wait! He may be your familiar,
but he is a proper human!
It's rather unreasonable to get in the way of someone's romance!
Right, Saito?
That's right! It's unreasonable!
I see...
But you know, when tomorrow comes,
you'll be skewered by at least ten noblemen.
In the end, this is dangerous, in all sorts of ways.
I'll say it one more time. Come here.
Oh, you're going home already?
Cute!
Ouch!
It's just her usual trick! Wake up already!
Ouch... Don't pull so hard, I hear you!
You're going to tear my ear off!
I'm not going to give up just yet.
You're just like a dog in heat!
Sorry!
What is that?
A crop I use for horseback riding.
Crop?
I was wrong...
For accidentally treating you like a human!
Liar!
To think you were wagging your tail at a Zerbst, of all people!
Dog!
Young Miss!
Please, find it in your heart to drop...
I was spoiling you.
If you're a stray dog, I have to treat you like a stray dog!
Wait... First, calm down...
Seriously, stop! Please!
What! What part of that woman is so good?!
Let go of me, fool!
Can it be that you...
Because I was doing that kind of stuff with Kirche,
instead of sneaking into your bed...
You were jealous?
Me? You? What was that?
No, it was just a misunderstanding...
I don't care who you date, but she alone I forbid.
Alone?
Kirche's family, the Zerbsts,
and my family, the Vallieres, have long been archrivals!
It is a disgrace to my family if one thread,
one dog, gets taken by a Zerbst woman! Got that?!
Yeah... Kinda...
You were dragged to Kirche's room in the salamander's mouth?
Yeah. It was involuntary!
How pathetic. You're a swordsman, aren't you?
Who is?
The other day was the first time I've ever held a sword in my life.
You're kidding!
I mean, you were so adept when you were fighting against Guiche.
I don't know...
My body moved on its own the moment I grabbed that sword.
Sometimes familiars can yield special powers once contracted.
For instance, a black cat familiar can learn to speak.
I'm no cat!
And anyway, you can't be a swordsman when you're unarmed!
You're right.
And tomorrow, the day of the week is Void-day...
How's that?
Anyway, hurry up and go to sleep! We're getting up early tomorrow!
What's up with all that?
Where are you going?
Where? To the hallway.
It's all right. Sleep in the room.
You'll be in trouble if Kirche attacked you again.
What is it?
You're really sure you don't feel something for...
Dog!
I'm telling you, it's all a joke!
Idiot! Fool!
How should I seduce Saito today?
I'm gonna fall!
Come on, hold on to me!
Where are you grabbing?!
It's flat enough to be your stomach!
Do you want to be kicked off?!
What, they're going out today?
I guess I can use the old
happen to run into each other while out pattern...
Ansur Rel An...
Tabitha! We're going out today! Get ready!
Void-day.
I know just how important Void-day is to you!
See here... I've fallen in love.
But he has stepped out with that blasted Valliere!
I have to figure out exactly where those two are headed!
You understand, right?!
Oh, right, you won't move an inch unless I explain everything.
I want to chase after the two because they're headed somewhere,
but I can't catch up unless I get the help of your familiar!
Please, help me!
You understand now? Thank you!
I grow fonder of your Sylpheed each time I see it.
Which way?
Well, I was in a rush...
A horse, with two people riding it.
Don't eat them.
Walk a bit slower!
My back is in shambles, you know.
You didn't tell me that it took three hours on horseback.
I think it was right next to Viemont's elixir shop...
Oh, here it is!
Swords?
Lately, it's the fad among even the royalty
to equip their servants with weapons.
You wielded a much bigger sword the other day.
Was that so?
I want one that's longer and thicker.
Pardon me for saying so,
but I believe this is the right size for this individual.
I said, I want one that's longer and thicker!
Sure.
An ignorant noble... She's just asking for it!
Are you buying me a sword?
It's dangerous if Kirche is after you.
You have to have a way to defend yourself.
How unusual for someone so stingy!
Who are you calling stingy?
If I spoil my familiar, he'll get accustomed to it, no?
But I always provide that which is necessary.
Sorry to make you wait.
Amazing!
This is the best item we have in our store.
It was forged by the famous alchemist mage,
Lord Schvert of Germania!
It slices steel ever so easily!
How much?
Three thousand, if you're using new gold coins.
You can buy a nice house and garden with a forest for that much!
A good sword is comparable to a castle.
It's a good deal if one estate will do.
I only have a hundred new gold on me.
What, you can't buy it?
Well, a decent claymore costs about two hundred on average.
Isn't there something that I can buy with one hundred gold?
One hundred? Well, I do have something...
Isn't this junk?
Well, it's a bit old.
Don't worry, plenty of use in it if you tidy it up.
I'll take it.
Thank you!
Something from the clearance bin?
I've had some expenses lately, so I came up short!
Miss Valliere ordered a terribly expensive elixir.
It's an entire millennium too early for you to talk back
about something your master has given you.
Got that?!
Yes, I understand.
That wench came here to woo Saito by buying him a present!
How conceited! She's nothing more than Louise the Zero!
Amazing... It's so shiny!
Do you like it?
What's the meaning of this, Zerbst?!
I just happened to find a sword befitting Saito,
so I'm giving it to him as a present.
So you followed us?
How pathetic. You can't even buy him this cheap sword.
It's hot in here. Maybe I should take my shirt off.
Is that all right with you?
I had mistaken the price. It was twenty-five hundred...
Isn't that a bit expensive?
Is that so? Then, two thousand.
Five hundred.
It's five hundred, right?
Yeah... Five hundred it is.
I'll buy it!
Oh, rats!
I heard this sword was a masterpiece from Germania.
The best swords and women come from Germania.
There's no way a Tristein woman like you can be a match.
Hmph!
I'm sure you just flirted with too many men in Germania,
so that nobody bothered to deal with you,
and that's why you came to study abroad in a neighboring country!
Wasn't that a mouthful?
It's the truth.
What is it?
Indoors.
Then let's have Saito decide.
Me?
That's right. We're fighting over your sword.
Well, if you asked me which, it's obviously...
But...
I don't think this is a simple problem about swords.
Which is it?!
I can't say both, can I?
Ouch!
This is as good a chance as any, so I'll tell you right now.
I really hate you.
Wow, we must get along. So do I!
A duel!
Seriously?
Come on, hold on, both of you...
Hey, shut up! Stupid women!
Stupid?
Women?
No! It wasn't me!
Sword...
You woke me up from my nice nap.
Um, this sword is speaking.
I'm surprised! Such a silly face, and yet you're a user?
No wonder why I've woken up!
A user? What's that?
Isn't that an Intelligent Sword, a sword with its own wisdom?
You sure bought another strange item.
I didn't know! I'm going to return this creepy thing right now!
What year is it right now? Or rather, where the hell is this?
Dammit, answer me!
I'll take this one.
I'm Saito.
It's Derflingher.
Nice to meet you, brother.
Why is it that I get all the strange ones?
As if I were under a real magic spell
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart
But each time I see you, I give you a pointy, cold shoulder
Why do I act mean towards the one that I think about the most?
My true feelings, the shards of loneliness
In the deepest part of my heart, I'm calling for you
For the day to start from zero
Saito!
What in the world are you thinking?!
A mere peasant barging into a nobleman's home?!
I don't care if anything happens to you anymore!
