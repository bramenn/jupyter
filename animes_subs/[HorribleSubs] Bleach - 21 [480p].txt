Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star

What?! What's going on?
What's happening?!
The wall is catching up to us!
The place we just ran through is collapsing!
If you have time to look back, you have time to run!
It's all over if the Restrictive Current swallows you up!
Ishida!
What's happening?!
The fool! It's that crazy get-up he has on!
Hold it!
Do not use your Zanpaku-to.
The current entangles the spiritual body.
If you use your Zanpaku-to, you will get caught too.
T-Thank you
Huh?!
Let's go!
Put me down, Chad! I can run on my own!
Hey, guys.
Something's...
Something's coming!
What is that?!
It's the Cleaner!
It appears once every seven days! And this had to be the day!
Anyway, run! It's incredibly fast!
Hurry! We're close to the exit!
It's no good!
We can't outrun it!
Hinagiku! Baigon! Lily!
Santen Kesshun! I reject!
Is everyone all right?
Wow! Ichigo! The way you land is so artistic!
Shut up!
Cripes That was something else.
This is more than I expected.
I never thought I'd use my extra cape so soon.
H-He brought a change of clothes
I'm so glad No one seems to be hurt.
What's there to be glad about?!
Owwee!
Were you not listening to me?!
We're lucky the Restrictive Current made contact
with just the shield area.
If it had been the Six Flowers themselves,
you'd be dead now!
I-I'm sorry.
So what? Don't be so hard on her.
As it turned out, thanks to Inoue, we came through without a scratch.
You do not understand how serious this is.
I-Is this the Soul Society?
Yes.
This place is known as the Rukon District, the Drifting Spirit Town.
This is where souls first live upon coming to Soul Society,
and is on the perimeter of Seireitei where Soul Reapers live.
It's the poorest place in Soul Society,
but also the freest,
and has the largest population of souls in Soul Society.
Hmm But for all that, there's no one around here.
Huh?
What's that? It looks so different on that side.
Oh that
I got it! That's where the Soul Reapers live the Sei-whatever
Awright!
Y-You fool! Don't get too close!
You'll die!
Huh?
It's been a long time
Huh?
since someone tried to pass through the Seirei Gate without a travel permit.
You're a rare guest...
So the Ryoka have landed outside the Seirei Gate.
Since they're on that side, there's no need for us to go.
Well Especially since on that side
Jidanbo will be there.
Now come at me from anywhere
Kid!
So huge!
Who is he?! He's too big to be human!
Just what is he?
His name is Jidanbo.
He was chosen from among the best in Soul Society
to guard the White Road Gate, one of the four gates of Seirei Gate.
Guard? Which means we have to beat him to get inside?
Yes. But that won't be an easy task
In the 300 years that he has been on duty,
no one has been able to break through the White Road Gate.
He is legendary for his power and strength.
So how do we fight a guy like that?
That's where your intelligence comes in.
I think, first, a meeting is in order to come up with a strategy.
Hey Ichigo
Hey! Chad! Orihime!
Come back! Come back, both of you!
Ichigo, wait I'm coming to help!
W-What is that?!
He's crazy!
I don't like your manners.
You must be country bumpkins.
Now listen up. We have rules in the city.
First, wash your hands when you return from outside.
Two, don't eat food that's fallen on the floor.
Three, when you fight, it's one-on-one.
My first opponent will be that kid with the candy hair.
You wait here quietly, until I'm done.
Inoue
Huh?
I'll wait for my chance and open up a hole in this wall.
The instant I'm done, aim and shoot your Tsubaki at him through the hole.
What?
Are you still scheming something?
He has surprisingly sharp ears
Yeah.
Hey! Chad! Orihime!
Ichigo! Are you all right? You're not hurt?
No, I'm alive and kicking!
Wait over there, we're
About that, Orihime
Can you and Chad just stay put?
Huh?
What're you saying, Ichigo? That's!
Never mind. Don't worry, just wait.
No, I refuse!
Uryu!
Our time is limited!
Instead of just you, we have to attack together, and get going.
Oh, so you're there, Ishida?
I've been here all the time!
Quit saying irritating things at a time like this!
Geez, will you all shut up?
Can you do it?
Umm Probably.
Probably?! What're you saying?!
Huh?
Do you understand the situation?!
Cripes
Look, don't worry.
How can I not worry?!
I'll tell you something interesting
My Soul Reaper strength was supposed to be restored in ten full days.
But I got it back in five.
So what do you think I did the remaining five days?
W-What were you doing?
Fighting. For five days and nights,
I fought that hat-and-clogs guy one-on-one.
I get it You learned the secrets of fighting
Nope
Huh?
He didn't teach me a thing.
But
Stamina and guts
I got'em even if I didn't want'em.
Are you done talking?
I don't remember asking you to wait.
You are a country bumpkin, after all. You don't know your manners.
When someone waits for you you say, thank you!
What's happening?!
What?!
Just what are you?
Isn't it bad manners to attack before your opponent is ready?
Whoa!
H-He's laughing.
You're gutsy.
Good! It's been decades since someone stopped my thrust.
All right! This is great.
Today, I get to give it everything I've got!
Among those who tried to pass through here,
there have been only three, including you,
who were able to stop my first thrust.
Howevernot one has been able to stopmy second thrust!
Hmm Good, you're still standing.
I'm gonna keep coming! Take this!
Jidanda Ten Strikes Festival!
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Six! Seven!
What's happening?!
Seven! Eight!
ErrSix! Eight!
Now it's time for the finish!
W-What?!
W-Why?! Why are youstill standing?!
He's standing! Kurosaki is still standing!
Kurosaki!
I get it!
What Ichigo learned from that guy was not about stamina or guts
or even the secrets of fighting!
Without a doubt, he has spiritual power beyond the norm of Soul Reapers
But he's still clumsy at wielding that power
What he lacked when he confronted other Soul Reapers
was experience!
And once he got that, he's
Are you finished?
He's!
Then it's my turn.
He's gonna be so strong, it'll be scary!
Not yet! Not yet! I'm notfinished yet!
Another axe?!
Try this! My final lethal attack!
Jidanda Banzai Strike Festival!
Sorry, but I'm gonna destroy those axes.
W-What?!
That Kurosaki What'd he just do?!
That giant
went flying!
I slipped and fell on my butt!
Huh? What's that look?
I'll bet you think I went flying. ! What're you saying?
I can't be blown away, never happen!
That's why country bumpkins are such a pain.
Just wait, I'll use my axes again and
A-Axes?
Hmm Jidanbo's axes were destroyed in one blow.
What?! Those giant axes?!
Hey, say something.
M-Myaxes!
Huh?!
They're broken! They're broken!
My axes are
broken!
Now, he's crying. What's going on?
It sounds like a siren.
ErheyI'm sorry about this. For breaking your axes
I didn't have to break both of them, I know
Bad of me
Y-You'renot bad.
You and I are enemies, but you're concerned for me, a loser
What a big heart You're really great.
Err Well, when someone cries that much, anyone would want to console him.
Meanwhile, I'm acting like a kid over mere axes
I'm an embarrassment as a man!
It's my loss!
Huh?
A complete loss! As a warrioras a man
I lost to you completely!
It's been 300 years since I became the guard of the White Road Gate.
I've never once lost!
You are the first man to defeat me.
Pass!
I, Jidanbo, grant your permission to pass through the White Road Gate!
Huh?
Y-Yeah!
Can all of us really pass?
Yes. I lost to your leader. I have no right to stop you.
What?!
Kurosaki is our leader?! No way!
Why're you so upset?
Your name is Kurosaki?
Yeah, Ichigo Kurosaki.
Ichigo, huh? That's a cute name.
Shut up! Ichi means one and go stands for protect!
It's not cute!
Take care, Ichigo.
I don't know why you are passing through this gate
But on the other side, they're all strong.
I know that.
All right. As long as you know.
Okay, I'll open the gate so stay back.
Don't get scared. I'll give it one heave.
Ohhh!
Wow!
Wow...!
A-Amazing!
I never thought that thing could be lifted
What's the matter? Why're you standing there like that?
Did something happen?
Who's that?!
Captain of Squad 3
Gin Ichimaru.
With much appreciation
send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I dont know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move
hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
Youre not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
A mysterious wild boar gang attacks!
The only one who can stop this outrageous bunch is you!
And so, I leave it to you, Kurosaki!
Right! Pararira pararira... Hey, don't run away, you guys!
