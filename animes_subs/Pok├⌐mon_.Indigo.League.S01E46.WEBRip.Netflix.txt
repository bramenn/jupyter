Ash and his friends have been on the road for quite a while now,
so they've decided to take a little break in a beautiful meadow.
Psy-ay-ay.
-Uh, is this the one, Brock? -Yeah. It's called Farfetch'd.
-Wow. -Pika?
Hey, what are you looking at, a new kind of Pokemon?
Uh, there was a rumor that one's been spotted right near here.
It looks like it's holding a leek in its wing.
Yeah.
Farfetch'd, a wild duck Pokemon.
Farfetch'd makes a delicious meal, especially when cooked with leek.
Because of this, Farfetch'd is nearly extinct.
Hey, if it's that valuable, I'll capture it.
There's supposed to be a spring nearby and we need to get some water.
-You want to come? -Yeah, I'll go with you.
-Great. -Will you get some for me?
-Pretty please, Brock? -Sure, Misty.
-Let's go, Pikachu. -Pika.
Thanks, you guys.
Ah, my legs are tired from walking.
-Psy? -Huh?
Psy-i-i!
Hey, I don't have the energy to deal with you.
If I have to look at that face, I'm going to get a headache.
-Psy. -
-Time for you to go back in your ball. - Farfetch'd!
-Psyduck, was that you? -Psy?
- Farfetch'd! -Huh? Who's that? Who's there?
Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...
Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...
Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd.
Wow, I don't believe it. That's Farfetch'd, the rare Pokemon.
Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...
Look at that.
Ha, that's the coolest Pokemon ever.
Oh! While Ash and Brock are gone, I'm going to capture it myself.
- -Huh?
-Hey, wait! -Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...
Wait. Come back, Farfetch'd! Little Farfetch'd!
Where are you hiding? Come out, Farfetch'd!
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
There it is. Uh. Hey, wait! Come back, little Farfetch'd!
Hold on! Please wait for me!
-I won't hurt you, Farfetch'd. - Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...
I'm in no mood for a marathon, Farfetch'd.
-You won't get away from me! -
Ow, that hurt.
-I'm sorry. Are you okay? -Yeah.
It's my fault. I wasn't looking where I was going.
Well, I wasn't paying attention either. I was chasing a Pokemon.
-Oh. Here you go. -Thanks.
-See you. - Bye.
Oh, now I've lost track of Farfetch'd.
Huh? Hey, there she is.
Oh, how could I let it get away?
- Misty! -Huh?
Where'd you run off to?
Oh, I found a Farfetch'd and tried to capture it but it got away.
You tried to capture it?
Have you been sneaking around behind our backs?
Huh? Of course not.
If I caught it, it would have been all of ours.
Yeah, right.
Anyway, Farfetch'd is an incredible Pokemon.
Oh, it's so cute and it twirls it's leek like a baton.
-Huh? -No lie?
I'm telling the truth this time.
-This time? -Oops.
-Here, I brought you your water. -Thanks, Brock.
-Huh? -What's wrong?
-Pikachu? -I must have picked up the wrong backpack.
- -Look.
Just like taking candy from a baby, eh, Farfetch'd?
Fetch. Far Farfetch'd...
Now, let's see what's inside. Five Poke Balls?
This must be all of her Pokemon.
-And now they're mine. -
You bumped into him?
That must have been when the backpacks were switched.
How could this happen?
I had all the Pokemon I ever caught in that backpack!
- -Pikachu.
That was too easy.
- -Huh?
-Farfetch'd. Far. Far. Farfetch'd. What is it, Farfetch'd?
-Farfetch'd. -Hm? Ah.
Are you sure there are Farfetch'd out here in the middle of nowhere?
Trust me, we'll find some.
I hear people are spotting Farfetch'd in this forest all the time.
- Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd... - Huh?
-What's that? -Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...
Far. Far. Farfetch'd.
What amazing luck. We come to look for it and it comes to us.
It tastes good and has good taste.
And it looks so happy to see us. This Farfetch'd is mine.
Hi. Sounds like you guys like my Farfetch'd.
-It's your Farfetch'd? -It already has a master.
-But this is just perfect. - Huh?
I was just planning on getting rid of my Farfetch'd anyway.
You guys want to make a deal with me?
- For that Farfetch'd? -Yeah.
I have a Starmie and a Staryu in here too.
I guess I'm sort of getting tired of raising Pokemon.
I'd be happy to find somebody who'd take them off my hands.
Far. Farfetched'd!
Huh?
Aw, I'm sorry. I forgot something back in the forest.
Would you mind watching my Poke Balls and my Farfetch'd while I run and get it?
Huh?
-Sure, we'd be glad to. -Leave it to us.
We'll take care of them.
Thank you so much. And I'll be right back.
-Be careful. -Take your time.
- Thanks! -No problem.
- -That sucker just lost one Farfetch'd.
This is easier than taking candy from a baby.
Letting Team Rocket guard your Pokemon is like
letting your cat guard your canary.
I can't believe how stupid he is.
And look, he even left a boat for us to make our getaway.
He's done all the work for us.
Too bad he didn't leave his recipe for Farfetch'd flambe.
- Let's get going. - Right.
-And he left a Starmie and Staryu. -Now they belong to us.
Heh, this was the simplest Pokemon capture in Team Rocket history.
Maybe that's the key to success.
Maybe we should just let good things happen to bad people.
-And Pokemon. -We've found our winning formula.
-Quick, plug that hole before we sink. -That kid rigged the boat.
Plug it up tighter! The water's getting in. We're going to-
-My Weezing! -Arbok and Lickitung are floating away.
We can use his Starmie and Staryu to bring them back.
Right. Good idea.
-Huh? What's this? -What's what?
-Ah. Oh, no. -That little twerp tricked us!
-But why would he do it? -Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd.
Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd. Farfetch'd...
Back off, birdbrain! Those are my Pokemon!
-And that's my Weezing. -
Come back here.
Give us back our Pokemon.
Far-far-far-far-far-far!
-Farfetch'd. -Hey, that's nice work, Farfetch'd.
Now they're mine. All mine.
And then he ran off.
I think he might have taken my backpack by accident.
-The Farfetch'd came and then did a trick. -Yeah.
-I'm sorry but that was no accident. -What do you mean by that?
This has happened before?
You're the fifth victim of the backpack-switching thief this week.
You were tricked by that boy and his Farfetch'd.
Jenny, you have to help me.
That thief and Farfetch'd stole every Pokemon I had.
I've been trying to track him down for a while but never he stays in one place.
-He's a slippery one, that kid. -
We've been together for a long time, Farfetch'd.
Right after I found you injured on the road and nursed you back to health,
-we started stealing. -Farfetch'd.
I wish there was some other way for us to get by,
but... how else are we ever going to survive?
-We're just too weak to battle. -Farfetch'd.
Psyduck. Psyduck.
Well, I think our stew is ready.
We're going to find that no-good, rotten crook and show him
what good rotten crooks are like.
I can't wait. And I can't believe he tricked us so easily.
-It's because you were so stupid. -Ah!
But Meowth was the one who fell for his trick in the first place.
Let's not fight. Let's save all our nastiness for that lousy kid.
This is it. This is the place I ran into him.
-Maybe he lives somewhere nearby. -Hmm.
Oh, I can't believe he stole all my Pokemon.
Staryu, Starmie, Goldeen and Horsea.
-Misty, you forgot Psyduck. -Oh, I wish I could forget Psyduck.
Psy. Psy. Psyduck.
-Look, it's Psyduck. - Huh?
Ah, I'm so happy to see you. I missed you so much.
-But how did you get back here? -Psyduck.
-Where's my backpack now? -Psyduck.
-What about the other Pokemon? -Psyduck.
-Where did he take you? -Psyduck.
-Well, then how did you get away? -Psyduck.
- Where's the guy who stole you? -Psyduck.
-And where's that Farfetch'd? -Psyduck.
Come on, you dumb duck! Start thinking straight!
-Ah, now you're giving me a headache! -Psyduck.
Okay, Psyduck, tell us which way to go. Left or right?
-Psyduck. -
What's wrong with you? Can't you remember anything?
-Hey, Misty, chill out. -Yeah, Misty, you've got to relax.
Psyduck's trying as hard as he can to remember where the others are.
-Psy-ay. -Huh? To the left?
-Are you sure about this? -Psy-ay.
-You better be! -Following directions from a Psyduck
-doesn't sound like a good idea. -Pikachu.
-We keep getting more Pokemon. -Farfetch'd.
Well, if we meet someone on the road, we'll just have to take their Pokemon too.
-Farfetch'd. Far. - There he is!
Huh?
-Hold it, buster. -You won't get away now.
-What are you doing here? -Fetch'd far.
You thought you were going to get away with it, didn't you?
Sinking that boat and grabbing our Pokemon.
Now we're going to make you pay for making fools of us.
Hey, come on, can't you guys take a joke? I meant what I said.
I really am sick of raising Pokemon. I've got so many.
Look, I'll give you Arbok and Weezing and Lickitung and we'll call it even.
Nice try.
You can't make it up by just giving them back.
- No, you're right. - Huh?
So I'll give you all of these and my apologies.
What? You mean all of these?
Don't worry about it. Go ahead and take them.
-Well, since he's being so generous. -We'll have to forgive him.
I'm glad I ran into you guys.
I was planning on moving anyway but I just had too much stuff to carry.
-Oh, lucky you. -Yeah.
So please forgive me and good luck.
- What a haul. -There's so many of them.
Well, it looks like the kid wasn't so bad after all.
Mm-hmm.
-Psy. -That's the kid.
Huh? -Good work, Psyduck. You found him.
You act like a quack most of the time but you're pretty smart, Psyduck.
Psy?
-Well, I guess we better get going. -Fetch'd far, far.
- Stop right there. -Ah!
Give me back my Pokemon right now, you thief.
-Pika, Pika. -Oh, no.
You're under arrest for grand theft Pokemon.
-You're crime spree is over. -Farfetch'd far.
What makes you think it was okay to lie and cheat people
so you could steal their Pokemon?
It takes a lot of love and care to raise Pokemon.
We worked real hard to train them all to win their Pokemon battles.
-That's right. -Maybe we should start off
by showing this kid just how difficult a Pokemon match is.
-Good idea. -Huh?
-That's right, a battle. -Wait a minute.
Farfetch'd is too weak. We had no other choice.
That's not true at all.
Pokemon will become stronger with trainers who work with them.
-But Farfetch'd isn't- -Fetch'd far, far.
-Huh? You mean you want to battle? -Far Farfetch'd.
-But Farfetch'd- -Good. Let's start our Pokemon battle.
-Bulbasaur. -Fetch'd. Far. Far.
-Wait, Farfetch'd. -Go for it, Bulbasaur! Tackle attack!
-Farfetch'd! -Farfetch'd, stop.
-Bulbasaur, vine whip attack. -Bulba.
Farfetch'd, no!
At least now you can see the right way to capture Pokemon in the wild.
-Farfetch'd -Please stop, Farfetch'd!
-You can't win this! -Farfetch'd! Farfetch'd! Farfetch'd!
-Farfetch'd! -Bulbasaur!
Farfetch'd! Farfetch'd!
-Huh? -What's that?
-It's Farfetch'd's agility. -Pika.
I didn't know Farfetch'd could do that.
-Bulbasaur, are you okay? -Pika?
I never thought Farfetch'd had attacks like that.
Huh? You really didn't know about its powers?
No. If I had known it was this strong, I wouldn't have used it to steal.
You can't judge a Pokemon by the way it looks.
-All right, Pikachu, your turn. -Pika.
-Pika, pika. -Hold it.
He robbed me, so it's my job to battle him.
I choose you, Staryu!
Oh, I forgot. I didn't get my Poke Balls back yet.
-Psyduch-si. -Far.
-Psyduck? -Psy?
Here's my chance.
Come on, Farfetch'd! Give Psyduck your best shot!
Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit...
Psy!
It's working. Psyduck's headache is getting worse.
-Just a little more. -Pikachu.
-Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit... -Psy!
-Hit... -Farfetch'd, no!
That's it! Psyduck's absolute migraine attack, disable.
-You did it, Psyduck! -Psyduck!
I'm embarrassed for ever doubting that kid.
Let's open up these Poke Balls
and find out what kind of great Pokemon he gave us.
-Voltorb. -All of them are Voltorb.
We'll get him for this.
I'm sorry! I won't do anything bad anymore!
Farfetch'd!
Forgive me. I'll give back all the Pokemon I stole.
None the victims are going to press charges
since they all got their Pokemon back.
- That's good. -It's great to have my old backpack back.
It was wrong to steal and it was wrong not to believe in Farfetch'd.
Fetch'd far, far.
Now I'm going to train Farfetch'd to become even stronger.
Great. That's the way it should be.
Now you see that Pokemon can be anything a good trainer wants it to be.
-Yeah. Thanks a lot. -Far Farfetch'd.
-See you. Let's go, Farfetch'd. -Farfetch'd.
-Good luck, you two. -Take care.
Misty might have lost her Pokemon for good,
but thanks to a little help from Psyduck.
Psy-ay.
Or rather, thanks to a lot of help from Psyduck.
Psy.
Her Pokemon were returned safely
and everyone learned an important lesson about honesty, bravery and trust.
Are you sure you want to tell the boss about this?
Team Rocket can't allow anyone to steal Pokemon. That's our job.
Right, James.
- Wrong. - Huh?
If we tell the boss how the kid outsmarted us,
he'll want to make him part of Team Rocket.
-Ah, and then... -He'll be in and we'll be out.
- Exactly. - Oh, no!
Then we'll just have to tell him...
Absolutely nothing about that kid or Farfetch'd.
- Okay? -Precisely. That's what we'll do.
-Voltorb. Voltorb. -Oh, no, there's one left.
Voltorb.
Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again!
