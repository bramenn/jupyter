Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
We Tremble in Awe of That Which Cannot Be Seen
And We Worship That Which Cannot Be Seen
Yes I sense a strong Sprit Energy
What's this?
You kick Yama down and now you tell us to get outta your way?!
Uhh
Say something, damn you!
Oh, Toshirin's
This is bad!
He's so unreasonable!
Shut up, will ya?!
Listen, all of you Look at that!
What can that be?
You, in the middle!
Huh? Uh, wellflowers for the kid who died here the other day?
Absolutely right!
Mit-chan!
Then tell me Why is that vase on its side?
Wellwe were skateboarding and knockeditover
If you ever do it again
I'll make it so someone will have to offer flowers for your souls, too!
S-Sorry about that!
Whew If I put that much fear into them they probably won't be back.
I'll bring you some fresh flowers tomorrow.
Thank you for getting rid of them. Now I should be able to rest in peace.
It's about time you passed over.
I'm Ichigo Kurosaki, 15, a tenth grader.
My family runs a medical clinic.
We save some, and we lose some.
Maybe it's because of that,
but ever since I can remember, I've been able to see ghosts.
I'm home
You're late!
You delinquent!
You know that dinnertime here is always at 7:00!
You! Is this any way to treat your son,
who just laid his life on the line to help a ghost pass over?!
Shut up! I don't care what your excuse is.
Anyone who disturbs the peace and happiness in this home will be punished!
Or what?
Are you gloating over the fact that only you can touch or talk to ghosts?!
Shut up! I didn't ask to be born like this!
Stop it, will you two? Dinner's getting cold.
Leave them alone, Yuzu. More rice please.
But, Karin
Anyway
Ordering a healthy male high school student to come home every night at 7:00 is
Ichigo, you have a new one on you.
Huh?
This guywhen did he get here?!
No matter how hard I try to get rid of them, they just won't go away!
Thanks for dinner.
Poor Ichigo He's so popular.
But I sort of envy him.
I can sense their presence, but I rarely see anything.
Well, I don't believe in ghosts and such.
What? But you see them too, don't you, Karin?
Dad's the only one who can't see them.
Whether I see them or not,
if I don't believe in them, they don't exist.
Ohh
So cold!
Dinner
Wide open!
Never mind! I'm going to bed.
Oh, Ichigo
It's your fault, Dad.
Why?!
Ichigo is having a tough time right now.
Now that you mention it,
he said he's seeing more of them than before.
What?!
You mean he talks to you about things like that?
He doesn't tell me
Of course not.
You're over 40, but can only communicate in this immature way.
Who'd want to tell you anything?
Dear I don't know if it's because they're in puberty,
but our daughters have been so cold towards me!
What should I do?
First of all, get rid of that stupid memorial poster.
The incident occurred
one block away from the main street outside of Karakura Station.
According to local residents, at about 7:30 AM,
the ground shook with a loud crash and
the walls of many buildings exploded.
Good morning, Ichigo.
'Morning Where's Dad?
He has a meeting. He won't be home tonight.
I see Huh?
Investigators and explosives experts are currently working to discover the cause.
What's wrong?
That's near here.
Hey!
Hm?
What was that sound?
I didn't hear anything
It's another explosion!
W-What's that?
Help me!
Run!
What is it?!
I don't know!
Oh. Hey! Hurry!
H-Hey
Hey, you?
What was that, anyway?
Another explosion?
What's going on?
I can't figure it out
Who was that?
Whoare you?
Who are you?! What do you want?
Hey!
It's near
What are you talking about?!
First you scare the living daylights out of me, then you ignore me?
I'm asking you who you are!
Y-You You can see me?
But waityou just kicked me...
Huh? What are you babbling about?
Of course, I can see you.
You were the one in town earlier, weren't you?
You just noticed?
Strange People usually can't see me
Quit talking nonsense
Why, you!
Then, I will tell you.
I ama Soul Reaper.
Again Where?
I see. So you're a Soul Reaper.
And you've come all the way here from this Soul Society place
in order to exorcise evil demons.
So that means that that monster was a demon
and it attacked that girl.
Okay, I'll believe you
Idiot! You think I'd believe that?!
You're...You're saying that, although you see ghosts,
you don't believe in Soul Reapers?
Of course!
Unfortunately, I've never seen a Soul Reaper before.
I don't believe in anything that I can't see.
But you're seeing me now.
I'll admit that you're no human.
But quit playing Soul Reaper around here.
Got that? You pipsqueak.
You dare to call me that?!
Bakudo Number One: Sai!
Ouch! What did you do to me?!
You can't move, can you?
This is Kido, a high-level incantation that only a Soul Reaper can use.
I may not look it, but I have lived nearly ten times longer than you.
And you called me a pipsqueak?!
In any other situation, I would kill you on the spot,
but I am not permitted to execute anyone not named in my orders.
Be grateful for that, pipsqueak.
Of all the nerve!
And so
Oh
Y-You're the guy from yesterday
N-No I don't want to go to the Netherworld!
Fear not. Your destination is not the Netherworld.
It is the Soul Society.
Unlike the Netherworld, it is a restful place.
What happenedto that guy?
I sent him to the Soul Society.
In your language it's called passing over, I guess.
It's one of the jobs of Soul Reapers.
I will explain it simply so that even an impatient brat like you can be satisfied.
Now listen
There are two types of spirits in this world.
The first are normal spirits called Wholes
They're the ghosts you usually see.
The second are called Hollows.
They attack people, living or dead, to devour their souls.
They are evil spirits.
Do you have any questions so far?
WellTell me why your drawing is so bad, why don't you?
Hey!
What the hell did you do?!
I will continue my explanation, Baron.
Baron?
We Soul Reapers have two jobs.
The first is to lead the Wholes to the Soul Society
with a sendoff, Konso, as I just did.
And the second is to cut and purify the Hollows.
Why was that Hollow going after that girl?
That I do not know.
We have yet to grasp everything about them.
I smell it
It's the smell of an especially tasty soul.
It's nearby along with the smell of a Soul Reaper.
Oh! What was that?!
Whatever the case,
there's another one wandering around here.
Then, hurry up and get rid of it!
No, well
For some reason, I haven't been able to sense its presence at all.
It's as though some strong force is obstructing my senses.
What are you saying?! Can't you hear the terrible cries?!
Isn't that the Hollow you're after?
Terrible cries? I don't
I heard that!
That is definitely the cry of a Hollow!
See?!
Yuzu!
Hey, wait!
What strong spirit pressure! How could I not have sensed this?!
I!
Ichigo
Yuzu!
Karin was
Ichigo
Please saveKarin
Hey, you!
Hey!
Damn it!
Stop it! Stopit!
Stay back!
Karin!
Damn it!
He's moving after I put that spell on him!
You'll get in the way! Stay back!
Shut up!
Karin!
Stop that! No human strength can break it.
If you try to force it, your soul will
A human breaking the spell under his own power?
Wait!
Ichigo! Run!
Karin!
I found you.
Karin! Hey!
Get a hold of yourself!
That Hollow has not devoured your sisters' souls yet.
Are you sure?
Yes
It is seeking a soul with a higher concentration of spirit energy.
I see. That Hollow this afternoon wasn't after that girl, either.
What do you mean?
For some reason,
your spirit energy was almost completely suppressed until just now.
That's why I didn't sense anything about you,
and you were never attacked by a Hollow.
It's just conjecture,
but perhaps the spirit energy that was sealed up within your body
began to pour out due to the contact you had
with the ghost of that young girl.
In other words,
those two Hollows sensed the density of your soul through that girl.
They are really after you!
They'reafter me
It's here! You stay
Shut up!
Are you saying that girl was attacked because of me?
What are you talking about?
It's my fault that Karin and Yuzu's lives are in danger?!
Please save
Ichigo Run!
Hey!
You! You want my soul, don't you?
In that case, come fight me one on one!
Soul Reaper!
You fool!
You should have known that you were no match for him!
Or, did you think that everything would be over
if you gave him your soul?
At this rate, we will all simply become food for him.
Do you wantto save your family?
Of course! Is there a way?
There's just one way
You must become a Soul Reaper!
What?!
Run the point of this Zanpakuto through the center of your being
and I will pour my powers into you.
I don't know if it will work, but there is nothing else we can do.
Give me that sword, Soul Reaper.
My name is not Soul Reaper. I am Rukia Kuchiki.
I am
Ichigo Kurosaki!
How could it be?
I meant to give him half of my energy, but he took it all
Hey!
Who is he?!
I have never seen a human with spirit energy enough
to confuse a Soul Reaper.
I have never seen a human with strength enough
to break a spell on his own
AndI've never seen a Soul Reaper's Zanpakuto
become so large!
Now you'll pay for hurting my family!
You fish-face!
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Hey, how are you all doing?
This is your idol Kon, who was voted
the one you'd most want to make your bride in the world of Bleach!
It's finally started
The high school Soul Reaper's sweet but painful, slightly salty, heartfelt
No! You don't appear until later in the story!
Oh, we're out of time
