Ichika Nino Miku Yotsuba Itsuki
I can't believe they all bombed nearly every subject.
I know we didn't have much time, but they studied a lot.
Futaro!
You need to stop talking about studying at home.
What kind of education approach is that?!
And you were the one who hooked me up with this job!
You weren't a very good student in the past either, remember?
You don't need to worry so much. Itsuki-chan and the rest will change.
What? Onii-chan wasn't such a study freak in the past?
This kid was a wild boy, just like me.
I know you have a photo from back then in your student handbook.
Let me see!
No.
Hell no.
Yoink.
Hey, Dad!
Let me see! Let me see!
Take a look.
No way.
This is Onii-chan?
Wow!
That was around when you met that girl and became how you are now.
I-I don't know what you're talking about.
Hey, hey, is that your first love?
No, she's not.

What are these?
Croquettes.
Are you sure they aren't rocks?
I'm confident they taste good, though.
Try them.
Okay, then.
You made ohagi?
Thanks.
Oh, it's a croquette. It's actually pretty good.
It's not that good!
Wow, you have surprisingly picky taste, Yotsuba.
Your tastes are just too easy to cater to! And you're a hater, too!
Which is it?
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hater or whatever.
Let's just start reviewing the exams.
Wait.
I'm going to keep making them until they taste perfect.
So eat.
How's your stomach feeling?
Miku will be back with some medicine soon.
I was supposed to be tutoring today.
I messed up.
I never thought she'd feed me until I collapsed.
I'm stuffed, too.
It's all because you wouldn't stop complaining!
I really thought they were good, but you could have told a white lie!
If I lied, Miku would see right through it.
You could have just told her that you like the flavor.
I like the flavor!
I see! Today I learned!
That's not what I came here to teach you.
What's this?
Taking a nap in someone else's home?
Did someone drug you or something?
Ironically, I would like some drugs today.
Not that I care.
Let's go, Itsuki. Lunchtime's going to end.
O-Okay.
Shoot!
Yotsuba!
Yes? What is it?
I want those two to start studying.
Make them stay!
How do I do that?
Lie to them if you have to.
All right.
Oh yeah, there's a place at the station...
Wait, you two!
As you can see, Uesugi-san has been struck by a grave illness!
Take care of him!
A grave illness?
Yotsuba... Come on...
You're such a terrible liar!
Then maybe he should go to the hospital.
I-I don't think he can.
Apparently, he'll die if he moves!
What kind of weird illness is that?
What the hell?
Let's go, Itsuki.
Okay.
Shit, I just moved a bit, and I nearly died.
What are you doing?
Stay still.
Well, just take your medication, get some sleep, and you'll be okay.
Look, Nino, you can have these croquettes for lunch.
How are those croquettes?
You're...
I know!
You're good at cooking, aren't you?
You should make him some porridge.
I'm sick because I overate.
You haven't forgotten that, have you?
I guess that's not too much to ask for.
Why pick now to start being nice?!
You're okay with eggs in, right?
Yeah, thanks.
I didn't know you were so ill.
Yotsuba, is there anything I can do?
Um...
Um...
Why don't you hold his hand or something?
Remember how Mom used to do that for us when we were bedridden?
She said it's a magic spell to make you feel better.
No way!
The two situations couldn't be more different!
Stop talking already, Yotsuba.
Are you okay?
If it'll help you get better...
What?
I can't!
You must really hate me, huh?
All right, we've managed to keep them here, but now what?
You guys should get along better.
Study with us, Itsuki.
Let's take Uesugi-san's lessons together from now on.
It'll be a lot more fun with the five of us.
I think I took the wrong approach.
This suits Yotsuba a lot more than having her tell lies.
I'll think about it.
Here you are.
I made porridge.
Hey, whole rice.
Every single grain is sparkling.
They must use really good rice.
That burns!
S-Sorry, are you okay?
Wait, huh? He's moving around.
Looks like I'm all better now.
And now it's just the two of us again.
We're back to where we were before the exams.
Are we?
Haven't you noticed?
Nino didn't try to kick you out of our apartment.
It's just a coincidence.
It's not just Nino and Itsuki, either.
Ichika and Miku are changing, too. Even I can tell.
I'm the only one that hasn't grown.
My exam results still suck, too.
That's not true.
You were the first one to change.
I'm lucky one of you was honest and straightforward.
Maybe I'm giving you too much credit.
Especially given I got wrecked today because you're too straightforward to lie.
Do you know why I'm on your side?
Say what?
Because you want better grades, right?
No.
Because I like you.
Huh?
Wait...
What?
Just kidding.
I can lie when I wanna, too!
I won't trust anyone anymore.
And so Futaro's heart grew a little colder.
School camp! School camp! School camp!
Uesugi-san! School camp is coming up!
Yotsuba?
It's me.
Uesugi-san.
Who are you?!
It's me.
Thank goodness.
Who are you?!
It's me.
Help me!
Quiet in the library.
Sorry.
What are you doing with all these costume masks?
He's on the test of courage planning committee.
That's a surprisingly social thing for you to do.
I'm not doing it by choice.

Campfire
My class is in charge of the test of courage,
and my classmates dumped it on my head while I was busy studying by myself.
Poor thing.
He deserved it.
I'm going to get back at them by scaring the crap out of them.
I'll make it a night they won't forget.
You're totally into it.
It's not right that they're making him do it all on his own, though.
I'm gonna go complain to Class 1.
Don't bother.
Miku's right.
I deserved it.
But...
Besides, I don't even care about camp.
Then, let's talk about things that could make you look forward to it.
I heard this from my friends in class.
Did you know there's a legend about our school camp?
There's always a campfire dance on the last day,
and any pairs dancing when it ends are destined to spend their lives together.
That's unrealistic. And silly.
You're too cynical! Kids these days!
It's a campfire!
A legend of fate!
Don't you think it's romantic?
Come on, let's start studying.
Yoohoo.
Ichika, you're late.
What are you wearing?
That's not important. We're doing math today.
Sorry.
I have a shoot today.
That got me thinking...
I should let you know ahead of time whenever this happens.
So here. Let's exchange email addresses.
Email addresses, huh?
Do we really need to?
I agree! We should exchange email addresses!
I'd like to join in too, Uesugi-san.
Oh, but before that,

Okay, done.
Yotsuba.
Should I even ask what you're doing?
Making a thousand paper cranes.
My friend's friend is in the hospital.
Study!
Give me half of that.
We're studying once we're done with this.
Okay.
Oh, Nakano.
Sensei.
I'm glad I found you here.
Could you put these on everyone's desks?
Sure.
How much of a pushover are you?!
Hold on, is she buying time so she doesn't have to study?
If she is, she's way more wicked than Nino.
Okay, I'm off.
Good luck.
Go, Ichika!

Your cute sleepy face
If you don't want me to send it around, you'll get the other four's email addresses!
If you don't want me to send it around, you'll get the other four's email addresses!
Man, as your tutor,
I should probably get everyone's email addresses, huh?
I'll help you.
Yay.
I did it.
I guess I can get Itsuki's and Nino's some other day.
I saw them in the cafeteria.
Okay, let's go!
H-Hey, what about your address?
Thanks.
I saved my address.
Okay.
Wait up, Yotsuba!
Absolutely not.
Ab-so-lute-ly not.
There's no reason for us to want your email address.
The Theater Club Needs You!
I expected you to say that.
But wait, there's more!
Uesugi Raiha Dad Nakano Ichika
Act now, and I'll throw in Raiha's email address for free!

It's a bargain!
Itsuki-chan!
You leave me no choice.
That's so cowardly, selling your family out like that!
Say what you will.
Aren't you telling me yours, Nino?
Of course not.
All right, then.
In that case, we'll chat without you.
The rest of us, without you.
G-Give me something to write with.
Here.
Now you've got everyone's.
There's one more.
Ichika, Miku, Itsuki, Nino...
Yotsuba! That's me!
Yeah, she's plain stupid.
This is my email address.
Basketball Club Captain
Incoming Call
You have a call.
The basketball club?
Wait, are you still hanging out with them?
Oh, right, I had one more thing I had to do for someone.
Okay, Uesugi-san. I'll be leaving now.
You're such a bad liar.
Hey!
I wrote my email address.
Hey, everyone.
Nakano-san. Thanks for the help the other day.
Don't mention it.
I knew it.
The fact that she lied to come here even though she sucks at it means...
So, Nakano-san, have you thought about joining the club?
Yes.
I'm thankful that you invited me.
So that's what it is?!
Yotsuba really was buying time to avoid studying!
That's great.
Then...
But...
I'm sorry.
I'll have to decline.
I'm well aware that the basketball club needs my help,
but I have an important engagement after school.
O-Of course, I can always fill in at games.
I see.
Guess that's that, then.
Although I think it's a waste of talent not to join us.
There's someone who's spurring me on, even though I have no talent.
Basketball Club Looking for members!
U-Uesugi-san?
Why are you here?
I was on my way to the library.
But the library and this club wing are in completely opposite directions.
Weird.
Are you done here?
I'm going to keep working you hard. You'd best be ready.
Yes, sir.
I'm ready now.
Thanks, Raiha.
Sure.
Oh, right.
Uesugi Raiha Dad Nakano Ichika Nakano Miku Nakano Yotsuba Nakano Itsuki
I guess I should message them about the weekend session.

Huh?
Where's Nino's?
My student handbook!
I didn't get it back from Nino!
Give me back my student handbook.
Eek!
Unbelievable.
How could you enter a girl's room without permission first thing in the morning?!
I allowed it.
And what gives you the right to do that?!
I apologize.
I just wanted my student handbook back as soon as possible.
You're being awfully meek.
Is there something you're hiding in here?
There's no telling what she'll say if she sees my old photo.
Morning, Futaro-kun.
Here, Nino.
It's what we were talking about yesterday.
Can you really do it by yourself?
I-I said I'll be fine!
Don't underestimate me.
Honestly, any other time, I'd rather die than let you in my room.
What?
Hurry up and give me my handbook.
I'll give it back if you pierce my ears.
What?
You want it back, don't you?
Do it.
Uh, do it yourself.
I don't wanna. It's scary.
Then why do you want piercings at all?
Just so you know, it's going to hurt for a while.
What would you know? You've never done it before.
I-I guess.
No reason, really.
I just want it because everyone else is doing it.
I see.
Fine.
This is a perfect opportunity to get back at you for everything.
Here I go.
The handbook.
Five...
Four...

Zero!
Quit messing around!
Shit!
Wait, this bad boy...
He's totally my type!
Who is it?
It's me!
A-A relative.
I didn't want you to see that.
He's a lot hotter than you.
Hook me up someday.
Sure.
Someday.
Oh, yeah.
We used to be adorable little angels back then, too.
See?
Look.
No interest?
I think I'll show the girls for old times' sake.
Thank goodness.
Nino.
Are you done?
I thought it over, and there's no reason to rush into it.
As long as I can do it by the time I'm wearing my wedding dress.
Never mind that.
Look at this picture.
It's the five of us.
She saw my photo,
but good thing she only saw half of it.
We're all so cute.
When was this again?
Sixth grade.
This was Kyoto, which means...
It's from our school trip.
Five years ago, huh?
The color's fading a bit.
This really takes me back.
We've changed a lot, huh?
I hope I meet her again.
Next Time on The Quintessential Quintuplets
Quintuplet Trivia!
Yotsuba is really athletic.
But can she memorize the rules?
Of course I can.
Then what are the rules for basketball?
Put the ball in the basket, and you get two or three points!
That's it?
Also, you tend to eat on the way home often.
That's just an after-practice trope!
