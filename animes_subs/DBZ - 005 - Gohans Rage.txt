W- what is this!?
I- it's Son Goku's boy...
I- impossible!
G- Gohan!
R- run, Gohan!
Run away!
B- Battle power...
O- one thousand... one thousand three hundred seven!?
Stop picking on...
G- Gohan?
Father?
Did you-?
Father...
Y- you little brat!
R- run!
Gohan, run away!
Run away! Quickly!
N- now his battle power is a mere 1?
It changed suddenly, along with his emotions.
Father...
Run!
Gohan!
Gohan!
S- stop! Please stop! He's-
-still just a child? Is that what you were going to say?
You've got to be joking! That brat has a battle power far higher than you two!
I'm going to kill him now,
while he's still incapable of adeptly using his power.
Don't worry. You'll see him again soon enough!
In the Other World, that is.
Wait!
You're the first one who has inflicted this much damage on me.
But this is the end of the line for you.
W- why, you!
You still have this much power left!?
Piccolo!
Hurry! Do that technique from earlier!
I've been getting it ready, just in case!
But it's still going to take... a little bit more time!
Why didn't you grab his tail!?
If he decided to, he could cut off his tail on his own!
Y- you knew about that?
Piccolo! Hurry!
Hurry it up, please!
Damn! Thanks to the blow that kid landed on me... my power has dropped!
L- let me go, Kakarrot! You idiot!
You're going to get it too, clinging to me like this!
I'm going to die together with you!
Y- you're what!?
Are you out of your mind!?
This is the only way there is to defeat you!
Son Goku!
I'm not going to hesitate here.
If I can wipe you out as well, nothing could be better for me!
But then again,
your friends will probably just bring you back to life with the Dragon Balls.
Piccolo... still not yet? My ribs are broken!
H- hurry!
O- one thousand four hundred eighty-five!?
L- let me go! I was in the wrong! I- I'll never come to this planet again!
Y- you think you can fool me again?
It's no lie! Don't you believe the word of your own older brother!?
Piccolo! Hurry and do it!
Sorry to keep you waiting. Are you ready for this!?
Do it!!
W- wait!
Makankosappo!!
Stop!!
D- damn it to hell!
Damn... To think that I... would be done in... by these guys!
T- take that!
W- who would have thought... that Kakarrot...
You idiot...
Son Goku can come back to life right away.
W- what!?
We have these nice things called Dragon Balls here on this planet.
By asking of them, any desire one may have can become possible.
Bringing the dead back to life, for example.
Damn it all...
Still, you've told me something good...
The entire situation up until now...
has been communicated to m- my two pals, deep in space.
What?
They know that I've been done in...
And while they're at it...
maybe they'll use those whatever-you-called-them things...
and have me brought back to life.
T- those...
One year... just one year from now...
One year? Two more of you... who are even stronger?
Your chances of winning will be absolutely zero that time for sure...
Enjoy yourselves as much as you can for the next year...
It was a short-lived joy, wasn't it?
You guys are no more than worms, after all...
Right now, Goku-sa and the others must be havin' a good time at the Kame House.
l wonder if Gohan is adjustin' okay to them...
Still, he'll be okay.
That boy's got good manners.
I wish I had gone, too...
Gohan- chan!
Chichi, where's Gohan- chan?
Hey, Gohan- chan!
I brung you a whole mess of presents-!
I think it was around here somewhere.
You're out of your misery now.
You just had to go and spit out all of that uncalled-for blather.
Son Goku, he's dead.
There's somebody there!
Some of them are down!
T- the only one standing is...
W- what the hell?
At that same time, a great distance away in space...
That miserable Raditz...
He's dead.
He's pathetic! I mean, really...
with a battle power of just a bit more than a thousand!
What should we do? Put this planet on hold and go there?
They mentioned something... interesting, didn't they?
Dragon... balls, or something.
Yeah. It sounds like they can grant any wish.
All right then, let's go.
We're going to bring Raditz back to life, right?
Don't make jokes! We don't need that good-for-nothing any more.
We won't ever grow any older,
but instead have eternal youth. How does that sound?
If that were so, we could enjoy fighting forever!
I get you. That would be great!
That's how it happened.
I- I see...
Goku! Goku, I say!
Hey, Goku! Stay with us!
Gohan- kun is fine. He's just unconscious.
Thank...
He's coming around.
Goku...
Chichi won't... chew me out...
Son- kun...
K- uririn...
Y- you might say that.
W- what are you saying, Goku!? D- don't give up!
This isn't like you!
Goku!
T- this time... it doesn't look... so good for me...
D- don't worry! We'll bring you back to life right away!
I'm... counting... on it...
Goku...
Goku!!
Goku!!
Everything else aside, Kakarrot's son's battle power...
It could have been some kind of mistake, couldn't it?
No, there's no mistake.
Raditz did actually take a great deal of damage from that kid's strike.
Apparently, when our blood is mixed with an Earthling's,
it results in a hybrid with mighty power.
Hmph, a Super Saiyan, you mean?
I get it. If we were to produce those guys one after another,
then once again, Saiyan rule will no longer be a dream.
You've got to be kidding.
Just watch those guys grow and gain even greater power for themselves.
Then it will be our positions that are in danger.
That would be true.
In any case,
we will exterminate everyone on Earth.
Three days should be enough for that.
Until then, let's have ourselves a good, long sleep for the first time in a while.
Yeah! I'll look forward to seeing you in a year!
Goku!
Goku!
Goku...
Son- kun! I can't stand you dying!
Goku!
He vanished!
I get it. This is Kami's doing.
This is something he would be capable of.
That bastard.
He's thinking of using Son Goku again for some nonsense or other.
Some nonsense?
How does Kami-sama intend to use Son Goku?
Now that Goku is no longer here to rely on,
is there any means left of defending the Earth?
The mighty Saiyans arrive on Earth in one year!
