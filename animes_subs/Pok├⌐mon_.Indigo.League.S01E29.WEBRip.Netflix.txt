Our friends journey leads them to a desolate factory town,
known as Gringey City.
It's a depressing place where few people live
and even the ocean winds smell like sludge.
Here, their next adventure begins.
This is a really weird city. Lots of factories but no people.
-This place is called Gringey City. -Gringey?
Never heard of it.
It used to be a lively, busy place with all these factories here.
Yeah, they kind of went overboard with factories.
Pollution ruined the air and the water here.
I guess we won't find any Pokemon here.
Pika.
Pikachu, what's wrong?
Pika.
Pikachu!
Sparks Fly for Magnemite
Hold on, Pikachu.
We'll get you to the Pokemon Center as soon as we can.
Pika.
That's them, and they're on their way to the Pokemon Center.
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
I can't take it anymore!
-This is disgusting! -This place stinks!
Just chill out and put on the suits I brought you.
This thing pumps in a mixture of oxygen and air freshener.
That smells good.
Why didn't you tell us about these suits before, Meowth?
We could have choked.
Quit complaining. I did come up with this ingenious scheme.
Now get in the pipe and swim to the Pokemon Center.
We're wasting time here.
Your plan's stupid. I'm not going in that sewer.
I'm 100 percent with Jessie on this one.
I want to get Pikachu just as much as you do,
but this is humiliating.
-It's degrading. -We won't go through with this, Meowth,
so you'll have to go on this mission alone. I'm sorry if this shocks you.
So am I.
I knew you'd see things my way.
You'll pay for this, Meowth.
Why do we always get the dirty work?
Hey, nurse!
Hey, nurse!
Do you kids have any idea just what time it is?
Don't you know that you should be sleeping now?
I'm sorry, but there's something really wrong with my Pikachu.
A cold.
This is no cold.
Your sisters and cousins were a lot more helpful!
There's no need to get excited.
Look, sparks are coming from its cheeks, right?
That's an early symptom of a cold in electric rodent Pokemon.
If you leave it here overnight, I'm sure it'll be fine in the morning.
-Miss. -Hmm?
Excuse me, but are you, by any chance, the oddball in your family?
Oh, no. It's all my other relatives that are odd.
Huh?
Grimer, Grimer, Grimer...
Huh? What's that?
Our generator's completely shut down.
-The water intake valve is totally jammed. -It can't be!
Hey, what's going on? The power supply just went dead.
If the pump stops working, there's no air.
They won't like that.
My air supply.
-Oh. -
-What happened to these Pokemon? - They're in intensive care.
If we don't get the power back soon,
well, I just don't want to think about what would happen.
Don't just stand there. We have to save them.
-Joy, please do something. -I don't know what to do.
Hey, stop giving Joy a hard time. There's nothing that she can do.
-Let's go. -
Pikachu!
Pikachu, we'll be back when the power's back on.
Good luck, everybody.
Chu.
I'm trying to find out, but there's no answer at the power plant.
-We don't have much time. -What does the power plant look like?
You can't miss it.
It's the big building with the smokestacks there.
All right, let's go.
- -Huh?
Pi... Pikachu.
Pikachu.
Ah, Pikachu, you should be back at the Pokemon Center.
Chu.
-I don't get it. -Just think about it, Ash.
Pikachu's afraid we'll leave, and we won't come back.
Pika.
-See? -Hmm...
Okay, you can come along.
But remember, you've got to take it easy.
Pikachu!
We could have suffocated.
The city has been plunged into darkness by a power failure.
A power failure is it?
I can identify with failure.
Huh? There they go. Now we're in luck.
We got another chance.
For what?
For finally once and for all capturing that pesky Pikachu.
Come on now!
Jessie, James, let's move it!
Give us time to rest, Meowth.
We nearly drowned in the stinking sewer thanks to your ridiculous plan.
Meowth, you nearly killed us, you dimwit.
Guys, don't worry.
This time we've got a secret weapon that's Meowth-proof.
-There's the power plant. -Let's check inside.
Hello? Is anybody in here?
If no one's here, we might as well look around, huh?
Pikachu.
Something's really weird. Why isn't anybody working here?
It looks like the central control room's down that way.
Something's following us.
- -Huh?
The place is deserted. Nobody's here.
Oh, I know I heard something back there.
Listen, Misty, it's okay if you're a total chicken.
Brock and I are brave enough to handle things here.
I'm not a chicken, you little twerp!
There was something back there whether you believe me or not.
Okay, okay, let's just...
Huh?
Chill out?
There's something...
Right behind you.
All right, if anybody's there, you can come on out.
And if you're a ghost or a monster,
you can stay where you are, and we won't bother you.
And you called me chicken!
You're a total coward!
Maybe not a total coward.
- You're just a- - Come on, guys, quit it.
Pika!
Be quiet, Pikachu.
Be quiet.
Pika, pi-pika!
-Pikachu, I told you. -Pika! Pika!
- -Pika! Pika.
What is that thing?
What is that thing? What is it?
Magnemite.
Magnemite? Is that a Pokemon?
Magnemite, a magnet Pokemon.
Its means of floating through the air are not understood.
This very mysterious Pokemon is of the electric type.
What's a Pokemon like that doing here?
It caused the blackout. Magnemite shut down the power plant.
This one, by itself? No way.
Well, Dexter said it's mysterious.
Great. I'll capture it, then we can check it out.
Wait a minute. That Magnemite doesn't look like it wants to battle.
Cha.
What's with this thing? Why is it circling Pikachu?
It seems to like Pikachu.
-Pika. -Magnemite.
This Magnemite is blushing, like it's in love or something.
Love?
If it were an animal Pokemon, I could understand,
but how can an inorganic Pokemon, like Magnemite,
fall in love with an electric rodent?
Magnemite's following Pikachu all over the place,
almost like it's a streaker or something.
Ash, you mean a stalker.
Like I said, this Magnemite really likes Pikachu.
Yeah, but Pikachu doesn't like it.
Hey you, Magnemite, cut it out.
Pika.
- - Guess Magnemite gave up.
Mm, do you smell that?
-I do. -So do I.
-Grimer! -Grimer!
-It's those things. -They stinks.
What are they?
Grimer, a sludge Pokemon.
Born from sludge, these Pokemon specialize in sludge attacks.
Magnemite must have disappeared because of these things.
Is this what sludge smells like? It really stinks.
-Grimer! -
Ash, don't say anything that might insult their Pokemon pride or make them mad.
I'm sorry. You have such a unique scent.
I should have known it was the aroma of sludge.
You can call it whatever you want, but it sinks.
Shut up, Misty!
-Ah, it's huge! -Grimer's grandpa?
Muk, Grimer's evolved form.
Use extreme caution as its slimy form contains poison.
-That's not good news. -The smell is getting worse.
-Pika. -Muk.
Why'd you have to open your mouth and make the Grimer mad, Misty?
I had to open my mouth. I couldn't use my nose.
Cha!
What are you doing here?
I'm Brock, this is Misty, and we're here to help fix-
Uh, skip the introductions. We've got to get out of here.
-Grimer. Grimer. Grimer. -Pika!
Aah, the Grimer are here too!
-Back to the control room! -
Hey, wait for us!
Tell us what's going on. This blackout is a disaster for the city.
Lots of Pokemon are going to die at the Pokemon Center
if the power doesn't come back soon.
Hang in there.
Those kids are going to get the power back on real soon, I'm sure.
At least, I hope so.
-They need that power. -But we can't.
Grimer, Grimer...
There are so many Grimer that they're clogging the sea water intake.
We've got to bring the water to a boil, so it will turn the turbines
or the generator won't work at all.
So do something.
I'm afraid that's easy to say. We've been trying to do-
- Ash! - Huh?
The Grimer are ramming the door. I can't hold it!
I hate to say it, but if we don't act fast,
we'll be on the Muk menu.
But what can we do?
Grimer! Grimer! Grimer!
You three are all Pokemon trainers, aren't you?
You've got to use your Pokemon to help us out.
That's right. If you can get rid of the Grimer, the generator will work.
What do you expect us to do? Pikachu is sick.
It won't be able take on all of those Grimer at once.
Pika.
Pikachu, you're the only one who can help.
Kachu!
You- You're our last chance.
Give them your thunder shock!
Kachu!
Grimer! Grimer! Grimer!
It's no good. There are too many of them.
Muk!
What are they?
Magnemite and their evolved form, Magneton.
They're friends of our stalker.
Grimer! Grimer! Grimer!
-Yeah! -Yay!
The lights are on.
The turbine's moving again.
The Grimer have all cleared away from the sea water intake valve.
Yes!
Hold on. There's still one left.
Muk!
An adult Muk and its child.
Pikachu, thunder shock.
Pikachu!
Oh, man, that's some pretty strong sludge.
Magnemite.
Muk!
Chu!
Muk!
All right! Poke Ball, go!
I did it! I captured a Muk!
Ash Ketchum saves the day once again!
- -Hmm? What's wrong?
The smell comes through the Poke Ball!
That's the bad news.
But the good news is Pikachu's 100 better.
That's right. Pikachu was sick until just a little while ago.
Ah, if an electric mouse builds up too much electricity,
its body becomes magnetized nd it seems like it has a cold.
Pikachu.
Well, we all sure owe a big thank you to Magnemite here, don't we?
Pi! Pikachu!
Pi? Pika?
Hey, until just a minute ago, that Magnemite was obsessed with Pikachu.
What's going on? Now it's completely ignoring Pikachu.
Maybe Magnemite fall in and out of love just like humans do.
Hmm. Could Magnemite have fallen in love at first sight
because Pikachu's body was magnetized?
That must be the reason.
Animals are attracted to other animals by scent,
so Magnemite are attracted to other Pokemon by their magnetic force.
Because Pikachu had built up so much magnetic force,
it must have been very attractive to that Magnemite.
-Oh. -I get it.
After Pikachu ran out of electricity, it was no longer magnetized,
that's why Magnemite isn't interested in Pikachu anymore.
It's a good thing, huh, Pikachu? It won't follow you around anymore.
Chu!
- -Yeah.
We got them now.
Now the fun begins with our new secret weapon.
Tell them, James.
Now that Pikachu is magnetized,
our plan is to take this high-powered electromagnet and...
Finally capture Pikachu!
Hey, who are you talking to?
Let's just catch Pikachu.
Why don't you keep your snide remarks to yourself?
That's right.
-That sounds strange. -Certainly does.
Yeah.
Team Rocket's splashing off again!
All those Grimer here just prove that the ocean's totally polluted.
You guys got to clean up the sea around here.
-I know you can do it. -You're right, Misty.
We'll do everything we can to make sure that the ocean is really clean again.
If you clean up the air and the water,
you may just bring this place back to life.
Thanks, Ash.
You worked so hard to make sure all these Pokemon survived,
you've inspired me to become a better nurse.
We salute your fine work.
Oh, please, ladies. That's very nice of you.
Anyway, try to make your city clean.
We will and please come back and visit us.
Bye.
Our heroes leave Gringey City with big smiles
and even bigger hopes for a future that's cleaner and greener than before.
Meanwhile...
It's been quite a while since Ash sent me a new Pokemon.
I wonder what he's captured this time?
Ugh! What is this smell?
-M-m-m-muk! -
What's the idea of sending me a Muk?
Yuck!
Muk!
