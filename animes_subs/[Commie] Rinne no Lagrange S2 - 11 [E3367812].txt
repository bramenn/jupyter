No, don't...
Lan, Muginami...
I can't...
This is already my seventh bowl.
It's a new record for me.
Huh?!
My Oraga Bowl?
Huh?
Let's see...
Where'd you go?!
Stop hiding and come out, Lan's brother!
I still have a ton of things to say to you!
Where the hell...
am I?
Hey! Lan! Muginami!
Huh?!

The designated emergency evacuation location for this area
is Kamogawa Girls' High School!
Keep moving and make your way over there quickly!
There's broken glass inside the building.
Stay away from windows!
Get inside quickly!
Ms. Machiko...
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be okay.
Still no signs of Aura, Lympha or Ignis!
We have no line with any of the pilots!
I don't care, keep trying to contact them!
Don't overlook even the weakest signal!
Pharos to Aura, Lympha, Ignis. Do you read?
Respond, Madoka!
Lan! Muginami! Can you hear me?!
Please respond!
More regions are reporting abnormal phenomena!
Asia! Oceania! Europe! And now we're getting reports
from Africa and North, Central, and South America, as well!
This thing really is trying to swallow the entire Earth.
Just like it did 20,000 years ago...
What's going to happen?
Many ancient ruins foretell the end of the world.
Predictions of the world being consumed by fire,
or the coming of an evil devil that preys on humans.
You mean?
At any rate, we'll have our answer soon.
This looks like the place where I met Yurikano before.
But it's different.
It wasn't icy and cold like this.
It didn't feel this intense either.
I wonder if Lan and Muginami are here too?
Where could they be?
Madoka! Where are you?
Muginami! Can you hear me?
I can't even contact Pharos.
Where am I?
Madoka?
Hey!
Can anyone hear me?!
Lan!
Muginami!
Oh, so you were here...
Lan's brother!
Hey! Why'd you do such a terrible thing to Big Brother Giuvi?
No, not just him.
You betrayed all of us.
Everyone who believed in you that day...
Lan, Muginami, the people of the Polyhedron...
Yurikano...
And me, too!
Say something!
Midori!
I'm really mad now!
Tell me...
Why did things turn out like this?
Where did we go wrong?
Stop that...
Let me sleep.
You made a vow to us!
You agreed to join hands with Big Brother Giuvi once more!
We were all happy when you said that, so why?
Even if you are my brother...
No, it's because you're my brother.
I must stop you... As your sister!
Anyone who hurts Lan, or makes Madoka suffer...
will answer to me!
I won't forgive you.
I'll never, ever, ever... forgive you!
That perfect I gave you...
I take it back now!
Captain! On the antenna tower!
It's almost here...
I can feel it...
the tingling...
Why?
Why can't I beat him?!
I don't deserve a perfect... if I can't beat him!
W-What?!
Damn it! It's going to engulf us too!
Move it!
Array!
Come on!
Is this the consequence of what you believed in?
Good.
It's nice and tainted.
We're almost there.
Say...
Tell me something.
Who are you?
On that day 20,000 years ago,
I watched you, just like I am doing right now.
Queen Maycun.
I watched you go through everything.
The history you shared with the Vox...
Queen Maycun did just as we had planned.
Yes. Now, all we need is for her to open the Rinne.
How your most trusted and closest people betrayed you,
using you like a puppet...
Tormenting you to the deepest and farthest depths of your inner mind.
Why?
Why?!
I witnessed everything, Queen Maycun.
Good.
Then you can answer my questions
without holding anything back.
What did you do to Dizelmine?
Nothing.
Although you could say that I helped him
realize his true feelings.
True feelings?
He finally realized the hatred he felt towards Villagiulio.
So you made him open the Rinne.
And?
What is it that you seek?
This whole world is about to be swallowed into nothingness again.
What will this madness bring you?!
Do you not wish to hear it?
To hear its voice?
The Rinne is a place where people's hearts connect.
The Vox acts as an interface between those two worlds,
like a bridge guard.
It grants passage to those it has deemed worthy
by bestowing them the Memoria.
I then realized, the stronger the bond
between those who've achieved Memoria and their Vox,
the more that person's will is converted into the power of the Rinne.
And that's when I felt it...
The will of a greater presence!
In the past, in an attempt to hear that voice,
I tried giving myself to the Vox.
But my soul was not deemed worthy of the Memoria.
No matter how many times I tried, no matter what I did!
I drowned in despair.
That's when you appeared before me.
And yet!
You think you have the right to condemn me?!
You make me laugh!
Everything goes back to that day, when you didn't fulfill my desire...
You're the one who's at fault here!
You used Madoka just for that?!
I failed, Midori.
I couldn't win.
I had to beat him at all cost.
If I didn't, it would mean that Lan's brother was right.
I hate this...
My phone works in here?
Email? Who is it from?
I believe this is our destiny.
Destiny?
That's right.
I can't do this by myself.
You can't do this by yourself, either.
But if we join hands and work together,
we can overcome any problems the Polyhedron might face in the future...
We're comrades.
Yeah, we're in this together, through good and bad times.
So that's what happened.
Geez, why didn't you just say so?
Huh?
What's that, Midori? Look up?
Ouch! That hurt...
What was that for?!
Okay, then!
We want to talk.
Madoka, Muginami. I'm sorry...
My beloved brother has turned into a demon.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Madoka, Lan...
I know I always depend on you guys too much.
So I thought I should at least try and avenge my Big Brother on my own, but...
Ouch!
That hurt!
Muginami!
Oww!
Lan?
Madoka?
What do you know!
You're here!
I didn't care who it was.
As long as it was someone who would give in to their emotions, and unleash it completely.
Anyone with the potential,
to allow me to hear that voice from the Rinne.
I suppose I should thank you.
I now know what needs to be done.
There's nothing more you can do.
No, there is one thing.
Believe in Madoka.
I see...
You and Muginami decided what to do after high school.
We're sorry.
Don't apologize.
It's only natural to want to return to your home planets.
No, about not telling you until today...
Yeah, if the two of you had left Kamogawa without saying anything,
I probably would've been angry.
I think I understand how Lan's brother felt.
It's just like how you two are my comrades.
Lan's brother believed that Big Brother Giuvi was his comrade.
Brother...
And another voice.
Thank goodness...
Big Brother...
Attention all planets of the Polyhedron!
Le Garite and De Metrio
have agreed to a cease-fire effective immediately!
Thank you, Orca, for protecting me till today.
I'll always love you, Hupo.
All right!
Let's go, Midori!
Stop feeling sorry for yourself and dragging down the entire universe!
You and Villagiulio's feelings are...
Just like...
us!
We've finally gotten this far. It's our last episode.
So many things have happened.
They've all turned out to be good memories. Right?
Even if the three of us aren't going to be together...
Even if I'll never be able to see the two of you again...
We will always be the Sweats Club!
On the water's surface I see a light reflected that stirs my heart
When we realized our bond,
we were already deeply connected under the blue sky
We had so much fun, as in a daze, that time seemed forgotten
I prayed that there would be no end to the way we lived
I won't forget our days together, although time goes by,
and you are far from me now,
because you left behind a wonderful world
for me to wait in
