I must be the only guy in history to get a gift from a rental girlfriend!
She must see me as someone special.
I did it!
It's a small one, but I built another connection with her!

I mean...
I'm a girlfriend.
But... I don't know... It might give your clients the wrong idea.
I'm a girlfriend.
Yeah, but... a g-gif
I'm a girlfriend, okay?
It's perfectly normal for a girlfriend to give you gifts!
And it's agency policy!
Uh, that much is true, but...
I know I'm totally nothhhh justified here...
I'd like to clear something up here and now.
Have you fallen in love with me?
Huh... What?!
I haven't.
Exactly!
We're only playing pretend couple for our grandmas, right?
Ruka-chan seems to think there's more to it,
but I'm nothing more than a rental girlfriend.
If you were actually into me, that'd change things entirely.
Let's keep things clean,
and this relationship purely business.
Whoa, she's so pretty!
That dude's so lucky.
Hey! What have you two been getting up to?!
Ruka-chan?!
You told me you had other plans today!
Leap
It was a date with her?!
You cheat!! You're cheating on me!!
Why her, when you have me?!
I got cheated on!!
U-Uh, I was just getting some life advice from her.
I can't believe I just said that.
Well, you're going on a date with me now!
But I have plans...
Cancel them!
What? Come on!
Poker face...
A movie? The amusement park?
Here.

A blindfold!?

I need to take you somewhere.
Wh-Where?
This way.
Keep the blindfold on.
That's so funny!
What the heck?
I guess I should do what she wants. I did do her wrong today, after all.

What's going on? Where are we?
You can take off the blindfold now.
Huh?

Mind giving me an explanation?
An explanation of what?
Your relationship with Chizuru-san!
You two have gone way past rental girlfriend and client!
T-True.
Wait, why'd you take off your socks, then?
I was just getting comfy.
I remember you talking about grandmas and whatnot, but that's all.
So tell me everything.
Well, I guess she does know everything else.
I see. I think I get the gist of it now.
We've been living on the edge, as much as I hate to admit it.
What are you thinking?!
There's no way you can keep that lie up forever!
W-Well...
Will you keep it up even when you're old and gray?
Remain a bachelor forever?
The fee's going up by a thousand starting this month.
Thank you once again.
She's a rental girlfriend, you know! You two don't have a future together!
B-But Gran totally believes that we're dating!
There's a simple solution to that.
You can just introduce me to her!
You have a girlfriend. You don't need to turn to Chizuru-san anymore.
I'll really lose her trust if I hop from one girl to another!
Besides, she's taken an abnormal liking to Mizuhara.
It won't be easy to just replace her.
Can you have sex with Chizuru-san?
Where'd that come from?!
That's what it's all about, isn't it? A successor?
H-Hang on!
You can't, right? She's just a rental girlfriend.
No matter how long you keep it up, you and she can only have a platonic relationship!
Is that what your grandma wants?
I'll have you know I'm ready to take it all in.
Look, I can't!
I'm actually thinking of the long term here!
I wouldn't have brought you here otherwise!
So she was after this all along.
Do you not like me trying to get closer to you this way?
S-Sorry! Bathroom!

Asakusa Station
We're doing lunch and a shrine visit, so it'll take half the day.
Well, not like we have a choice. I'm supposed to be your girlfriend.
It'd be too weird if I didn't see your family for New Year's.
Mizuhara...
Oh, but you will still have to pay, okay?
O-Of course.
Mom... Wearing a kimono is a bit over the top.
What are you talking about?
We mustn't slight the soon-to-be Kinoshita in any way!
Hello, my angel! Oh, and Kazuya, too.
I'm just an aside?
Oh, Grandmother. Happy New Year.
Here's to another great year together.
You're just as pretty in the new year!
Happy New Year!
That's a beautiful kimono.
It's way too nice for me.
Not at all. It suits you very well.
Yeah, there's no replacing her for Gran.
Happy New Year.
I'm Sarashina Ruka, and I'll be joining you today.

Do you know her?
Uh, y-yeah, she's a friend!
Oh, it's Grandmother! The real deal!
Real deal?
Kazuya-san's told me so much about you that I've been wanting to meet you.
Harumi-san.
Hello? This is Kinoshita. We have a reservation for five...
Kazuya told you about me?
Yes. He told me how you were the most amazing grandmother.
How did she find out about this? She even knew where we were meeting up.
Oh? Is that so?
I have no idea!
Don't tell me... it was back then?
Looks to me like you do have an idea.
Oh, uh, no...
Did she see the message then?
Asakusa Station
I don't think she'll immediately spill the beans about us, but it's still risky.
I must say, you are a very pretty young lady.
Please, you flatter me!

Let's go, Kazuya-san.
How do you know them, Ruka-san?
I'm
Sh-She's Chizuru's friend!
What? Chizuru-san's friend?!
Starry -eyed
We kept running into her on dates, and at some point she and I became friends, too.
Right, Chizuru?
Y-Yes, our parents are friends.
We've practically grown up together, like sisters.
I'm his girlfriend.
I'm Kazuya-san's girlfriend.
Girl...friend?
What are you talking about, Ruka-chan? You know that's not
I'm his girlfriend.
No, Chizuru's my girlfriend...
I'm his girlfriend.
The rest of you, go in.
Kazuya, we need to talk.
O-Okay.
Er... Shall we head on in, then?
Y-Yeah.
I-I'm in trouble!
We're the Kinoshitas. We have a reservation.
U-Uh, I need to visit the restroom.
Come with me, Ruka-chan?
Japanese Restaurant
Ow!
You're cheating on her?! You're two-timing her, aren't you?!
N-No, you're wrong! Ow!
You already have Chizuru-san!
Even if she'll stand for it, I won't!
Listen to me!
Choose! Either you cut ties with us,
or you break up with Ruka-dono!
Again, it's not what you think!
How, exactly?!
Sh-She's a pathological liar!
What? A liar?
Yeah. She's usually a nice girl, but she says the most random things at times.
And Chizuru's too nice to cut her off.
T-Too unbelievable, huh?
I see. That must be rough.
You believe me?
It's hard to believe Chizuru would let you two-time her,
and even harder to believe you'd have two girls falling for you.
Good point!
And we can't turn away a friend of hers.
I'll let Kazuo and Harumi know for you.
Close shave
What are you playing at?
Right back at you! Do you seriously think you can keep this farce up forever?
Kazuya-kun told me everything.
You're overstepping your boundaries as a rental girlfriend.
You mustn't get involved in a client's personal life. That's just common sense!
I can take over as girlfriend, and you can ride off into the sunset.
Don't you think that's the best option here?
It's not that simple!
Oh, but it is.
And it's far more realistic than what you're doing!
Do you really think this is helping your grandmothers?
You're lying to them, you know!
I'll admit that we've dragged this on too long, but it's a complicated situation!
You two are the ones overcomplicating it!
Or maybe...
Flinch
Fondle
Hey, what are you doing?
You just like Kazuya-kun, don't you?
You don't want me taking him away from you.
You're wrong!
Maybe it's you who wants to stay on as his girlfriend.
I'm serious about him, okay?
If you're not, please walk away like a proper rental girlfriend.
What the heck?
He's really bad with thrill rides,
so he was terrified.
Oh.
And he was just so cute.
Is that so?
Kazuya-san, you've got sauce on your face.

Try not to make such a mess, okay?

What's the matter?
You're an angel, Chizuru-san!
I can't believe you deal with this every time you see her!
Seriously, you're amazing.
What do you mean?
You know, Ruka's thing.
A pathological liar?!
Jeez, you idiot! Why'd you have to give me that backstory?!
Sorry, I made it up on the spot!
Ow, ow!
I knew it was weird!
Your grandma and parents were smiling at me like some kinda saints!
I have to go fix this!
Wait! I'm telling you, my family believes Mizuhara's my girlfriend!
If you keep pushing it, they'll think I'm two-timing!
What's the big deal? You're lying to them about Chizuru-san, anyway.
There's no difference between zero-timing and two-timing!
They're polar opposites!
I mean, aren't I your girlfriend?
Well...
You said you'd make me your girlfriend, if only as a trial at first.
I-I know...
But with your grandma, we have to act like Chizuru-san's your girlfriend,
and I'm just a friend?
That's just too much for me!
Close! Too close!
I'm your girlfriend.
That's the role I want.
I-It's almost time for the shrine visit, I think.

Range
I heard you told your folks she's a pathological liar.
Y-Yeah.
And she was okay with that?
What do you think?
I don't believe you. Way to add fuel to the fire.
What choice did I have?
Kazuya.
What's up?
Well, we've lost Mom and Sarashina-san.
Are you all right? Do you feel sick?
No.
It's Kazuya.
Nope. She's not answering.
We shouldn't have trusted her to keep her end of the deal.
We can't pass the rental girlfriend thing off as a lie if she tells her.
Let's split up and look for them.
Gotcha!
What's the matter?
Tell her... I have to tell her!
I'm not a liar!
And Chizuru-san's a rental girlfriend!
It's not fair of you two to keep lying to her!
Ruka-dono?
Am I wrong?
What she wants is a successor.
Then I'm the better fit!
I'm the one who can actually marry him!
Chizuru-san's just a rental. I'm his real girlfriend!
She may be a rental, but Mizuhara is...
the best girlfriend anyone could ask for!
I have to tell her!
Anyway, I'm glad I got to meet you today.
It's my first time meeting a friend of Chizuru-san's.
There's so much I want to ask you.
Like what?
How does she usually act?
Is it any different from how she behaves around us?
Given how Kazuya's not much of a ladies' man at all,
as head of the Kinoshita family, I can't help but put her on a pedestal.
I hope that isn't proving to be a cause of stress for her.
How many friends does she have?
What are her favorite pastimes?
What does she like, and what does she dislike?
What are her favorite foods, and what makes her laugh the most?
This is all I've been thinking about lately. All day, every day.
It's as though this bag of bones has fallen in love with a young girl.
No... It's not a granddaughter-in-law that she wants.
It's Chizuru-san herself!
Forgive me for the barrage of questions. You must think I'm annoying.
No...
Grandmother!
Oh, Chizuru-san.
You suddenly went missing. We were all so worried.
Sorry about that. Ruka-dono and I were just having a chat...
You're completely out of breath, Chizuru-san!
Are you okay?!
Oh, yes, I'm fine.
Shall we head to the shrine, then?
Let's have another chat sometime, Ruka-dono.
Yes, definitely.
Sorry about that, everyone.
Don't just wander off like that.
We were so worried!
Don't act like I'm on my last legs!
Okay, let's go pray for a thriving business!

And I hate Chizuru-san for meddling in your family's affairs as a rental girlfriend.
But I couldn't do it!
I knew it wasn't the right time to tell her!
Ruka-chan...
Just no kissing or clinging to Chizuru-san!
Why would I? She's a rental girlfriend!
I'm not giving up, okay?
One day, your grandma will accept me as your real girlfriend.
This is going to be a battle of endurance. You'd best be ready.
Endurance?

That'd be the worst fortune possible.
I don't know why, but I hurt inside.
I'll make that pain go away. Just put on a blindfold again.
