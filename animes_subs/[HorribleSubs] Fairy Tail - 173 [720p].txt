Lucy-san! Are you awake?!
Which match is it right now?
The first match just finished.
It looks like Blue Pegasus won.
The second match is just about to begin.
It's between Lamia Scale and Mermaid Heel.
I see... Then Natsu and the others' match hasn't started yet.
Natsu-san said he'd come and see you before his match.
Rest up a little more until then.
It's important for you to get your strength back.
Thank you. I will.
Alright! The second match is next.
From Lamia Scale,
Lyon and Yuka!
And from Mermaid Heel,
Kagura and Millianna are competing!
Feelin' spiffy!
Let's feel the love for Mermaid Heel!
Yajima-san, what are your thoughts on this match?
I wouldn't be surprised if either side won.
I'm certainly looking forward to this match.
Both Lyon and Yuka are strong opponents!
Millianna! Don't let your guard down!
Are you rooting for Mermaid Heel?
Yeah. We've known each other a long time.
It's only natural that I'd want to support her.
Gray, you've known Lyon for a long time, right?
Aren't you interested in this?
Not really.
We're in different guilds now and are rivals.
What's wrong, Natsu?
I was thinking that Lucy and Elfman would probably like to see the matches, too.
In that case, let's watch it carefully for them.
So we can tell them about it later.
Guess you're right...
Alright! I'll do it.
Battle of the Dragon Slayers!
I hope Mermaid Heel wins.
I've known Millianna since that Tower of Heaven business, see.
I guess I'm rooting for Lamia Scale.
They've been a big help.
Certainly, we have a history with Lamia Scale...
Juvia, I guess you're cheering for Lyon, huh?
You've been approached by Lyon more than once, right?
Having a woman's heart, you must be interested, right?
Juvia... Juvia...
That's it! There's still a chance!
If someone on the team gets injured during the match, and they become short a person...
I knew that you were the only partner for me!
Kiss!
Juvia...
I'm overjoyed, Gray-sama!
No!
As a member of the guild, Juvia is a bad girl for wishing injuries on her comrades!
But Juvia wants to be by Gray-sama's side!
And yet...! Juvia doesn't want her guildmates to get hurt!
What should Juvia do?!
W-What's wrong, Juvia?
Is there something on your mind?
We'll give you good counsel, so go ahead and share with us girls.
After this match is over,
the next one is between Fairy Tail and Sabertooth at last.
All we need to do is have faith in them.
Let's take a load off and wait...
First Master!
Everyone, make sure you look before you sit down.
Maybe...
Millianna...
Focus.
I know!
At first, try fighting this match on your own.
I'm going to hold back for a while.
I don't believe this! Why?!
So you can gain experience...
Match or not, this is a real fight.
How far can you battle with just your own power?
You should try it.
Alright. I will!
Our opponents are two women.
But if we don't go all out against those two, it's doubtful that we'll achieve victory.
That's because Kagura is one of them.
But if I strut my stuff for her...
Hey, that might be a little cocky...
Hey! If you don't do this right, I'll make the both of you spin!
The time limit is 30 minutes!
Alright, let the match begin-kabo!
Victory goes to the swiftest!
Cat Binding Tube!
Is Millianna fighting alone?!
Will she be okay against opponents from Lamia Scale?
Kagura must have figured she'd be able to handle it.
Let's leave it to her judgment.
Kagura-chan doesn't need to take part!
They're really making light of us...
They must be confident...
You... Mermaid Heel...
Lyon! Yuka! Do whatever you have to do to win!
Show them how strong we are!
Kagura is just watching?
In that case, let's drag her to the party!
Ice Make: Eagle!
Don't ignore me!
Wave!
She's fast!
Kitten Blast!
A fake-out, huh?
Gotcha!
Cat punch! Cat punch! Punch!
There it is!
The first attack that's landed is by Mermaid Heel!
Great! You're cookin' with gas!
She's totally relaxed as she fights.
Maybe it's because she feels secure with Kagura behind her.
You ain't seen nothin' yet!
I train with Kagura-chan every day!
Secret weapon!
Scratch attack!
What's wrong? You're not putting up any resistance!
This is a surprise!
Those two are the go-to wizards of Lamia Scale, but Millianna isn't giving an inch!
It seems that both of her opponents are flummoxed
by her quick, cat-like moves.
Ow... That girl is better than I thought...
If she weren't, it wouldn't be interesting!
Cat Binding Tube!
But...
Huh. In that case, how's this?!
Cat Binding Tube!
Double! Triple! Uh...
A lot!
So you can produce several at once, huh?
My techniques are evolving, too!
Ice Make: Eagle!
She's doing it again!
You're just wasting your energy!
Well? How about giving up?
This is no good...
At this rate, I won't be able to look cool in front of Juvia!
Hey, you're still worried about that?
But...
This is the only thing to do against a cat opponent!
Ice Make: Mouse!
A mouse! Whee!
Wait for me!
Don't insult my intelligence!
Next up is this!
Blow, blizzard!
I-It's cold...
Cats don't like winter...
A kotatsu!
Cats love kotatsus...
It's comfy and warm...
Would you stop treating me like a cat?!
I didn't think they'd trick Millianna with that kind of method!
That's Lyon of Lamia Scale for you. You can't be too cautious with him.
Um... Are you guys really that impressed?
Did you see that, Juvia? My beautiful brain play!
She's turned off...
Lyon Vastia...
You haven't directly attacked Millianna yet.
Great! Great!
This is a tough battle for both Mermaid Heel and Lamia Scale!
Kabo! Kabo! Kabo!
Hey! Lyon and Yuka, quit standing around!
If you don't win this right now, I'm gonna make you spin!
What happens if you get spun?
I can't really describe it,
but anyway, it's really bad for sure!
Obaba's right.
At this rate, we're gonna run out of the 30-minute time limit and it'll be a draw.
Then I have no choice.
I intended to save Kagura for last, but...
Ice Make: Snow Tiger!
I love cats, but tigers are another thing!
Kagura-chan... I'm sorry...
I suppose I have to participate after all...
So you've finally decided to play, Kagura!
I'll go first!
Wave!
An attack that nullifies your opponent's magic, eh?
However...
Good heavens!
Mermaid Heel's Kagura...
Wave!
You're slow!
Incredible!
She's downed Yuka by not giving him a moment to retaliate!
At last, it's just Kagura and Lyon!
One on one!
She beat one of them without even drawing her sword?
Impressive...
Yeah. Kagura is an expert with a sheathed sword.
Maybe she'd be a worthy opponent for my Iron Dragon Sword.
W-Will Lyon be okay?
Even though he had a hard time against Millianna,
going one on one against Kagura...
What? Lyon hasn't unleashed his true strength yet.
Lyon! No matter what, you'd better win!
Show her your power!
I've heard about you.
You once went by the name Reitei.
You attempted a dangerous ritual in order to fight Deliora.
That was a long time ago.
Now, I'm Lyon, a wizard with Lamia Scale.
Nothing more or less.
But something about you reminds me of the way I used to be.
Back when I was driven by hatred and had lost sight of something...
Let me ask you one thing.
Why didn't you attack Millianna directly?
Did you hold back because she's a woman?
Or just because you didn't want to reveal your strategy to me?
Who knows?
Maybe you'll find out when you fight me!
Ice Make: Dragonfly!
Ice Make: Eagle!
Kagura really is strong!
Is Lyon powerless to do anything?!
What are you doin', Lyon?!
And you were Ur's disciple?!
You're stronger than that!
Get your act together now!
He's right.
Show me what you've really got, Lyon Vastia!
Yeah. And we are running out of time...
Ice Make: Snow Tiger!
Ice Make: Snow Ape!
Ice Make: Snow Dragon!
I bet not even you will be able to escape this!
You can create all these at the same time?
Still...
There it is! Her ace in the hole, Gravity Change!
Yep! That's Kagura's magic!
Still, for Kagura to use Gravity Change,
it proves that Lyon guy is a tough opponent.
W-What power!
It ends here!
Time's up! 30 minutes have passed!
It's a tie-kabo!
The result is a draw!
It wasn't settled after 30 minutes!
So close!
Just a little more time and Lyon would've been toast!
But a tie's a tie.
Ah, well, it looks like Kagura isn't too bothered by it...
He squeaked by with a draw.
But what a close call...
This is what happens when you've got girls on the mind!
When you get back here, you're going to spin and spin and spin!
I'm gonna spin you like never before!
Kagura really is strong, you know?
And I don't think she was pulling out all the stops...
It's the same every year.
Nobody's seen Kagura get totally serious before.
Kagura-chan, I'm sorry...
That Lyon has natural aptitude.
If this had been a life-or-death battle instead of a match,
you'd be dead right now.
Get stronger, Millianna.
I'm going to train you harder.
Right!
The crowd is still pumped up here at the arena!
But don't take your eyes off of the next battle!
At last!
Yep. At last...
At long last!
Finally...
Natsu-san, Gajeel-kun, don't get hurt!
No injuries! Nobody is allowed to get hurt!
Why are you so obsessed with injuries?
Yo.
How do you feel?
I'm okay.
Is your match next?
Yeah. And I'll win it for sure.
Natsu...
Sorry, Lucy-san! We just went to check out what's happening at the arena.
Oh! Natsu?
Wendy, Carla... Take care of her.
Good luck, Natsu-san!
Lucy! What were you talking about with Natsu?
You ready?
Yeah.
Let's make Lucy and the rest happy by winnin' this thing.
Natsu!
Happy...
I'm sure all of our viewers have been eagerly looking forward to this battle.
A fateful showdown between the guild that was called the strongest
seven years ago and the strongest current guild!
Fairy Tail's Natsu and Gajeel
versus Sabertooth's Sting and Rogue!
And all four of them are Dragon Slayers.
All four possess anti-dragon magic.
Sting-kun...
I've been waiting for this moment.
The White Dragon, Weisslogia...
The Shadow Dragon, Skiadrum...
Show me...
Have humans surpassed dragons?
Or is that just a fleeting dream?
It is almost time for us to act...
The Festival of the Dragon King is almost upon us.
The dream Dragon Slayer showdown is finally happening!
Sock it to'em!
Get'em for us, too!
I have faith you'll win!
It's about to start.
I'm sure Natsu will be okay.
I'm sure he'll win!
The time to clash is here at last!
Who will win, Fairy or Tiger?!
All four dragons are on the battlefield!
Fight to the best of your ability. There's nothing else to say.
I've been waiting years for this, Natsu-san.
I've been looking forward to it, too-kabo!
The time limit is 30 minutes!
Let the match begin!
Here I go!
Yeah!
Roar of the White Dragon!
A laser?!
Slash of the Shadow Dragon!
Rogue!
Wingbeat of the Fire Dragon!
W-What's this?!
Sting and Rogue...
The Twin Dragons of Fiore's strongest guild are on the ropes!
He really is strong... But I'd be disappointed otherwise.
Gajeel...
Did you two really defeat dragons with power like that?
Not defeat...
I killed a dragon with this very hand.
Wasn't it your parent?
It's got nothin' to do with you.
From now, I'm gonna show you the power that killed a dragon!
White Drive...
Shadow Drive.
Let's go!
Finally... Finally, it's come!
It's here, huh?
My...
Natsu's...
I don't know if these guys are new generation Dragon Slayers or what,
but I'm gonna kick that blond poser's ass!
Do your best, Natsu!
Next time: Four Dragons!
And then I'm gonna beat up the remaining dark-haired duo!
You're including Gajeel...
Ah, whatever... Do your best, Natsu!
