In a way, I can turn Jirou's stuff into my stuff!
Move it!
Hiya!
Ook!
What?
Now that's what I call a barrier against evil!
I wonder what's happening on this world

I fly through the sky into space

Around, around the world

I want to tell you that I love you, even if it confuses me

Sometimes love keeps being one-sided

It's gotten so hopelessly complex

Hey, God,

I'm your god

I think

Oh, wow! What's this light?
You okay, Daidaimaru?
Yeah.
It's weird.
I feel more at peace somehow.
It's like our nymph sister is giving me a hug and keeping me warm.

I am certain she is looking for me as we speak.
No, once she undid Jirou's barrier, she said she'd use a white talisman to find Master Soujoubou's soul.
She asked me to give you this and said you'd know what to do.
Clever girl.
A land god's white talisman...
I hid his soul somewhere within this compound
where the crows cannot find it.
Where in the world did that bastard...

The God Receives a Romantic Confession
Move.
A door?
It leads underground and has been sealed for seventeen years.
This is the only place in the compound that we would never tread.
To think that bastard knew about it...
Wait!
I'm coming too.
Honestly,
I should probably wait for Tomoe and the others,
but I'm not about to let Jirou go in there alone.
This seems to go a long way down.
Why did it get sealed off?
Seventeen years ago, there was an accident,
and one crow was disabled for life.
This is the cave of the thunderbolt beast of Kurama.
You would be wise to fear its wrath.
When you say disabled for life, do you mean...
He shall never again take to the skies.
Just as he deserves.
You should've left that brat alone.
It's too late for tears, Suirou.
That's what you get for making friends.
You get tripped up.
This is the thunderbolt beast's cave?
Soujoubou's soul is down there...
Stay here.
Don't get closer, no matter what.

Th-That's true, but...
He doesn't seem like the same Jirou I met in the dungeon.
It's like the fight's left him.
He kept his back turned to me the whole time. Me, an intruder.
That thunderbolt was huge!
One hit, and you're a goner.
One crow was disabled for life.
All right.
I'm going too.
Suirou.
You fool.
You will never get your wings back.
It's too late for tears.
I cannot help it. This pain...
But when I thought about how Shinjurou might've died down there...
Cursed thunderbolt beast...
So my scent has awakened it.
I'd better hurry.
I-I didn't realize it was so close by.
Mamoru!
Barrier against evil!
When I thought Shinjurou may have died...
Before I knew it, I was already moving.
I have no regrets.
Your white talisman had better work, crow!
Of course it'll work.

Wherever the talisman goes, Nanami should be there too.
Hey, wait a second!
That way lies...
That way lies...
the place where I was traumatized!
Master Shinjurou, what is the matter?
No...
I can't let things get to me now.
Once this situation gets taken care of,
I'm going back to the mundane world, after all.
Jirou?!
You protected me?
Why?
Get away from me.
Because of you, I've ended up playing the fool as well.
In the face of my foxfire, a sheltered thunderbolt beast of Kurama...
may as well be a kitten.
Tomoe...
Letting your curiosity get the best of you?
As they say, that will cost you.
Are you all right, Nanami?
Hang in there, Jirou!
What should I do?
He's really hurt.
I'm sorry.
Because of me...
Don't cry.
I couldn't bear seeing the woman I fell for die before my eyes.
That's all.
Fell...

Ew! That guy just threw up something!
Look! The stuff he threw up is shining!
I don't want to look at that stuff!
His soul... It must be the master's missing soul.
What?
I see.
So he had the thunderbolt beast swallow it.
No wonder it couldn't be found.
Shinjurou, you must return it to the master. It's up to you now.
What? But I'm an outsider.
No, you are the only one who can do it.
I no longer have the wings to stand atop the mountain,
nor the dignity to face the Third.
It falls to you. I cannot trust anyone else.
Please.
Jirou!
Jirou!
Don't cry.
I want to see you smile,
but I can no longer see what is before me.
I see only darkness before me.
I walk alone.

How long are you going to weep like that?
But it was all my fault...
You needn't worry. He is not going to die.
We gave him the Peach Pills.
He should be fine in two or three days.
If Jirou loses his ability to fly, I don't know how I can ever make it up to him.
Even if that were to happen,
that man would suffer it happily.
Because he was able to save you.
Oh, it's you, Master Familiar. Lady Nanami.
Oh, Suirou.
I received word that Jirou had been injured, so I came to see how he's doing.
What is the matter, Master Familiar?
You look most displeased.
By the way, where's Shinjurou?
He's with the master right now.
The Third has overcome his illness and will awaken soon.
Please let everyone in the village know.
The dark clouds will clear, new plants will sprout,
and the mountain will surely be restored.
17 years since descending the mountain. See how I have grown.
This isn't my freakin' feather.
He fell for this?
You're an idiot, my sire.
Seriously...
The mountain will surely be restored.
The eternal cherry blossom tree will bloom again too.
Weird. By crushing these leaves I can make a medicinal ointment?
Their book on medicinal herbs is awesome.
It's been two days since then.
Their master has awakened.
And bit by bit, everything on Mount Kurama has recovered as well.
Everything except Jirou.
Brother Jirou is going to be fine.
According to Brother Suirou, his body has been healing exceptionally well.
If anything, he is a tough crow.
You must also return to the mundane world soon, do you not?
I do, but...
I'll stay here until Jirou wakes up.
Ah, yes. Do you know of the eternal cherry blossom tree on the hill?
It is in full bloom right now.
Care to go see it with everyone?
Thick, black clouds are lingering over the mountain.
Dammit! The plants cannot flourish in this condition!
Jirou.
Come on, Jirou. What are you doing?
Soujoubou!
My deepest apologies, sir.
I am entirely to blame for this predicament.
A bad guy came and lead me astray with his foolish words, and I lost sight of myself.
I cannot stay on the mountain any longer.
It is all well and good.
You are hardly the first.
Everybody makes mistakes.
It is the one enduring truth that has not changed throughout the ages.
Shinjurou is no different.
Fumimaru and the other little crows all make mistakes as well.
Even Suirou.
He may seem composed and infallible.
Crash
Crash
But he had a nasty habit of knocking over my poor bonsai trees.
Absent-minded though he may be, the amazing thing about him is that he never lets these things get to him.
Of course,
I make mistakes as well.
Everybody is the same.
Even you
are the same as everybody else.
Yes, sir.
The clouds...
Those thick clouds are clearing up!
They've cleared up.
And that maiden...
I can see her as well.
I, too,
will walk in the light with you.
There!
There!
There!
Hey, is something wrong?
It's nothing.
There!
I sensed Jirou's presence just now.
Boys!
It seems Master Jirou has finally come to!
Brother Suirou is tending to him now.
Truly?!
Peach Pills, huh?
That medicine saved you.
You must be grateful to that girl, Jirou.
How does it feel to wake up to your shattered dreams?
That was harsh.
But while you were asleep, Shinjurou kept the compound running smoothly.
Thanks to that, our Great Brothers are all over the moon.
In honor of your recovery, he is holding a cherry blossom viewing party tonight.
You will attend with me, won't you?
Cherry blossom viewing...
Suirou!
I heard that Jirou's awake!
Please excuse me!
These past two days, I only thought of Jirou getting well, so I sorta half-forgot about it,
but Jirou confessed his feelings for me.
Wow. After all that, you could not even speak to the poor guy.
How stupid.
But it's the first time in my life that a guy's said he liked me!
Just hurry up and go thank him or apologize to him or whatever.
After all, we are leaving tonight.
Tonight?
Yes, is that a problem for you?
No, it just seems kinda sudden.
With Jirou finally well again, surely, there is no reason for us to stay any longer.
He has a point...
I guess that's true...
Of course, if you do not wish to go back, you could always stay here by yourself.
Wh-What am I supposed to do if I stay here by myself?
Obviously, you could spend your time getting to know Jirou better.
You should count your blessings.
He may be a crow, but he is a rare man to have fallen for a scrawny little girl like you.
Grr
Grr
Grr
Grr
Grr
Grr
Grr
Grr
M-Maybe you're right.
He seems earnest, unlike a certain fox I know.
And he seems like someone who'd cherish me.
Indeed, he sounds like a man of fine character.
After all, it seems he sees you as a celestial nymph.
If that is what you wish to do, I certainly will not stop you.
Yo, let's go, you guys! It's time for the cherry blossom viewing!
Kurama!
Come on! Everybody's waiting for us!
Get a move on, fox. What're you lying around for?
A cherry blossom viewing? Now?
Yeah, because I'll be going home tonight.
This is one last hurrah for Brother Jirou's health.
In anticipation of the succession ceremony of the Fourth, Brother Jirou put in the order for this meal.
It was scheduled for today, so we ended up receiving this bounty from the caterer.
I'd like everyone to feast to their heart's content.
And in celebration of Jirou's recovery and the revival of the mountain...
Cheers!
My stomach has begun to ache.
Mind if I excuse myself?
Oh, no, you don't.
Mingle with everyone and do your duty.
Botanmaru!
Ah, it is the land god!
Wow! What an incredible feast!
You see, Jirou got this for the succession ceremony...
Stop it.
A woman!
Please, take any open seat.
Nanami, this seat is open
Awesome! Tri-color dumplings!
Maiden.
You can take the seat next to mine.
Th-Thank you for saving me that time.
I should be thanking you.
Thanks to your medicine, I didn't suffer any permanent damage.
Is it just me, or are the crows clearing out from the area around me?
They're all wary of you because you're a woman.
Maybe I should've picked up on the vibe and declined to attend.
Come.
Too high! Too high!
Tomoe!
You are safe.
Open your eyes.
It's beautiful!
It's like I'm inside a flower!
Have you come to like the village of Kurama?
Yes.
The air here is so clean.
And the children are adorable too.
Then you could remain here...
forever.
Master Familiar, you are spilling sake everywhere.
Oh, dishrag, dishrag...
That's my apron!
Dishrag, dishrag...
You are hilariously pathetic, fox.
If you're that worried about her, I could always take you up there so you can chaperone them.
Worried about her? I have no idea what you're talking about.

So you're cool with those lovebirds sitting in a tree?
They could be K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
He does not possess the nerve to force himself upon Nanami without her consent.
If she wanted me to look after her, she would've called for me by now.
As a human, her life is short.
She should spend her time doing what makes her happy.
If staying here with him fulfills that criteria, then I will not stand in their way.
Take it from someone who's actually spent time with humans.
Human lives are short, so if you have something you want to say, then say it now.
Or before you know it, you'll have missed your chance.
I wish...
I wish you would stay.
It'd be nice.
I forgot. I still have to return your medicine.
The Peach Pills.
If it not for those,
I would've likely lost my wings just as Brother Suirou had when he met the beast.
It worked even better than I'd heard.
Is it something that is passed down at your shrine?
No, I got these in exchange for some donuts.
Doh-nuts?
Yeah, you see, I originally got them to protect Tomoe.
Maybe some day if Tomoe ever decides he doesn't need me anymore, and he wants to go off on his own...
I can give him these as a parting gift.
He's strong, so...
He doesn't have anyone who'll keep him safe.
That's why it's the least I can give him in my stead...
I see.
I had no idea how precious this medicine was.
I'm sorry I took some of it.
Oh, don't worry. It's not like that at all.
A little while longer...
Do you mind if we stay like this for just a little while longer?
I will burn this image into my mind.
And when I close my eyes, I will be able to see you again, sitting amongst the flowers.
Goodness! I am terribly sorry.
Hey, can you hear me?
Tomoe! Tomoe! Tomoe!
Before I knew what was happening, Lady Nanami had gotten completely drunk.
What? Wh-Why is she drunk?!
Tomoe! Tomoe!
Hey, can you hear me?
It seems she overindulged on sake-flavored buns. The higher-proof ones.
Tomoe!
Tomoe!
That night, I was looking
Maybe it's time we said our goodbyes too.
at the fleeting remnants of the day
Thank you, Suirou!
Oh, Brother Suirou!
The milky way spread across my vision
I can hear flutes and drums playing in the distance.
It was very beautiful
When spring comes around, I'll visit them again.
Hey, can you hear me?
Tomoe! Come on, Tomoe!
Where'd Kurama go?
To hell with that bastard!
Hey, that crow mountain was a lot of fun, wasn't it?
I don't think I can talk to other people about this
Tomoe, are you listening to me?
Tomoe!
I am listening.
Tomoe...
I'll call up God, I think
I love you so much.
If a new day hadn't begun
I...
then yesterday's tomorrow would be today
and yesterday would be the day before
love you too.
I'm waiting for you
I'll stay here
Tomoe's back was so warm and comfortable.
The boat is stopped here
It made me happy somehow.
If today weren't today
I'm going back too, you know!
and were that day instead, oh, that'd be nice
On this thing!
Kirihito heads to the Netherworld again to retrieve Akura-oh's body.

Hey, can you hear me?
Meanwhile, the gang goes to the Year God's Shrine to receive the Year God's Talisman
and go through gates said to review the last twelve years.
Oof... The twelve-year hangover.
Wait! Where's Nanami?!
Next time, The God Goes Back to Being a Child.
Hey, can you hear me?
The God Goes Back to Being a Child
The God Goes Back to Being a Child
Baa-buu.
