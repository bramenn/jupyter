Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
What happened?! Hey Ganju!
I-I'm sorry, Sis
I just showed him once.
I never imagined it would turn out like this!
Huh?!
I did it!
You did it, Kurosaki!
Yeah!
You idiot! Don't lose concentration!
Huh?
Weren't you listening to me, idiot?!
If you lose concentration, youll blow up!
Didnt I tell you that?
Yes, you did.
Thats right! I tell you, youre-!
Youre just as guilty, idiot!
Both of you, no food tonight!
Why put me together with him?!
Shut up! Got any complaints?!
Yoruichi?
So, Ichigo has finally completed a Cannonball?
Huh? Whats wrong?
Nothing to worry about. Hes only sleeping.
Now, I want you all to sit over there.
Ichigo is asleep, but we havent got much time.
I want to talk to you about what you can expect
after we invade the Seireitei.
You must-!

S-Silvervine?!
What What the heck was I dreaming about?
How should I know?!
I sure slept wellor, did I?
What am I doing sleeping here?
How should I know?‚Äù I said. Idiot!
What the heck are you doing, anyway?
Its none of your business! Get lost, will you, dandelion?!
What-?!
So, youre finally up. Its time for us to leave.
Huh? Leave?
Okay, so youre all here?
Yes, sir.
Huh?
Yoruichi, your tail looks like one of those flexible toothbrushes!
Oh!
Huh?!
What?
Do you have a problem with it?
N-No. Its a beautiful tail, as always
Dont you remember?! Youre responsible for that!
Huh? Me?
We
It took the three of us
to finally get you to let go, but
Ooh
My tailthe tail I was so proud of
Youd be smart to stay away from that subject!
G-Got it
Hey! What happened to Ganju?
Huh? I dunno
He was muttering about something downstairs.
Hold it!
The hero always arrives last.
Whats with that getup?
Its my very own battle costume. Dont I look cool?
Cry and beg all you want, but I wont lend it to you.
How do you like that?
Battle costume?
Whats it for, if youre just seeing us off?
A Soul Reaper killed my big brother.
Ganju! Why you!
Just shut up and listen, Sis!
My brotherwas a genius.
He managed to pass the Soul Reaper Academy entrance exam in one try.
At that time, his spiritual power was at Level 6.
Thats the same level as a lieutenant of the 13 Court Guarding Squads.
Then, he finished six years curriculum in one,
and he became a member of a Squad.
In just five years, he became a lieutenant.
But my brother was killed
betrayed by his Soul Reaper comrades!
I was still a kid back then, so I dont remember the details,
but there are two things Ill never forget.
Their faces! Two faces!
The ogre-like face of that Soul Reaper
who dragged my badly injured and dying brother home.
And the face of my brother as he happily gave thanks to that Soul Reaper.
Why did my brother do that? Why did he seem so happy?
To this day, I dont know.
But theres one thing I can say
My brother didnt blame Soul Reapers. He didnt hate them.
I never knew he had such a painful experience.
Why?!
Why didnt my brother despise Soul Reapers?!
Why did he continue to trust in the Soul Reapers?
Youre not like the other Soul Reapers.
I owe her
She saved my life. And I havent repaid her yet.
I don't want to turn into a pitiful guy who'd turn his back on her.
I have a feeling.
If I go with you, I might discover something.
Thats what I think.
Thats why Im gonna help you.
Ill go as far as I can, to see what a Soul Reaper is really like!
Ganju
Y-Youre really something, Big Bro!
Ganju
Youve grown up fine!
Humph! Looks like youve made up your mind.
Looks like I work with you.
Damn you
Everyone are you ready for the Cannonball?
Yes!
Huh? By the way
Huh?
Yoruichi, can you make the Cannonball?
Huh? I wonder Let me try it.
Dont tell me this is your first try?
Well, put that down there.
Humph!
Something like this is as simple as breathing in and out.
Wow! It took us so long to learn to do it!
Do you resent it?
Do you resent that I could easily do something
that gave you so much trouble to accomplish? Huh?
Ganju.
Were you able to master it?
I guess
Then well go with Flower-Crane Cannon Launch Method Two.
Can you handle it?
Sure!
Dont you chicken out and run off in the middle of it now, damn brat.
Sis
If youre gonna go, youve got to put your life on the line.
Y-Yes!
Are you ready?!
Therell be no more delays, you brats!
Now, get in there!
The sun will be rising soon.
That will be the signal to begin the launching ceremony.
Listen Once were in the Seireitei, we have to stick together.
If you encounter any Captains, dont think, just run.
Our goal is to save Rukia, and nothing else.
Dont, by any means, take any useless risks!
In the distance!
Copper-hued greed desires 36 degrees of dominance!
It has begun! Pour in your spiritual energies!
72 pairs of illusions, 13 pairs of horns,
The monkeys right paw captures a star!
Held in the embrace of 25 suns, the cradle of sand will flow with blood!
Flower-Crane Cannon Launch Method Two!
Kagizaki!
You have done it, Lady Kukaku!
Its a success!
Go with care
Ganju.
Ohh!
There wasnt as much of a shock as I expected.
Idiot Its only the beginning.
Huh?
Huh? Whats that?
Its the next part!
The Flower-Crane Cannon Launch Method Two involves two steps.
The First Spell controls everything from the launch to the directional setting.
The Secondary Spell then controls the acceleration and axis adjustment.
After that, you gradually improve the accuracy!
Oh
Dont get in the way if you want to get there safely.
UhSure!
Theres something I want to tell you all.
In order to enter the Seireitei, we have to stabilize this cannonball.
We must keep the spiritual energy output by each person
at a constant level.
To do that, if you keep your hand on this thing,
youll be able to see how much energy the others are releasing.
I want you to adjust your energy release accordingly.
Right.
Okay.
One mistake and itll be the end. Im counting on you!
I understand.
Yes.
Flower-Crane Cannon Launch Method Two!
Secondary Spell!
Fate of three sparrows, fate of four dragons,
Blocked in from five directions, unable to return six miles,
Wind of the heavens,
Orangutan. Spoons, Cane of elm
K-Kurosaki Youre releasing a little too much!
A-Am I? S-Sorry.
Kurosaki! Lower it some more!
I-I know! Ive lowered it a lot already!
Ichigo
I said I know!
A thousand sprinkles of ash, a thousand bits of wisdom
Ichigo!
The measure of white clouds
I said I know!
Approaching the great darkness,
Not stepping on scarlet shadows
Im turning it down now. Hold on!
A thousand sprinkles of ashes, a thousand bits of wisdom?!
You idiot! You made me read the same line twice!
So what?! Is that supposed to be my fault too?
Youre making so much noise flapping that trap of yours
that I lost my concentration, you numbskull!
Stop it, Ichigo! Ganju
This is no time to be doing that, is it?
Shes right. Stop it!
Stop it, I said!
Stop it, both of you!
Hey Outside
Its Seireitei!
Whats that?!
Urgent alert! Urgent alert! Intruders in Seireitei!
All Squads get into position! Repeat!
Urgent alert! Urgent alert!
Intruders?
Could it be those Ryoka?
Intruders in Seireitei!
Intruders in Seireitei! All Squads get into position!
Hey! Wait, Kenpachi!
Ken-chan!
Yachiru!
What is it? The enemy?
Youre going to kill them?
Yeah. Its the Ryoka!
I dont know how,
but its someone who fought against Ichimaru and survived!
I want to fight him!
There is no choice
This meeting of Squad Captains is dismissed for now.
I shall inform you later how Ichimaru will be dealt with.
All Squads will report immediately to their battle stations!
The warning certainly came at a good time for you.
I dont understand very well
what youre trying to say.
You think you can get away with it?
Youd better nottake me too lightly.
W-What is that?!
I doubt it will be able to get through the Soul Shield Membrane
Ill order everyone to draw back, just in case!
I-Its coming this way!
Get out of here!
Were going to crash!
We have no choice!
Everyone, pour in all the spiritual energy youve got!
It crashed!
It ran into the Shield and stopped!
To crash there and not be destroyed
Could it be a body of spiritual power of such great concentration?
Come on!
W-Whats going on?!
We got through the shield all right
but why arent we falling to the ground?
Dont get separated!
The Cannonball dissolved when it hit the shield
and its only temporarily holding us up!
That means
It will eventually create a whirlpool, then explode and vanish.
Oh!
If we are separated at that time, we will be blown apart by the shock!
Wha-?!
Ohh!
Its begun!
Ohhh!
Damn! Im not gonna get blown away!
Dont come near me!
Go away, if you dont like it!
Will you two cut it out?!
Grab onto whoever is nearest to you! Dont let go, no matter what!
Damn it!
What do you mean by that?!
Let me sit on your shoulder.
Yoruichi!
Ishida!
Chad?!
Chad?!
Chad!
Chad!
C-Chad!
Dont worry. He will surely survive!
But if you want to be able to search for him down there,
you must consider your own safety first!
Damn it!
Ichigo!
Inoue!
Damn They split up into four!
Which one is it?
The strongest one
Which one is it?!
With much appreciation
send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I dont know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move
hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
Youre not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
What's going on?! I'll go and take a look.
But my Zabimaru is gone!
Do you know where it is, Hinamori?
I think someone was using it to slice some pickled radish.
Roar, Zabimaru! Chop up that radish!
Hasn't your character changed a lot, recently?
