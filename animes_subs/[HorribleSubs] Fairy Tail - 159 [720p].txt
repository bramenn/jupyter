Raven Tail...
Molding Magic wizard...
I swear I'll get you both back!
This is the first day of the Grand Magic Games.
The competition part is already over,
with our Fairy Tail B team getting one point for coming in 7th place,
and zero points for coming in last place!
That Rufus guy was totally strong, you know?
Meanwhile, Raven Tail wouldn't stop picking on Fairy Tail,
so they couldn't do proper battle.
The second half of today's Games is the battle part.
Like the name implies, it's a one-on-one showdown.
With the battle part, you get ten points for winning and zero points if you lose.
If it's a draw, each side gets five points.
If we win here, we can still make it to the top!
The Games have just begun!
Do your best, Fairy Tail!
Lucy Versus Flare!
Did you watch the competition part?
Yes, on Lacrima Vision.
The battle part is about to begin...
I'll observe that directly with my own eyes.
It looks like I can expect an unusual harvest this year.
The first match of the first day!
From Fairy Tail A, Lucy Heartfilia!
Versus Flare Corona from Raven Tail!
Blondie...
Lucy! Show her the results of your training!
If you win here, we can still go on!
Kick her ass!
Raven Tail...
They said they hurt Wendy by way of greeting?!
And in the competition, they prioritized interfering with Gray over winning!
I'm angry...
Count on me.
I swear I'll win!
I like that look.
Lucy's really fired up...
It's because her opponent's from Ivan's stupid guild!
Tear her to pieces!
What's wrong, First Master?
I'm wondering what Raven Tail's after...
It's gotta be making us look like imbeciles!
They really know how to get under a guy's skin!
I hope that's all it is...
Apparently, the masters of these two guilds are father and son, Yajima-san!
True, but if they bear the insignia of different guilds,
it doesn't matter if they're parent and child.
It's so dramatic! I'm getting the chills!
Both of you, come forward!
Since this entire area will be your battlefield,
only you two will be in here.
Your time limit is 30 minutes.
B-Blondie...
I'm not gonna lose!
During that time, if you knock out your opponent, you win.
Alright, let the first match...
Here I go!
Gate of the Golden Bull, I open thee! Taurus!
Mooore power!
Oh, my! Celestial Spirit Magic!
And it's one of the 12 Zodiac Gates!
Gate of the Scorpion, I open thee!
Scorpio!
We are!
Here I go!
Two Celestial Spirits at the same time?!
Wow!
Since when has she been able to have two gates open simultaneously?!
Cool!
Sand Buster!
Her hair got longer?!
She's guarding with it?!
Taurus! Use Scorpio's sand!
Moo! Perfect!
Absorb!
Go, Taurus! We!
Sandstorm Axe!
Aldebaran!
The sand's in my eyes!
This is incredible!
Two gates open simultaneously is an amazing spectacle in itself,
but a combination attack, too?!
That girl has improved so much,
you can't even compare her with what she was like seven years ago!
Good job, both of you!
We are!
Blondie!
Hair Dog, Wolf Fang!
Her hair's turned into a wolf!
Her hair?!
Her hair! That bountiful hair! That long hair!
Keep quiet.
Gate of the Crab, I open thee!
Cancer!
My hair...
Nice, Cancer!
When it comes to haircuts, leave it to me-ebi!
You!!
Lucy!
Take that!
My red hair does exactly what I want it to...
Now that you mention it, my Fleuve d'Etoile also...
What?!
Oh, my!
It's only the first match and it's a battle where the fighters barely have time to breathe!
A showdown between father and son guilds! A battle between two women!
And neither of them is backing down!
Although it looks like Fairy Tail is a little more dominant.
Lu-chan!
What the...?!
Hey, look at Lucy's legs!
It's hot...
Can't stand so easily, huh?
My red hair hurt your legs.
That red hair...
It must've been burning through when it had a hold on her!
Hang in there, Lucy!
Stand up!
Dang it! I really liked these boots!
My burning hair... My red hair...
That's all the damage it did?!
Blondie...
I'd say she's off to a good start...
Yeah. She's doing great. Very impressive.
You wouldn't think there was a seven-year period of nothing
when she was sealed away on Tenroujima.
We once fought alongside each other against the Six Generals,
but it's clear that the magic power she had seven years ago
is nothing compared to what she has now.
According to Ichiya-sama,
all of their magic power has increased even more since the Zentopia affair.
But the red-haired girl is no slouch either.
I wonder how she'll attack next...
W-What?! You're aiming for my legs again?!
Now she's barefoot.
If that hair gets a hold of her again, there will be damage.
Be careful, Lucy!
Strange...
This time, I'm not sensing anything...
Where will she attack from?!
What's she doin'?!
Go on! Keep attacking her!
Take that Raven witch down a peg!
Calm down!
Asuka-chan!
Get a hold of yourself!
Stand up dance!
I guess her legs were injured more than we thought?
Don't say anything.
That's an order.
If you disobey,
you know what'll happen, right?
Even a blond bimbo like you can understand.
That's low...
Captain of the Guard,
you've been watching the game from up here?
She's ripening...
Matured fruit is ripening.
It may be accomplished this year.
Just you wait...
What's wrong, Master?
Maybe just my imagination?
I felt something odd...
Blame it on your age.
Easy, easy...
Quiet, you!
Old mustache man!
No one notices.
There's no way they will notice.
If I feel like it, I could take down that brat in an instant...
What kind of a monster is she?!
The breathtaking battle part continues!
It's Lucy Heartfilia versus Flare Corona!
Come to think of it, Yajima-san, when you were in the Council,
Fairy Tail enjoyed a very different reputation than they do today, correct?
They were popular. They were top class when it came to raw power.
Unfortunately, we had a heck of a time with all the problems they caused.
Well, I bet a lot of people here don't know what they were like back then.
How dirty can you get?!
Don't say anything. Don't move. Don't use any magic.
You know what'll happen if you don't obey, right?
Blondie!
Did keeping two gates open at the same time backfire on her?
Is her magic cupboard bare?
She's not naked!
That's not what she means.
Lucy! What's wrong?!
They were neck and neck just before!
Lucy, what about your Celestial Spirits?!
I can't watch! She's getting beaten to a pulp!
Endurance Dance!
Is she conserving magic?
I don't get it, but at this rate...
What happened?!
She's suddenly stopped movin' around!
Get a grip, Blondie!
What in the world is going on?!
What was a fierce battle just moments ago has turned into a one-sided beat down!
Hang in there!
Take that! And that!
Everyone...
Wendy...
Gray...
I'm sorry...
I give up...
Lu-chan!
Maybe she's so hungry she can't move...
Yeah, right!
Who told you it was okay to talk,
Blondie?!
I'm not gonna let you surrender.
I'm just getting started here playing with you.
Understand? Don't say a word.
However...
Now let's see...
What shall I do to you first?
Maybe I'll tear off your clothes in front of all these people...
That would be funny,
but I've just thought of an even better idea!
I'll brand the insignia of Raven Tail onto your body!
A brand that'll never fade away!
Where would you like me to put it?
I see!
You want me to put it right over your Fairy Tail insignia, huh?
Please! Anything but that!
I told you not to talk!
Don't! Anywhere but there!
Lucy's actin' kinda weird!
Where's Natsu?!
He was here a minute ago...
I've got good ears!
I know what I heard!
Asuka-chan, huh?!
Natsu!
What's that doing here?!
What?!
Lucy! Now!
Thank you, Natsu!
Gemini!
Take this!
Do that thing!
We haven't practiced enough!
We don't know if we can do it or not!
Anyway, turn into me!
Roger!
What are you dressed like that for?!
It's not our fault! This is what you had on when we copied you!
I see... Yesterday, right after I got out of the tub...
Don't look!
Blondie!
Wouldn't that Gemini be a powerhouse if it turned into Erza or Laxus?
It can't.
I'm told it can only copy someone with about the same level of magic as its owner, Lu-chan.
I get it. So it'd be impossible to copy Master or the first master...
But it'd probably be able to copy the fourth master, right?
Stow it!
How different are you?!
Well, well! This is a nice happening!
She does have curves in all the right places...
All the right places...
Anyway, what's she planning to do with two of herself?!
B-Bath towel!
Don't share what's on your mind right now!
E-Excited Dance!
That's annoying! Quit your dancing!
In fact, cheer Lucy on properly!
There are now two Lucy Heartfilias!
And one of them is only wearing a bath towel!
Those are the Twins, Gemini, of the Twelve Zodiac Celestial Spirits.
Sound out the heavens, open the heavens...
Stars across the universe,
show yourselves to me
with all your brilliance!
That magic...
I don't believe it...
I see...
She made two of herself to increase her magic power.
Amazing...
So she learned the ultimate magic of the stars!
With the magic power that I have at the moment,
I can't produce the power that I did then, even with two of me...
Tetrabiblos, I am the ruler of the stars.
My aspect is perfection.
W-What is this?!
Open thy savage gate!
This is Fairy Tail!
This is...
88 stars of the heavens...
Open!
The sky filled with stars?!
What is this?!
Urano Metria!
What the...?
What went wrong?
W-What?
What's going on?
Gemini's gone, too.
It all disappeared...?
Obra!
It was you, wasn't it?!
I don't believe it...
Why...?
What happened?!
Her magic disappeared?!
Lucy seemed to be casting a major spell,
but her magic failed?!
Yajima-san, what do you think?
Y-Yajima-san!
Oh, my! Lucy is down for the count!
The match is over!
The winner is Raven Tail's Flare Corona!
There's something fishy about this!
I didn't see that redhead do anything to make the magic disappear...
She had help from outside the ring.
Those jerks cheat!
Ivan!
Are you lookin' for a match outside the arena?!
I win.
That's what you get, Blondie!
You're pathetic! And ugly! And a loser!
What the hell was that, a magic misfire?!
Lame!
So now Raven Tail has 18 points.
Fairy Tail... still has zero points!
Terrible.
If nobody sees it, it's not a breach of the rules.
Nothing could be more cowardly than what they did!
I feel kind of sorry for her...
But they only won by using that kind of foul play as back-up.
Still...
It was a good magic battle!
Don't cry, Lucy.
Well, after all...
Let's save the tears for when we win.
You were great.
Thanks to you, I realized we can fight in this world.
Zero points? That makes it fun, don't ya think?
We're gonna turn it around from this point on.
Yeah!
I'm fired up!
So today's A team match is done, huh?
Now we have to cheer on B team.
I hear Jellal's gonna participate for B team next time!
That guy's tough, so I'm lookin' forward to it!
Nuh-uh, you gotta call him Mystogan!
But on the inside, he's Jellal, right?
If anybody but a Fairy Tail member participates, we'll be disqualified!
And in the first place, he's an escaped convict!
Next time: Bad Omen!
So I'm fightin' against Jela, huh?
That's Jura!
You said that on purpose, didn't you?!
