Is something wrong, Goddess?
No, it's nothing.
He's growing too fast.
I know he had some kind of extraordinary experience, but...
That's not enough to explain this.
It must be because...
Realis Phrase!
In other words, Wallenwhatsit!
Skill effect: quick growth.
As long as his feelings remain, it'll stay in effect.
And the stronger his feelings, the more its effects grow.
Forget your dumb feelings!
Bell, you cheater!
You huge cheater!
But is it okay to tell Bell his real ability scores?
I want to get stronger.
The other gods might be watching, so I can't tell him about his skill, either.
Bell, can I just tell you about your status today?
Oh, sure.
I've decided.
I'm going to give him a push forward!
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Monsterphilia Monster Festival
M-My status has gone up that much?
Yes.
You're growing at an incredible rate right now.
It's like a growth spurt.
Right.
This is just my personal opinion,
but I think you have talent.
You'll become strong, for sure.
And you want to become stronger yourself.
Yes.
I respect your desire.
I'll support you and help you.
I'll lend you my powers.
So promise me you won't be so rash anymore.
Please. Don't leave me alone!
Okay.
I won't do anything rash.
I'll do my best to get stronger,
but I'll never leave you alone, Goddess.
I won't make you worry!
As long as I can hear those words, I feel fine.
And so, Bell,
I'll be gone for a few days, starting tonight.
Is that all right?
Huh?
I'm sorry!
I ran off earlier without paying.
Here's the money.
I'm glad you came came all the way here to pay your bill.
Well, if you didn't come to me, I was going to come to you.
I'm really sorry!
Don't apologize anymore, Bell-san.
I'm happy you came back.
You're going back to the dungeon today, right?
Here, I made you a lunch.
Oh, I couldn't...
Please take it.
Can you not?
Thank you. I'll take it.
Make sure to thank Syr.
The staff here is pretty rough, and that includes me.
We only forgave you because she persuaded us.
I see.
Kid, there's no point in an
adventurer pretending to be something he's not.
When you're just starting out, put all your energy into surviving.
No matter how pathetic you feel, or how people laugh at you,
if you come back alive, you win.
Now that you've made me tell you all this,
I'll never forgive you if you get killed.
Now get going!
We've got work and you're in the way!
Okay!
See you later!
Bye.
I said, See you later, without thinking about it.
Thank you for coming, everyone!
I am Ganesha!
I'm so happy that so many of my colleagues were able to be here tonight!
Hey, how many centuries has it been?
Four days, I think.
That unfortunate-looking guy over there...
Is that Takemikazuchi?
Hermes is here, too.
He's back from his journey?
Hey!
She's here!
The goddess of beauty!
Freya!
She's so wonderful.
And this is what she looks like on the surface, too.
Good evening, Hestia.
Freya.
Am I interrupting?
I just don't like dealing with you.
I love that about you.
Well, I like you better than some...
Hey, Freya!
Shrimp!
Oh, Loki.
What are you doing here?
What, am I not allowed to come here without a reason?
Anyway, this is perfect timing.
Loki, I wanted to ask you something.
You wanted to ask me something, shrimp?
Your familia's sword princess, Wallenwhatsit... is she seeing anybody?
Idiot.
Aiz is my favorite.
If anybody went after her...
I'd rip them apart.
You two are such great friends.
We are not!
Anyway, Loki,
it may be a little late for this but you seem very different today.
I haven't seen you in a dress in forever.
I guess so.
I heard that a certain shrimp was coming to the feast,
so I decided to come laugh at the poor god
who's can't even afford to buy a dress.
That's hilarious.
You came to laugh at me,
when everybody's going to be laughing at you?
What's with your utterly sad...
Flat chest!
Flat chest!
Flat chest!
Everyone's got great equipment...
It's that time of year again, huh?
Monsterphilia?
A year goes by so fast.
Go! Get her! Get her!
Loli-big-boobs and Loki-no-boobs, huh?
I've got 10,000 valis on Loli-big-boobs!
Ten elixirs on no-boobs causing an accident at the last second!
I'll bet all my star chips on me
consoling Loki-tan after she loses!
I'll let you off with that for today!
Next time we meet, don't let me see those tiny things!
Shut up, damn you!
You guys were at it again?
Hephaestus!
I'm so glad I came!
I wanted to see you!
See me?
Listen, I'm not lending you even one more valis, okay?
How rude!
Do I look like someone who'd treat her friends
like walking piggy banks?
Whatever.
You freeloaded off my familia for forever,
and then when we kicked you out you came
crying back and said you had no money, no house, and no job!
So of course I'm going to think that!
Y-Yeah, that's how things used to be, sure.
But things are different now!
I have a familia now, too!
That's right.
Bell, was it?
The human with the white hair and red eyes.
Well, a lot of gods change once they have a familia, but...
Hephaestus, Hestia...
I'll be leaving.
Really?
Yes.
There was something I wanted to check up on...
But that's done.
And I've already had all the fun I wanted with all the men here.
Bye.
Wow.
So, why did you want to see me?
Depending on what it is, I may decide to never speak to you again.
I-I know.
Actually...
I want you to make a weapon for Bell!
Oh, it's you, Bell.
Lord Miach!
Sorry... I know I'm not going to be buying anything.
There's nothing to apologize for.
You didn't go to the Banquet of the Gods, Lord Miach?
Yeah.
I was invited,
but since my familia is so small, I've been busy preparing my goods.
Bell, I'll give you these.
I couldn't.
Don't worry. I'm just brown-nosing a good neighbor.
It's my way of asking you to keep patronizing my familia.
T-Thank you.
Bye.
How long are you going to keep doing that?
I'm actually pretty busy.
You're distracting me.
Do you understand?
You're kidding me.
I'm not trying to brag here,
but you know how much our made-to-order equipment costs, right?
I know it's expensive, but...
Then save up the money.
We can talk then.
It has to be now.
Please, Hephaestus!
I'm begging you!
What exactly are you supposed to be doing, anyway?
Prostrating myself.
Takemikazuchi told me about it.
It's the ultimate technique for apologizing and begging.
He needs to learn to keep his mouth shut.
Hestia.
Tell me why you're willing to go this far.
I want to help Bell!
He's trying to change!
He's found a goal, and now he's trying to follow a long, harsh path.
It's a dangerous path.
So I want the power to help him!
A weapon to cut open the way for him!
He's always been there for me, and I can't do anything for him.
He gives me everything, and I do nothing for him.
I'm his god, but I can't do any of the things a god should do.
I hate not being able to do anything!
Trying to change, huh?
Fine.
I'll make your weapon.
For your child's sake.
Thank you, Hephaestus!
Just so we're clear, you're paying.
Even if it takes decades, or centuries.
Yeah! I know!
What kind of weapon does your child use?
He uses a knife.
Hephaestus, are you going to make it yourself?
Of course.
I can't get my familia involved in a private matter between you and I.
Wow! Even in heaven, you're known as the Divine Smith!
And you're going to make it for me personally!
Did you forget?
This isn't heaven.
We can't use any of my divine powers.
I don't care.
The thing that makes me happiest is that you're the one who's making it.
You help me, too!
You're going to be my assistant.
Sure, leave it to me.
A first-rate weapon for a new adventurer,
with only two weeks' experience...
Now then, what to do?
She said she'd be gone for two or three days.
Maybe she won't come home today...
Hey!
Wait up, white-hair!
I have a request!
Oh, good morning.
G-Good morning.
So what I want is for you to give this wallet to that airhead Syr.
Um...
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand, still.
Anya.
That's not a good enough explanation.
Mister Cranel is confused.
You're so dumb, Ryuu.
He can understand that I want him to take Syr her wallet,
which she forgot when she skipped out on
her shift and went to Monsterphilia.
That's the situation.
I see.
Syr, of course, did not skip out on her shift.
She took a vacation day for the festival.
She's probably in trouble without her wallet.
Please help, Mister Cranel.
Please!
Alright.
Leave it to me.
So um...
What's Monsterphilia?
Monsterphilia is a huge festival held once a year by the Ganesha familia!
They take over the coliseum for a full day,
and tame monsters brought from
the dungeon in front of the whole crowd.
It's a really hardcore spectacle, more or less.
What are you planning now?
Did you take a liking to some familia's child again,
and decide to go after them?
Jeez...
All you're doing it sowing the seeds of conflict,
you sex-obsessed goddess.
It's done.
Hooray! Hooray!
Thank you, Hephaestus!
Can I go give it to Bell?
That's fine,
but don't forget about the loan.
Yeah!
So which child is it you're after?
A child who's so terribly forlorn, he'd cry at the slightest provocation.
But he was so pretty.
Ethereal, almost.
A color I'd never seen before...
It was truly a coincidence that I saw him.
He just happened to wander into my field of vision.
What's wrong?
Sorry.
I have somewhere to be.
You can't just
Let's meet again later.
What's her problem?
Wait, she left me with the bill, too?
What's wrong, Aiz?
Nothing.
Wow.
It's just like they said!
It looks like it'll be hard to find Syr...
Bell!
Goddess!
What are you doing here?
I missed you, I guess!
I missed you, too.
Splendid!
I knew it! You and I share an incredible bond!
Um, Goddess... What...?
Let's go on a date, Bell!
Wait, Goddess!
I've been asked to find someone!
Oh, yeah?
Then let's look for them while we go on our date!
Two birds with one stone!
No, I can't...
Mister, give us two crepes!
Sure thing!
Goddess...
Say, Ahh, Bell!
Goddess, I can't
What?
You don't want to take a bite after me?
It's not that!
I can't take your food from you, Goddess.
Eat mine instead!
You decided to run away, huh?
Well, that's okay.
I'd like you to wipe that off.
Okay.
You're perfect.
It's no good...
I planned to simply watch his growth for a while, but...
So it's a girl you're looking for, huh?
I can't take my eyes off you for a second, Bell.
What does that mean?
Who knows?
Goddess?
A monster!
A monster?
Chase after little me!
B-B-Bell, is it looking at me?
Goddess, why is that monster chasing you?
Do you know him?
I've never met him before!
This is... Daedalus Street?
We have to go!
Bell!
Goddess!
I'm scared.
I'm scared, but...
I'm a man!
Go!
Go!
Don't run and leave that girl behind!
Bell!
Goddess!
It's no good.
I'm not strong enough to protect her!
At this rate it'll catch up to us!
What do I do?
What do I do?
Bell?
I'm sorry, Goddess.
I'll buy you some time.
You should run away.
What are you saying?
Open this door, now!
Goddess...
I don't want to lose any more family.
Bell!
Bell!
Bell!
