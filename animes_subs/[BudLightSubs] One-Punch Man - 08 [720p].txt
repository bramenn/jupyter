Humans!
If you wish not for annihilation, take heed!
I bear a message from the depths!
You will surrender the surface to us, the Clan of the Seafolk!
Thereafter you shall become our nourishment, human scum
Nice head! Are you related to an octopus by any chance?
I heard it was that same guy again.
What was his name?
I forget, but he's super-strong.
HE TAKES EVERY OPPONENT OUT WITH A SINGLE PUNCH.
BUT PEOPLE SAY HE STEALS OTHERS' CREDIT.
I MEAN, HE'S CLASS C.
Class C?
Never seen him before.
I've got to keep up.
THE DEEP SEA KING
Help! Somebody!
We, the Clan of the Seafolk, now rule the surface!
It is useless to resist!
You'll pay for that, human!
The Class A hero Stinger,
rising in popularity and currently 11th in the rankings, is here to help.
At your service, everyone!
It's Stinger!
We're saved!
Go for it!
Well now
Anyone who needs a new blowhole drilled into their torso, step right up!
Master
You have moved up to rank 2 in Class C.
You are on the verge of entering Class B!
Class B, huh?
That means I won't have any more weekly hero quotas, right?
Correct.
Oh, excuse me
Hello?
City J? It is a bit far.
Are there no competent heroes nearby?
Busy guy
Master!
The monster you defeated on your way home the other day
called itself one of the Seafolk, right?
I forget.
Several monsters calling themselves the Clan of the Seafolk
have appeared in City J and are attacking anyone in sight.
A Class A hero fighting them all alone and on the brink of defeat.
His extreme fatigue and pain are apparent
A prompt response from the Hero Association
is desperately needed.
Hang on!
The threat level is Tiger.
All citizens are asked to stay out of the area.
You've got spunk, you slimy bastards.
My beloved Bamboo Shoot here
is happy to be battling enemies with some grit for a change.
But it's time to end this.
You can quit your boasting, human!
Your foolish fan club has run off.
But your death will not be easy.
For the taking of our brothers' lives, long will we cause you to suffer.
Four fish to go!
It's a lot easier without an audience!
Sing, Bamboo Shoot!
Gigantic Drill Stinger Quadruple Thrust!
I did it
I did it!
These monsters were probably a God-level threat
and I defeated them all by my
You know, when something's so annoying,
it is a pleasure to watch it die.
How much farther is City J?
We are almost there.
But I am getting no readings.
I will scout ahead.
Once I have confirmed their location, I will let you know.
Ohhey!
This is an announcement from the Hero Association.
The threat level is Tiger.
All citizens, please stay clear of the area.
CITY A - HERO ASSOCIATION HQ
Was the warning issued?
The request just went out.
We'll need to update it and re-issue.
What do you mean?
Stinger is down.
Mumen Rider here. I'm heading in.
Give me the location.
All lines are busy at this time
Where are they? Hey, best forget it!
Class C heroes can't handle this one.
Huh? The word just came down.
Emergency evacuation warning.
The threat level has been raised from Tiger to Demon.
All residents of City J, See what I mean?
please evacuate immediately.
Hey!
I repeat. All residents of City J, please evacuate immediately.
Evacuate?
How foolish.
As if I'd allow even one of these apes to escape.
So that's the one that got Stinger
But he's the last of'em.
Should I wait for backup?
If it's one-on-one, maybe I can
That smarts.
Why would you do this?
Dammit, how'd he get behind me?
I was so surprised my voice went all funky.
Plus, my gunpowder-charged lightning kick had zero effect!
I can't win.
Who are you?
I am
Lightning Max, the hero
Fight me.
Fight you? Of course.
I'll run for it as soon as
What happened?
I can't feel my body
Dammit.
You arrogant
Lightning Flying Backwards Roundhouse Kick!
Class S hero,
Puri-puri Prisoner.
I escaped from prison just to see you!
Well, well.
A hero serving time in prison?
I tagged along and was able to escape too.
My thanks.
Prisoner number 4188, Sonic, right?
Surprised I know?
You see, I check up on all the boys who catch my eye.
I'm serving a life sentence because I can't resist attacking beautiful men.
Oh my.
More soldiers come for me?
Goodness!
I feel the strength about to erupt out of him!
Sonic, dear, you hang back.
Class A rank 11, sweet Stinger.
Class A rank 20, Lighting Max.
I fancied them both.
And yet you ruined them!
Now that Genos has passed me, I am the lowest in rank
but I am still Class S!
I am unlike either of them.
I'll begin at half-power, to gauge how much you can take.
You made me rip the hand-knit sweater my boyfriend made!
I will never, ever forgive you!
A delectable slab of meat, quite prime.
My appetite's up!
Huh?
Oh my
I felt that
just a little.
I felt that tooa little.
Puri-puri Prisoner is acting tough, but he's hurting
So this is what a fight between a demon-level monster
and a Class S hero looks like?
It's almost comical.
Neither one could defeat me.
Dammit His punch was stronger than I expected.
But I must not lose to him.
I can't have any more of my boys destroyed by this monster
I have no choice.
I'll have to transform.
Ready
Transform!
Puri-puri Prisoner Angel Style!
He's naked.
And he's definitely no angel.
Nor is he human.
Nor do I want to watch.
I'm out.
No one has ever seen my Angel Style and lived to tell about it.
All the more reason to leave.
Quite unsightly.
Are thoseyour last words?
Angel Rush!
Elevated energy levels nearby.
That must be it.
Damn it! I have no way to reach Master!
It cannot be helped.
Done with your combo?
I felt thata little.
Hear me.
The objective of a combination move is to finish your opponent.
Each separate attack must be delivered with intent to kill.
Like this.
Isn't this fun?
Just who are you?
I am the Deep Sea King.
As lord of the Clan of the Seafolk, this world is mine to rule.
Do you dare defy me too?
You think you have the strength to rule the surface all alone?
That's pathetic.
Oh?
Then I suppose you must die.
That's my line.
I would have let you live if you'd shown me the respect I'm due.
I'm no hero, but I will eliminate you.
The rainis falling.
Too slow.
Wind Blade Leg!
Deep Sea King, I see right through your moves.
Are you sure of that?
Once it bites, my little moray here never lets go!
Let me be clear.
There's no way I'd ever lose to you.
It's useless.
You may have power
but you're too slow to fight me.
I'm glad, Deep Sea King!
Fighting something like you just confirms how strong I really am!
You see, my moves are the fastest and the strongest!
Now what, lost your mind?
He's faster!
Stronger too?!
What happened to him?
He's huge!
The air of the surface shriveled me up a bit,
but thanks to this rain, I feel like myself again.
Your attacks don't hurt me even a little!
At this time,
the whereabouts of the Seafolk that attacked City J are unknown.
Several heroes who tried to stop them
have been found unconscious at the scene
and remain in critical condition.
Of all the times to hit a red light
Where'd he run off to?
Wait, you're
Class C, rank 2.
You a hero too?
Have you seen Genos?
Genos?
Today, as our guest, we have the top-ranked, Class A superhero
who has also been number one in popularity rankings
for 28 weeks straight.
He's also a successful model, actor and singer.
Thank you for having me.
We are currently facing a threat level of Demon.
How do you assess the situation?
That is a difficult question.
Why is that?
I'm only a hero when I confront evil.
The rest of the time, I'm focused on my career as an artist.
I see.
I'm only here today to promote my new song.
My apologies.
In that case, let's discuss your song.
Let me just say this.
To assuage the public's fears and worries,
heroes need to be both tough and strong
so that they can defeat evil with speed, grace, and brilliance.
I find it regrettable that there were heroes
who were completely beaten by evil this time.
So that no hero ever dies in vain,
I hope each will continue to train his hardest.
My attacks have no effect.
Could I be lacking in power?
I can't kill him unarmed.
I need to retreat for now and find a weapon.
Caught you!
Crack crack, snap snap.
Huh?
Wait there.
The next time we meet will be your demise.
No matter.
The small fry can be let go.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
There were orders to evacuate.
A hero?
If you're after the Deep Sea King, better forget it.
Deep Sea King?
You heroes could all jump him at once and still lose.
You're fine at playing make-believe,
but against true power you don't stand a chance.
You can't protect a thing.
Who was that pervert?
The Seafolk?!
I sense numerous life signals nearby.
With so many
The evacuation shelter!
Daddy, are the scary monsters still outside?
Don't worry. As long as we're in this shelter, we're safe.
Besidesif it comes down to it,
I'm sure all of us together can beat a monster or two.
I sense them
Yes, so many!
It's coming from...
over there!
Greetings
and goodbye.
Please wait!
We surrender!
We will comply with any demands you have.
But please do not attack. I beg you.
I'm only Class C, so I evacuated. Now I'm trapped.
I'm no hero. I'm a failure
Surrender?
I've come to kill you. Your deaths are inevitable!
And as for my demands
How about I demand you scream nicely as I slaughter you?
I can't win
I know it won't amount to much,
but all I can do is buy time for the Class S heroes to get here.
But look at this monster
Who am I kidding?
I can't buy time just by talking to him.
I pissed my pants
I'm pathetic.
I'll fight with you!
Heroes?
There are others in here too?
I may be the lowest ranking at 38,
but I'm still a Class A hero.
We can do this.
I-I'm a hero too!
Allback-man is here!
Heroes?
The heroes are here?
Heroes!
They'll save us!
I feel better with a Class A around.
Yeah
Two Class C's, one Class B and one Class A
We can do it!
We can win!
You sure this is the way?
Yes, since residents are fleeing from this direction,
we'll find monsters further up.
Did you see a butt naked guy run past?
What?
Maybe he was taking a bath and was left behind.
I'll check it out.
Go on without me.
Got it!
Mumen Rider here.
Yes, we're on our way.
What! The shelter?
It was the other way!
All right. When I give the signal, charge him.
One
Two
That's weird. I know I saw him
Why so quiet all of a sudden?
Are you one of the Seafolk?
Mumen Rider went in?
Yes. I couldn't stop
Mumen Rider?!
What's your location?
This is beyond you.
The monster even took out a Class S hero!
We need to assemble a subjugation squad.
A Class S hero was defeated?
Who is this?
Where's Mumen Rider?
Stand-up Peddling Mode!
Roar, Justice!
Is this the Hero Association?
Yes. Who are you?
Give me the owner of that cell phone right now!
This is the hero Saitama.
Saitama?
NEXT EPISODE: UNYIELDING JUSTICE Hey, how'd you like my Gigantic Drill Stinger?
NEXT EPISODE: UNYIELDING JUSTICE By the way, I nailed ten of those Seafolk things!
You're pretty upbeat.
Oh, Lightning Max?
I won't ask how many Seafolk you defeated,
but I'm sure you did great.
Next time on One-Punch Man: Episode 9,
Unyielding Justice.
I'm not sure who'll mete it out,
but make sure our sacrifices weren't in vain!
