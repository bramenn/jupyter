Outdated magics from the dark ages of history are quickly falling out of relevance in today's world.
Antiquated magics bearing a dark history will find their place in our world quickly disappearing.
I firmly believe that magic must reinvent itself to still have a place in our times.
It is my belief that magic must modernize to keep its relevance in our times.
allowing it to use magic even when out of range of a Sorcerer's Stone.
Did you invent all of this yourself, Professor Croix?
She has garnered acclaim for her magic development at a young age.
Despite her youth, she has many achievements regarding magic development.
She had an unmatched passion for magic which surely underlied some greater goal she wished to accomplish.
She may have been somewhat more reserved back then, though.
But back then, she gave off a more subdued impression.
I should be going now.
Ah, so busy. It's hard being a common teacher.
Ursula... Ursula Calliste...
Come on, why? She's totally the best! Witches have gotta get with the times!
No way, are you crazy? Witches have gotta get with the times!
Thanks to the Sorcery-thingamajig she made, we'll be able to magic even off school grounds!
There's an article about Professor Croix's history.
she received various awards including the Golden Ash Prize and title of Moonlit Witch.
Chariot's grades, by contrast, were always in the gutter.
But Chariot's grades were always in the gutter.
I do admit that Chariot had a natural sense for magic.
However, she neglected her studies,
In contrast, Croix was viewed as carrying the future of magic on her...
This is amazing, check it out!
She called it a computer!
To think that she's been taken in by this magic science nonsense in the last decade...
You're the first person I've heard praise Chariot since I've come here, so I'm getting a bit emotional.
You're the first person I've heard praise Chariot since I got here, so I just got kind of emotional.
Everyone says that she went down the wrong path and stuff.
Chariot du Nord loved visually appealing and sensational magic.
It earned her the scorn of more orthodox witches.
As for me, I do not care for such dated preconceptions.
But I prefer not to be bound by old predispositions.
What she did was meaningful, regardless of whether the results were tangible or not.
Her role was not insignificant, regardless of the results of her actions.
Professor Croix, you're the best!
If you have anything that might be connected to her, I could try to analyze it with my magic science.
I'll be able to analyze it there, this rod of... something.
I'll be able to analyze it there. Your... rod of something?
Shiny Rod! I'll bring it for sure!
Yes, it has.
Why did the Shiny Rod react to you,
Let me take a look.
I'll discover it for you.
Ten years ago you shed the name of Shiny Chariot.
but it seems you've retained a bit more of it than I had expected.
but it seems you've kept a bit more than I thought.
Though all of it was within expected parameters considering what I knew
You haven't changed one bit, not in the least how you want everything for yourself!
You, however, have changed. There's hardly a shadow of your former self left.
But you have changed. You're hardly a shadow of your former self.
In any case, regardless of what I'm plotting, you're powerless to stop me, Chariot.
And about the power to change the world, the world reconstruction magic, Grand Triskelion,
Yggdrasil's branches shrouded the entire world.
Its branches held even the stars and planets.
But that power faded with time.
The great age of magic reached its end.
Only traces of it remain within the leylines.
Only a small amount remains within the leylines.
But that power was passed down in secret.
Grand Triskelion?
It's written using the luna alphabet.
The ancient witches created it from the moon and the stars.
When the one reciting... breathes life?
Its meaning is strive for a place of idylls.
Those who try to achieve their dreams must proceed through struggles.
There may come times when you struggle and fail and lose sight of that dream.
There may be times you continue failing and lose sight of that dream.
And the third you recited at the Samhain Festival.
When you grow by your own power and have breathed life into all seven Words,
the seal on the Grand Triskelion will be broken.
Outdated magics burdened by their dark history are quickly falling out of relevance in today's world.
I firmly believe that magic must reinvent itself to retain its place in our times.
For instance, take this leyline router.
Those are leylines.
Equipping a broom with this leyline router will automatically couple it with a leyline,
Wow, amazing!
allowing the use of magic even outside the range of a Sorcerer's Stone.
Did you come up with all of this by yourself, Professor Croix?
Of course. I am the sole developer.
You're a genius!
Now then, activate your leyline routers and begin the simulation.
Isn't it incredible?
Damn, it's awesome!
Magic and science can actually go together!
Take action!
Take action!
Raise your hands!

Oh, if it isn't Diana.
Are you doing more research? You're always so dedicated.
I was reading through the registers, hoping to learn more about Professor Croix.
About Professor Croix?
It appears she was an excellent student.
She garnered acclaim for her magic development despite her young age.
Her thesis on the conversion of magic energy is particularly innovative.
That's right, Diana. She was a prodigy who could rival even you.
Her unmatched passion for magic was surely inspired by some greater goal she wished to accomplish.
But back then, she gave the impression of a rather reserved person.
Were you personally acquainted with Professor Croix?
Sh-She was famous among all the students.
We weren't all that close, but I heard of her exploits often.
OhI should be going now.
Not a quiet minute in the day! Being a run-of-the-mill teacher sure is demanding...
Ursula... Ursula Callistis...
Her target must be the revived Claiomh Solais.
Croix...
Professor Croix is the best!
Strong, smart, and beautiful!
I've never seen a teacher like her before!
Oh yeah? Modern magic, was it?
Ain't this a pain in the ass?
You're crazythis is the best! Witches have gotta get with the times!
The future is now!
The future, huh...
But then there'd be no difference between magic and science.
Thanks to the Sorcery-thingamajig she made, we'll be able to use magic even off school grounds!
There's an article on Professor Croix's past here.
New professor Croix Meridies graduated from Luna Nova ten years ago.
Praised as a'prodigy' during her student years due to her exceedingly high marks,
she received various awards, including the Golden Ash Prize and the title of Moonlit Witch.
Moonlit Witch?! That's just like Chariot!
So Professor Croix was here at the same time as Chariot.
I wonder if they were rivals!
Girls, you shouldn't be playing with those toys here.
Professor, were the two of them rivals?
Not in the slightest.
Croix and Chariot were nowhere near the same level back then.
Croix worked hard and put in the effort to improve her magic.
On the other hand, Chariot's grades were always in the gutter.
I will admit that Chariot had a natural sense for magic.
However, in addition to neglecting her studies,
she even committed the sin of using our sacred magic for her frivolous entertainment shows.
Now the public's got the wrong impression of magic, and her reputation among witches couldn't be worse.
In stark contrast to her,
Croix was seen as carrying the torch of magic into the future...
This is amazing! You need to check this out!
The site's got another eyewitness account on it.
No way, it's still flying around?
Just look!
Wow, !
Ladies.
You are forbidden to use computers outside of the classroom.
Okay.
She called it a computer!
To think that she's adopted this magic science nonsense over the last decade...
I couldn't be more disappointed.
Huh?
Akko?
Professor Croix!
I didn't know you were Chariot's upperclassman!
Shiny Chariot!
Yes, I remember her. She called herself Chariot du Nord back in those days.
She was a charming witch with the ability to attract the attention of everyone around her even as a child.
You're the first person I've heard praise Chariot since I got here, so I'm getting a bit emotional.
They all say she went down the wrong path and stuff...
Chariot du Nord loved the sensational and eye-popping kind of magic.
It earned her the scorn of the more orthodox witches.
But I prefer not to be bound by such dated preconceptions.
What she did was meaningful, regardless of the results of her actions.
Professor Croix, you really are the best!
Do you know why Chariot disappeared, or where she is now?
Are you really that interested in her?
I want to meet her so that I can thank her for giving me a dream and changing my life!
If you have anything that might be connected to her, I could try analyzing it with my magic science.
Something connected to her?
Like for example...
The Shiny Rod! I have Chariot's staff!
I found it in Arcturus Forest!
In Arcturus Forest?
I'll go get it!
Hold on, Akko.
I don't have the necessary equipment in this classroom.
Meet me in the New Moon Tower after school.
In the New Moon Tower?
My laboratory is there.
I'll be able to analyze it there, your... rod of something.
The Shiny Rod! I'll bring it for sure!
Oh, Professor.
Is Akko here?
She went to the New Moon Tower earlier.
The New Moon Tower?
I think Professor Croix asked her to bring the Shiny Rod or something.
Akko's in danger!
Where's Professor Croix's laboratory?
Will you lead me there?
I brought the Shiny Rod! Please analyze it!
Put it down there. I'll analyze it.
Oh, sure.
It appears the Shiny Rod reacts to high levels of spirit energy.
What does that mean?
Its magic activates in response to synchronization with the wielder's emotional energy.
So, um...
In the past, it reacted to Chariot's heart. And now...
And now?
Has the Shiny Rod ever reacted to your emotions?
Y-Yes, it has.
Why does the Shiny Rod react to you,
and what situations cause it to activate?
Let me take a look for you.
I want to be like Chariot!
I'll become an amazing witch and touch the hearts of people around the world!
A believing heart is my magic!

Akko!
Vega Varulus!
Belga Veeda!
Quite a few years have passed since last we met, Chariot du Nord.
You were testing my powers, Croix!
Ten years ago, you shed the name of Shiny Chariot.
I had presumed your powers would have weakened considerably,
but it seems you've retained a bit more than I had expected.
Akko!
What have you done to Akko?!
I simply collected some data.
Though it was all within expected parameters, considering what I learned
from secretly observing her over the past several months.
I couldn't glean anything worthwhile.
I have a pretty good idea of why you returned to Luna Nova now.

You, however, have changed. You're hardly a shadow of your former self.
To think I was once blinded by your brilliance.
In any case, regardless of what it is that I'm plotting, you're powerless to stop me, Chariot.
No, I suppose I should call you Professor Ursula now.
Have you revealed your secret to her?
Even if I can never shine again...
I will protect Akko!
Akko...
Akko...
Professor... Ursula?
Huh? Wasn't I in Professor Croix's laboratory?
You started to feel sick, so I brought you back here.
I was... having a dream.
Like Chariot was talking about something...
Reconstruction magic or something...
I've been meaning to speak to you about it eventually.
About the true meaning behind why the Shiny Rod revealed itself to you.
And about the power to change the world inherent in the world reconstruction magic, Grand Triskelion,
and what that magic actually does.
Only the Nine Olde Witches know everything.
The origin of the Grand Triskelion dates back several thousand years.
Back then...
Yggdrasil's branches encompassed the entire world.
Its branches held even the stars and planets in place.
It was from there that witches drew their infinite magic.
But its power withered with time.
Its decline signaled the end of the great age of magic.
Only traces of it remain as what we now call the leylines.
But that original power was passed down in secret.
The Nine Olde Witches sealed it within Arcturus.
That itself is the magic which can reconstruct the world
Grand Triskelion.
Grand Triskelion?
We know that only the revival of the seven Words may break its seal.
Those are the seven Words.
It's written in the Luna script.
I can't read it at all.
The ancient witches learned it from the moon and stars.
There are hardly any witches who can read it now.
The seven Words have been lost for a long time.
Simply reciting them will not activate it.
Only when the one reciting it breathes life into their revival will the magic be released.
When the one reciting... breathes life into them?
You have already revived three of the Words.
I have?
Do you remember the day you arrived at Luna Nova?
You breathed life into the first Word.
If I reach out, it's sure to begin!
Thrilling and exciting, my very own story!
Noctu... Orfei!
Aude Fraetor!
That was the first Word?
Its meaning is strive for your ideal place.
Those who try to achieve their dreams must go through hardships.
There may come times when you fail and lose sight of that dream.
But you must never let the flame in your chest go out.
Burn that flame bright, and strive for your ideal place.
That is what it means.
Noctu Orfei Aude Fraetor.
The second was at Blue Moon Abyss.
That which is dreamed cannot be grasped.
But work towards it, day after day, and you will find it in your hands!
Phaidoari Afairrynghor.
And the third you recited at the Samhain Festival.
Open your heart!
Let's laugh together!
Arae Aryrha!
You and the Shiny Rod revived the lost Words.
I did?
There are four Words remaining.
Four... what do they mean?
That is for you to learn for yourself.
Do you know them, Professor?
All except for the very last.
When you will have grown by your own power and breathed life into all seven Words,
the seal on the Grand Triskelion will break.
I see... so that's why.
Professor, I finally got it!
Chariot!
Chariot's been searching for the Words!
That must be why she disappeared!
If I keep chasing after the Words too, I know I'll run into her!
I'll find them! All seven Words!
