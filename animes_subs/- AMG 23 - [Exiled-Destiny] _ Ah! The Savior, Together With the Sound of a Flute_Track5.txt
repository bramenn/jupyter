Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
System error?
What did you say?
Yggdrasil's self-defense functions...
The energy transfer system is down!
Put the sub-system into backup mode! Rebooting the main system!
It's no good.
The massive gravitational pulse observed earlier...
Impossible... how could this be happening?
At this rate, Yggdrasil will soon be vulnerable to attack.
Due to the effects of a gravitational pulse on Earth...
Combat Division, prepare for an attack on the demons in defense of Yggdrasil!
Repeat, Combat Division...
Do you understand the plan of action?
Yes.
Urd has unleashed her demonic powers, and become the Lord of Terror.
Unless we take action now...
So I must defeat Urd before that happens...
Can you do it?
If defeating her is my duty...
That power surge...it couldn't be...
Ah! The Savior of the World Arrives with the Sound of the Flute?
Unrestricted, the power of a 1st class goddess...
If I were to remove the seal on that power...
Big Sister, breaking your seal without permission is a huge offense!
And also a chance of saving Keiichi...
You might not even get away with just a license revocation!
My sealed power...
Return to me!
In a flash of light!
Big Sister...
Belldandy has dared to break her power seal.
I'm putting the attack on hold for now.
1st class goddess, special duty category, Lind...
You are to remain in combat mode. Stand by until you receive new orders.
Understood.
I just hope that this can resolve everything.
Even at full power, I'm still being jammed.
That's what's keeping me from locating Urd and the others.
But the moment she uses her powers, there should be a gravitational pulse.
As long as I don't miss that moment, I should be able to find her.
Both Keiichi and Urd...
I'm going to save them no matter what.
Please have mercy on me!
Oh, shut up.
Just take your medicine and think about how you messed up!
You demon!
Really...
Thanks to your incompetence as a servant...
Listen, Urd!
If you don't cut it out, you'll be in big trouble! Wake up, for crying out loud!
Wake up, did you say?
That's right...
I've awakened all right... to who I really am!
Don't tell me you're going to use the Ultimate Destruction Program...
Ultimate Destruction Program?
I'm saved!
Hey, servant, what's this Ultimate Destruction Program?
Uh...well...I've never heard of it before, either.
Darn, so they didn't know about it.
Then why don't I just ask him directly by scanning his mind?
My power shall connect your mind with my mind...
Two minds on a date!
I'll die before I tell you anything!
Don't tell me he can throw up a mind shield?
Come to think of it, I don't know much about it, either.
If that's the case, you should've told me!
You made me use unnecessary power.
Code confirmed!
I will now proceed to explain the Ultimate Destruction Program.
Explanation of the program's operation.
First...
The Ultimate Destruction Program was...
In other words, it will lead to the annihilation of all human life on Earth.
I don't believe this! Picking such an uninspired place to meet me!
If you're going to make me wait, at least pick a 5-star restaurant or a swanky bar!
You could've been more thoughtful!
'Famous loyal dog' or not, making me wait in front of some pooch's statue...
Who in the world do you think you are?
Now what do I do?
How's he going to find me now?
How am I doing so far?
Well done! You must accurately bring down 52 buildings.
The Ultimate Destruction Program is...
Once you've cracked them all, this world will become a realm of darkness!
You'd never...would you?
You bet I would!
I'm going to destroy this world and rebuild it into a Dark Realm for demons.
The urn!
Yes, my Lord. The urn!
All right, the first layer of protection has been removed. What's next?
Don't be impatient. The Night of Terror is still young!
Our time will come soon enough.
I've found her! Urd!
Big Sister!
Keiichi! Urd!
I'm coming.
Why?
Why am I always the one who gets left behind?
Lord Urd! You've done it! The stars have vanished!
This means I've successfully completed the second process, right?
At this rate, the world will...
Keiichi...
Just stay very still, right where you are...
Belldandy...
All right, what do I do next?
What the...
Holy Bell!
Belldandy!
Just one shot...
If that urn is the catalyst, things should go back to normal once it's destroyed...
Wind Arrow!
Very clever!
Shield!
What the...
Curses! You removed your power limiter!
Yes.
If the urn is broken, the spell should be lifted.
Belldandy!
Keiichi, everything will be all right now.
Now then, let's go home together, the 3 of us.
You're the only older sister I have in the world...
That was brilliant, Belldandy! You couldn't have done it better.
Everything has happened as planned.
From making you sense Urd's presence, to having you destroy me.
But, no...
Now that I've been destroyed at the hands of a goddess...
Now then, Lord of Terror!
Let us now transform this world into a Realm of Darkness!
No! Wait!
It can't be...it's all my fault...
Behind you! Shield!
Belldandy!
She's out of my way at last!
And now it's finally mine to use as I wish...
Go, Fenrir!
Go forth and feast on the people's suffering!
Burn it all down! Destroy everything in your sight, Fenrir!
And once you've trampled the earth to ruins...
Don't you think you might be going a little too far?
Belldandy!
Belldandy!
Belldandy! Belldandy! Belldandy!
Man, can't he shut up? Belldandy! Belldandy! Belldandy!
This is the best part, for crying out loud!
Urd, aren't you even a little worried about Belldandy?
You may be the Lord of Terror, but you are still sisters with half the same blood!
True, half of the blood in my veins is the same blood that runs in Belldandy's.
However...
Now that I've awakened as the Lord of Terror...
There is no justice but destruction!
This world has no need for goddesses!
Belldandy...what am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to find Big Sister and the others?
Huh?
What's a cell phone doing in a place like this?
Uh...hello?
It is I.
The Almighty?
I can see there's much turmoil down there.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Urd...
I am willing to overlook both that and the fact Belldandy unsealed her powers.
Your priority now is to stop the program from executing.
Do you mean that...
The Lord of Terror unlocked the seal on the Ultimate Destruction Program.
The program is now running with the objective of creating a Demon Realm.
But, no...
As things stand, the Lord of Terror's descent has triggered...
Even if I were to deploy the Combat Division, only one could get through now.
Combat Division? Don't tell me... you'd do that to Urd!?
I'd like to avoid that myself.
But it will be my last resort.
I am now going to send you the vaccine for the Ultimate Destruction Program.
Ultimate Destruction Program vaccine?
A flute?
Deliver that to Belldandy.
The program will be nullified by the pure melody of that flute...
But I don't know where I'm supposed to go...
Almighty One...thank you!
That spirit I just felt now...
That was the spirit of the Urd I know.
If I use all my powers to create a barrier field, I still have a chance of saving her.
My sister wasn't the Lord of Terror after all.
Holy Bell!
So you're going to help me, too?
Thank you.
All right, then, let's go.
Wind Cage!
Lord of Terror, what should we do with this fellow?
True, now that we've gotten rid of Belldandy, he's of no use to us.
Why don't we feed him to Fenrir?
You shall be offered as a living sacrifice for the coming Demon Realm!
Take him, Fenrir!
But this is the Wind Cage spell!
I've sealed the Ultimate Destruction Program's life-form.
Belldandy!
You may have unsealed your powers...
I know I sensed Urd's spirit just now.
If her spirit was driven out by negative energy, the opposite must be possible.
Please, Urd, free yourself from that negative energy!
You think you can take me in that weakened state?
Belldandy!
What was that supposed to prove?
I've had mosquito bites that were more painful!
It's no good. There's just too much negative energy.
I don't have enough power right now to create a reversal effect!
Hey, servant.
Give your powers to Fenrir.
Huh?
You're going to give Fenrir a power- boost so he can break that barrier field.
But if I do that, I won't survive...
Never fear...
Your accomplishments as my servant will be celebrated...
Oh, so I have to die for that?
If I do as she says, I'm really going to get killed.
The hell I will!
You're so spineless!
Marller!
Fine, then.
I'll just give him a power-boost with my own energy!
Fenrir! I am endowing you with my power!
But why?
He's absorbing my power in unlimited quantities...I can't control it!
Urd!
What's the matter with you, Urd?
Impossible...
Are you okay?
Hey!
Belldandy!
Are you all right?
Thank goodness, Keiichi...you're safe!
How could you be so reckless?
Because if I lose you...
That's why...
It's the same for me, you know. If I lose you, I don't know what...
So you have to promise me not to push your luck anymore.
All right.
Urd!
The emblem on her forehead is going back to the way it was before.
All the negative energy's been driven out of Urd's body...
Fenrir!
Not Fenrir...
I am the one who will lead this world into darkness...I'm the Lord of Terror!
Impossible! You're the life-form of the Ultimate Destruction Program.
That's right.
I am the Ultimate Destruction Program.
And now that I've absorbed all of Urd's negative energy...
Thanks to you, I have awakened at last.
You still intend to put up a fight?
You actually think you can take me on with the little power that you have left?
If it means saving the world... and saving Keiichi...
I can see that you're prepared... very well, sacrifice yourself!
Skuld!
Sorry to keep you waiting, Big Sister! This is for you!
What is it?
It can't be...
Yes, it is! That flute is the Ultimate Destruction Program vaccine!
It's Midgard's flute!
And it can only be played by a 1st class goddess like you, Big Sister!
Now then, hurry! Play that flute!
Over my dead body!
Midgard!
The vaccine's more powerful than I thought...
You did it!
I'm not going to go down so easily...
I won't go down like this... I'm not going to let it end like this!
Looks like it worked!
Yes.
It's over now, isn't it?
Yes.
Urd, the nightmare is over now.
Now then, let's all go home together.
Right!
Well, I don't know about that...
Huh?
What's wrong? Banpei?
Skuld!
Midgard...
You're the program vaccine...
Your nightmare has only just begun!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a Wing!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a Wing!
I love you so much it hurts...
And it hurts me that I can't tell you how I feel.
You and I have matching hearts...
So we must share the same scars deep down inside.
But now that I'm in your arms, I think I can catch...
Nobody else matters... All we have to do is gaze at each other.
It's all right for your heart to flutter... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
Don't run away from happiness.
I'll always be waiting for you.
So come rest your wings anytime.
It's all right to cry... anytime you need to.
I just want to see you again... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
I just want you to be happy.
The program has started to spin out of control...
And soon, both the goddess and the human will be faced with...
Next episode: Ah! Always By My Side
Keiichi, I'm so glad I got the chance to meet you...
