Wait! Please just listen to me for now.
Not on your life!
Ku-chan!
No! Don't bully my big brother!
Wait, Ku-chan!
I must make her our companion at any cost.
That's why...
That's why I must do it.
What is this little girl?
No, it can't be...
You got your claws into such a little child?!
Claws?!
Filthy! Thou art a filthy man!
Water Celebration!

Feather 6: Maison Izumo Flower War
I didn't use even one-hundredth of my power for the last attack.
What does such a weak monkey want to say to me?
I want you to be my... my Sekirei.
W-What?
Didst thou just tell me to be thy Sekirei?
That's right! L... we need your power.
How couldst thou be so shameless in public?!
Shameless?
I thought to spare thy life but...
I shall obliterate thee after all!
That's bad! She's dead serious!
Big brother!
I was so angry, I missed my aim.
I'll eliminate thee next time!
Even so, I can't move until you listen to me!
Why? Why does my chest feel like this?
Wait! Your opponents are us, right?!
Haven't learned your lesson yet?
A Sekirei not yet emerged doesn't know anything!
Seo!
This man! Is he an Ashikabi, too?!
Geez, guess I've got no choice.
Hey! Close your eyes, kid!
This is a little too stimulating for ya.
Enough! Just do it!
Wh-What art thou going to do?
Don't look!
Don't look! Don't look, Ku-chan!
Don't look, Ku-chan!
Wh-Wh-What are ye doing?!
This is how...
Thunderstorm of our pact, destroy our Ashikabi's misfortune!
This is an incantation only emerged Sekireis can use...
That is...
The special words to chant when we use major power...
Every Sekirei has his or her own incantation.
The incantation...
God's Song - God's Song! - God's Song!
- God's Song! - God's Song!
Watch out!
High energy reaction!
Musubi-tan High energy reaction!
Musubi-tan They are in big trouble!
Musubi-tan Hello? Musubi-tan?
Hello? Musubi-tan?
Thunder?
Incoming > > > > > Matsu
Incoming > > > > > Matsu Matsu-san!
Matsu-san!
Go to the place on the map I'll send you.
Mina-tan might be in danger!
He's in our way!
Thou!
We can't have him as collateral damage, you know?
A-Are you okay?
This man protected me with his own body...
We won't miss next time.
Is that the best thou canst do?
It escaped.
Hey, stop there!
Seo-san, please calm down!
Don't come any closer!
How will you pay me back, huh?
Why?! My strength is...
You stomped over my girls too, didn't you?
I can't work up an ounce of strength... Why?
My ability as Ashikabi is endorsed by Takehito.
It's a bit special.
Now, how will you pay for this?
Well, how about I force you to emerge and make you into my dedicated slave?
No, this is not the man.
I don't want it. The one... the one I want is...
S-Seo-san!
Could you please... let her go?
She is... she is my Sekirei!
Seo!
Are you cheating on us in front of our eyes?
Quite the nerve!
T-Time out!
You told us we were the only Sekireis for you, didn't you?
I haven't done anything, yet! Listen to me first!
Thou...
Thou must take the responsibility.
R-Responsibility?
Don't play dumb! Thou hast said I was thy Sekirei, correct?!
Y-Yes, I did, Ma'am!
Not only wert thou not afraid of me, but thou also protected me with thy own flesh.
Furthermore, thou savedest me from the wicked Ashikabi.
Wicked?
For a monkey, thou art a man of mettle.
Strange...
My heart, which once clamored so loudly in protest, is surprisingly calm now.
What is thy name?
Minato.
I'm Minato Sahashi.
Minato...
I-I don't know anything about you, but...
The reason I met you in my dream must be...
because we could definitely grow to understand each other!
So!
Thou art a magical man...
Very well! I, the Sekirei Tsukiumi, accept thy marriage proposal with good grace!
M-Marriage proposal?
Thou hast said I'm thy Sekirei!
I did, I did! I'm sorry!
Minato!
Yes?
From now on, the only one allowed to kill thee is me, Tsukiumi.
Wh-What is this? The feeling welling up from my heart...
Something warm and strong...
So this is... emergence...
Tsu-Tsukiumi-san!
Tsukiumi is fine. Thou hast become my Ashikabi...
with this as a wedding ceremony.
Many... years to come...
We... just wasted a fight?
Seems like it.
Ku-chan!
As I thought... that little child is thy Sekirei...
Well, she's a mere child so I can tolerate it, but...
- the real wife is me... - Minato-san!
Are you all right?
Musubi-chan!
Oh, good! You weren't in danger.
Yes. See, she's Tsukiumi-san. She's joined our group.
Minato... thou... thou... How many Sekireis dost thee have?
Um... you are...
Calling Minato-tan Um... you are...
Calling Minato-tan Mina-tan! Mina-tan!
Mina-tan! Mina-tan!
What happened?! I can't identify the situation. All I can see are trees!
Wa...
Wa?
Water Celebration!
Everyone's so late...
It'll be dinner time soon.
When you're like that, you look like their mother, Miya.
Did you say... mother?
No! Big sister! You look like a big sister!
I guess you're right.
From their point of view, I am really kind of their big sister...
We're back!
Ah, they're back.
Oh dear!
We've just come back.
Landlady, we've just come back!
Minato, who is this woman?
She's Miya Asama. She's the landlady here...
Sahashi-san... who is she?
Ah, eh, um...
I'm his wife!
W-Wife?!
What art thou so surprised at?
We have gotten married, so I've become thy wife.
Wife...
Wh-What was that? Such tangled-up feelings in my heart...
What's with this little brat?! Get away from him!
Musubi-chan, what's wrong?
I am...
His wife, too!
Out of my way! The real wife is me!
This is a soap opera. Soap opera world!
Don't you need to join them?
Even though I'm not participating in the soap opera there, I attack...
no, attract Mina-tan in my own way.
What a lame joke...
To think he made Tsukiumi, who hated Ashikabi so much, emerge...
Minato Sahashi... he's a mysterious man.
Now we shall fight!
That's what I want!
Enough!
I won't allow any violence here in Maison Izumo.
She is... good!
I'm sorry, Landlady.
How about you?
They say when in Rome, do as the Romans do. I shall obey the landlady here...
Landlady... ah, this is...
The Sekirei Plan.
H-How did you?
I already told you. My husband worked in the MBI's research section.
Then, when Ku-chan came...
Yes, I could guess the situation...
You are his Sekirei, right?
I'm his wife, Tsukiumi. Pleased to meet thee, Landlady.
I'm his wife, too!
Thou... couldst thou be?
Hmm, who art thee, again?
I feel as if I'm well acquainted with one looking like thee, but...
Maybe it's just a chance resemblance.
I'm Kagari. I look forward to getting to know you.
I just took off my mask.
Should I feel relieved or pathetic?
Kagari-tan.
What?
How are the burns from the other day? You should stabilize your ability soon.
Are you telling me I should get emerged?
Yes. Even without the burns, your body is still...
What a thing to say to a defective being like me.
I won't be chosen by anybody, nor will I choose anybody.
I only have one wish...
To kill that man with my own hands.
Kagari-tan!
I'm going out to work, so please tell Miya I don't need dinner.
Kagari-tan...
I-I wanna take a peek... No!
In the end I let him stay last night, but I can't believe I'm alone with a boy...
I'm sure... I'm your Sekirei.
Please give me your... seal.
Hold it! What do you mean, seal?!
The symbol to prove that I am yours.
Wait a sec! I can't understand what you're talking about at all!
So, what's a Sekirei?
The Sekirei Plan...
That's the name of the game unfolding here in the capital.
Game?
And we Sekireis were released
in order to meet our individual Ashikabi-sama, our masters.
Normally I could never believe something like that,
but he doesn't look like he was lying...
I'm number 107, Shiina, and probably your Sekirei.
Probably?
I said probably because I haven't confirmed my body's reaction.
And to confirm, I must have mucosal contact, so...
Mucosal... like a kiss?
If you wish, I can do more!
More...
Thank you for the bath.
Is anything wrong?
No, nothing.
I could never tell Mom or Bro about this...
Hey, how about going out shopping tomorrow?
There aren't any boys' clothes here, and you need to change, don't you?
But what if someone chases me like yesterday?
No problem. I thought of a plan.
What?! Didst thou say she's also Minato's Sekirei?!
Yes... I'm sorry.
That's how it is. Nice to meet you, Tsukiumi-tan.
Stop that tan thing!
Whoa! You've got another one, again!
I'm sorry.
Minato! Don't tell me she is also...
No, no! She's definitely not!
My Ashikabi's not here.
That's good. I'm Tsukiumi. Pleased to meet thee.
I'm Uzume. You've got a lot of competition. Good luck!
Uzume-san! Stop adding more fuel to the flame!
Because... I am Minato's real wife.
I am his real wife, too!
Dost thou understand what real wife means?
No, I don't.
Here, Minato-san. Open your mouth wide.
Minato, I'm sure thou understandest
that if thou shouldst eat that, thy life would be forfeit.
Ah... thank you, but I can eat by myself...
Here!
You're only a child!
This place has become quite lively.
Yes, it'll be more fun.
That Minato... I told him I would wash his back, but...
He refrained.
Sharing bath and berth are the privileges of Ashikabis.
What is sharing a berth?
It's when a man and a woman sleep cocooned together.
Cocooned?
Ugh, I feel a chill. I did get doused with water a lot today...
Big brother...
Who do you like?
Y-You can't just ask me out of the blue like that...
Well... I like all of you.
Thou dost not need to know.
- Musubi-chan, Tsukiumi... - Eh? I'm his wife, too!
Matsu-san,
And Ku-chan, too.
All of you chose someone like me who doesn't have any special abilities or qualifications.
So I want to repay you for caring for me.
Something I can do...
Well, I don't even know what I can do yet, though.
Was that too complicated for you, Ku-chan?
Ku-chan!
I like you very much, big brother.
Stay with me forever.
And then, when I get bigger,
please make me your wife.
What was that?! I just felt like someone got the better of me.
Me, too!
Really, it'd be best if we could stay like this, with no fights at all...
Number 09. I confirmed her emergence.
It's time.
The time has come.
The economy, technologies, networks...
there's nothing to fear any longer.
For the sake of the lovely birds who flew to land, I shall willingly play the fool!
It's a festival!
The stage Shintou Teito!
The Sekirei Plan moves to phase two!
Yo, baby girls! Get ready now!
This is renai no shinansho
Don't let it go, aserazu so
Without furaingu de show time
Get the funky beat!

Dear Sweet Heart!
Kagari, good morning.
Uzume! You're walking around looking like that again...
What's the matter? I'm wearing my panties...
Gah! I forgot them!
You really are so...
Oops, I did it again!
Wait, Kagari, don't you think your reaction is kind of lacking?
Feather 7: The Black Sekirei Please favor us again next time!
