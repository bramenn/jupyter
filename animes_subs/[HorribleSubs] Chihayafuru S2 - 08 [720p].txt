The High School National Ogura Hundred Poets Karuta Championship begins.
We'll win every match
and become number one in Japan!
Chihaya Furu
Verse 8
Which shines over Mount Mikasa
Wh-Why am I dressed like this?
You're asking why?
Did you forget what happened last year?
Right, right
When you suddenly collapsed last year,
it was because you were overwhelmed by the heat and your nerves.
So this year, we'll make sure the heat isn't an issue.
It's okay.
I'm not wearing a hakama this year.
But...
Plus, this is my second time at Omi Jingu.
We're back.
This is our second national championship.
What kinds of matches will we play?
How strong are the other teams?
Hey, Tsukuba!
Stop sneaking pictures of girls!
They'll arrest you!
Don't insult me!
I'm taking pictures of the pretty Akita ladies
while taking pictures of the karuta holy land, the Omi Learning Center!
Y-You're not supposed to admit it...
Ooh, I've seen this area in pictures before!
The Master match takes place up here every year!
Where do they put the TV cameras?!
Cut it out already!
This is the first national championship for our first-years.
Okay, let's all get changed...
Into the new T-shirts my sister made!
Winners
Winners
Wow!
It's got punch!
So cool!
That's a lovely blue.
Huh? Wait...
I can see something in the dots...
Second Place
Second place...
Second place winners?!
Huh?
What did you expect?
The champions will be Retro-kun's Hokuo.
Sorry, everyone.
Let's wear our regular T-shirts.
All ready.
Sorry. We ended up having to wear our usual T-shirts.
That's okay. We can focus better when we're in familiar gear.
Hey, Hanano! Take a picture!
Geez, what now?
My brothers are waiting at home!
I'm a starter for the national championship, of course!
Your bro's gonna knock them out!
You're lying again!
Why would you be a starting member?
We're heading down!
Oh, okay.
I want to be a starter!
I've given up Second Verse Karuta
to focus on mainstream karuta since spring!
I've learned a lot at the Shiranami society!
This time, I'll successfully change the order, show my true skill, and become a regular!
Tsukuba!
The lineups for the first round are up.
What? They already chose the starting members?
Huh?
1 Nishida Yusei 2 Oe Kana 3 Ayase Chihaya 4 Mashima Taichi 5 Tsukuba Akihiro
What?! Tsukuba's really a starter!
That's amazing!
Starter...
The group stage match-ups were drawn yesterday,
so Komano and I already came up with the order for the first round.
Why me? Isn't Komano-senpai a starter?
For the National Tournament
A month has passed since the Tokyo regional.
You've worked very hard.
In terms of skill, you're even with me.
Don't forget that our goal is to become number one in Japan!
While the two rounds in the group stage are taking place,
I'll be scouting the other top schools
to prepare for the championship bracket!
The five of you have to get us there!
Does that mean you're not playing in the group stage?!
Are you really okay with that?!
Yeah.
I'll need Hanano to help me scout.
What?
Check groups H and I for us.
Geez...
Fine.
I'm impressed.
You brought your own notepad.
I-It's no big deal...
Then I'll show you which room you'll be in.
O-Okay.
He's so cool...
Desktomu-kun worked just as hard as the rest of us.
Could I do what he did?
After putting in so much hard work,
could I accept that someone who started later
had caught up to me?
If Ayase's serious about her dream for us to become number one in Japan,
we can't flounder around like usual.
There has to be someone in a support role.
Yo, Eyebrows!
Should you really be so worked up?
Isn't tomorrow's individual tournament
and your chance to make Class A more important?
It doesn't matter if I lose my first match tomorrow.
We'll win every match today.
I want to win...
together.
Our opponent's order isn't up yet.
I believe we were matched up with a school from Chiba.
It's a strange feeling.
Have I been infected by Chihaya's greed?
I want us to become number one in Japan together.
There it is!
Is this...
Don't tell me that...
No way...
Huh?
Chiba International School of Information Sciences Napa Payakaroon Rachel Port Anthony Sorb Park Kyung Seo Matt Rowan
Um...
In group C, I need to pay attention to...
the First Akashi Girls' School from Hyogo.
Make sure you pay extra close attention to the third-year Ousaka Megumu!
Is she really that special?
She was the west representative in last year's Queen match.
She lost a close match to Yumin,
Yumin?
but she's still the strongest girl in west Japan.
Okay...
But how can I tell who's who?
For now, I'll put that they're all ordinary-looking.
Oh, excuse me.
Sorry!
I got the quick energy boost you wanted.
Thanks, Megumu.
Megumu?
I'm so thirsty.
Here.
Energy boost...
Did something run out of power?
Y-Yeah... Thanks...
Ousaka Megumu is ordinary-looking and an airhead.
Megumu-tan! You're adorable as always!
Megumu-tan?!
I've got the best seat in the house!
Hey, is that a new model?!
This guarantees that I'll capture Megu-tan's beautiful karuta!
She's ordinary-looking, an airhead, and popular?!
I'm a little shocked...
Moreover, she's popular with old-school freaks!
The three cameramen with glasses are back again.
We only recently got them to silence the shutter sound during matches.
They're a pain.
I know. I wish we could dump them in an incinerator.
Swoon!
She's ordinary-looking, an airhead, popular, and sharp-tongued?!
Swoon! Swoon!
Okay, let's do the best we can.
Yes!
I'm so confused,
but there's a lot more to female karuta players than meets the eye.
Groups E and F are in the hall by the main office.
The team that we must watch carefully...
The team we must watch...
is last year's champion, Fujisaki High School.
They've won the championship 13 times.
With over 50 members and a long tradition,
they're the greatest obstacle in our path.
I have to collect as much data as I can.
The first match for group B is about to start.
Will they be okay?
Mizusawa High
Chiba International High School of Information Sciences
Their first opponent,
Chiba International High School of Information Sciences, is new to karuta,
so I couldn't find any data.
Karuta's never been big in Chiba,
so it should be easy for them to win.
Wh-What should I do?!
I've never been so close to a foreigner before!
What should I do?
Are we really playing against these guys?!
Can they play karuta?!
Can they understand Japanese?!
The foreigners are wearing hakama,
while we're wearing T-shirts...
I'm so ashamed!
What do I do?
Everyone's thrown off...
But...
The biggest question is why you're crying!
It's impressive that there are so many people playing karuta.
No one wears hakama except us,
but it's lucky to be notable.
Without hakama, we are the most noticeable.
That's right!
Let's make a bet the most card!
Karuta has become a global game like poker and Othello!
Ignoring Chihaya for now, I need to calm the others down.
Forgive me,
but your pronunciation is not correct...
Maybe you can more easily speak Japanese than English, can't you?
I'm so embarrassed now!
They caught us!
Who said that we could put pressure on them by acting like foreigners?!
I barely know middle school English!
It's not my fault!
I've never left Japan before!
Was it you?!
Just so we're clear, my English is better than yours!
Listen to yourself!
You've never left Chiba before!
I study hard!
I study hard, too!
But your intonation is totally wrong!
Quiet down!
Please place your cards!
We grew up in Japan
and fell in love with karuta.
Please...
Let's have a good match.
Two more minutes of memorization time!
The media is here?
Yes, it's from a local station in Chiba.
Ah, The Chiba International High School of Information Sciences.
They're attracting a lot of attention,
since we have foreign high school students wearing hakama.
Hopefully, it'll be good publicity for the tournament.
Man, why is their first match against a Tokyo school?
Those guys are probably strong.
The hosts should have put more thought into the brackets.
I wanted to do a feature like, The blond samurai
forges ahead with karuta!
Finish them
It's really bugging me...
It's really bugging me that she's wearing her kimono backwards...
His card placement
is exactly like what I used when I first started!
The cards are lined up in alphabetical order by unique syllable!
My opponent's even better!
They're lined up in alphabetical order by second verse!
It's so unusual, it's actually hard to memorize!
Time's up!
Thank you for the game.
Thank you for the game.
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Like the sound...
Yes! I got it!
He's big... I-I'm scared...
There weren't any black people in Hokkaido...
He's lying
I can't beat him...
Is he from Vietnam? Thailand? Laos?
In any case,
his card placement is very methodical.
Hundred Poets Competitive Karuta
Guys, just do what we always do.
They're just a bunch of karuta lovers.
That's impossible!
Karuta's difficult and complicated!
How could foreigners ever love karuta?!
I mean, Japanese people don't like it, either...
We grew up in Japan
and fell in love with karuta.
Fell in love...
the thistle and brush are blown by the autumn wind
Though I prayed...
She's fast... Really fast.
So fast that it's scary...
This is competitive karuta.
At first, I was willing to try anything.
Tea ceremony, Asian calligraphy, flower arrangement...
Since my physical appearance was that of a foreigner,
I thought I might be able to make
friends if I did something really Japanese.
I first encountered karuta in high school.
You memorize a hundred cards and try to take them from each other?
That sounds so intellectual! So fun!
But as I became more engrossed in competitive karuta...
Eh, not interested.
No, thanks.
He's just a foreigner.
My Japanese friends grew distant.
It's okay...
I know that everyone thinks we're strange,
but it's okay!
I never asked to be treated colder than the winds of Mount Hatsuse
Swift waters parted by the jagged rocks
Yes! I got the card!
This is my favorite poem!
I'm also a fan of this poem.
No way!
I also like this one, this one, and this one!
Feel love deepen, The storm will soon, The hazed field of ...
They're all love poems.
You're not taking them from me!
are joined at river's end
My own sleeves are like...
None are left...
All alone, I step...
He's got good sense.
So there are people with good karuta sense who aren't Japanese.
But then there are cards where he doesn't move an inch.
He's a simple player who only takes the cards he recognizes.
His hearing is superb.
If he learned more about how to send and place cards...
They're free.
They're showing us how our playing style is dictated by competitive karuta.
They don't adhere to certain theories when placing cards.
They pay extra attention to the poems they like.
They use whatever form they want.
They're all playing Hundred Poets in their own way.
One card...
One card at a time, Mizusawa!
Yeah!
Don't get too excited.
Let the Chiba kids have their glory.
After many, many years...
A house left to the weeds...
Amazing...
36!
One moment please!
This is beautiful...
17 is over here!
They're moving so fast,
yet they're moving in unison...
This is our love for karuta.
This is the product
of the hard work we put in
every day!
The best karuta is beautiful to watch.
Unfortunately for the Chiba International School of Information Sciences,
this tournament ended with the first match...
Any comments?
U-Uh, any comments?
I suppose...
We were put in our place.
Er, that's what you want to say?
What are you doing?
Wait, don't erase that!
Sorry, we'll fix it once we're done!
Stop!
Karuta is fun,
but competitive karuta is amazing.
We were shown how a good team can play competitive karuta.
We'll do our best to promote karuta at our school, improve ourselves,
and return a better team next year.
Bye, Arata.
Let me know when you're done watching your friends play.
Thanks, Uncle Motoki!
I'm a little late.
Is their first match over?
Are you going to come tomorrow, Arata?
What? Just the individual tournament in two days?!
I was lying.
After I pay my respects, I'll go watch Chihaya and Taichi.
