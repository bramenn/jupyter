SCRIPT
Yesterday,
after I got back from Mr. Braun's,
nothing happened...
Moeka and her group
always appeared on Friday the 13th.
Did the world line change when I sent the message
Do not give in to your assistant's threats. Follow Suzuha!
telling myself not to follow Suzuha?
If so, then...
Has Mayuri been saved?
Will nothing happen now?
Huh?
My watch isn't working...
That's strange.
I just wound it.
OP
suujuuoku mono kodou no kazu sae
Even the world's billions of heartbeats
anata ni wa matataki teido no saji na toukyuu
Are nothing to you but a fleeting and insignificant question
kako ni torawarete mirai wo nageku mo
We may be trapped in the past or lament the future
chiri hitotsu gosan wo yurusanu hitsuzen
But predetermination does not allow the slightest mistake
mugen ni hirogaru yume mo egaku mirai mo
The infinite dreams and imagined futures before us
bokutachi ni yurusareta kyoei no genri
Are naught but vain theories we may hold
yuugen sore wa futatsu no hari ga shimesu
Finitude is what the two clock hands show
zankoku na yakujou to sentaku e
As they point toward a cruel destiny and choice
Hacking to the Gate
dakara ima ichibyou goto ni sekaisen wo koete
And now I cross the boundary between worlds each second
kimi no sono egao mamoritai no sa
Because I want to protect that smile of yours
soshite mata kanashimi no nai jikan no ruupu e to
And a loop in time without sadness will once again
nomikomarete yuku kodoku no kansokusha
Engulf me, a lonely observer
What's wrong?
What did you want to talk about?
Help me.
Mayuri will die in two hours?
You've time leaped and seen it over and over...
That must have been painful.
Given what Amane-san said,
we need to go from the alpha Attractor Field where we are now
to the beta world line, in order to save Mayuri.
To do that,
we need the IBN 5100, to delete SERN's data on you guys.
But the IBN 5100 that used to be at Yanabayashi Shrine
disappeared when the world line moved.

Kiryuu-san's,
Urushibara-san's,
Feyris-san's,
Do not give in to your assistant's threats. Follow Suzuha!
and the one about tailing Amane-san.
When you undid the one about following Amane-san,
the attack was delayed a day.
Meaning that
if you go back and undo the other D-mails,
you could return to the world line that had the IBN 5100, right?
It's just a theory.
There's no scientific proof.

But even still...
I realize that I suggested it,
but canceling out all those D-mails...
Yeah, it'll be pretty tough.
But I have no choice.
Take care.
Y-Your brain's a valuable sample, okay?
You're able to keep memories across world line changes.
And you've survived the time leap...
We should map it.
Thank you, Kurisu.
I won't remember that you called me Kurisu... right?
What?
Nothing.
Going in order, the next one you should undo is...
Feyris's D-mail.
Hello?
Daru...
Do you know where Feyris is?
Sure!
Where? Where is she?
The UPX Arena.
The final round of the Rai-Net ABGC just ended.
ABGC?
Short for the Rai-Net Access Battlers Grand Championship. Duh...
It's a tournament of Rai-Netters, from across Japan.
It just ended with her victory.
I'm so excited!
After Feyris sent her D-mail,
Akiba returned to only selling electronics.
I don't know what was in the message...
Who did she send it to?
What did she send?
Kyouma!
Feyris?
What's wrong?
The cat-girl is with some guy in a lab coat.
Don't let her escape.
Not that she could...
No one can escape my Darkness Force.
Who's chasing you?
The Viral Attackers.
The Viral Attackers?
They're the worst kind of Rai-Netter.
They'll do anything to win.
They were mad about losing to Feyris,
so they set an ambush.
An ambush?
This way!
Where'd she go?
She's gotta be nearby.
Yeah.
By the way, didn't you just call me?
That's right...
I wanted you to tell me about your D-mail.
D-mail?
The message you sent to the past.
A message I sent to the past?
What are you talking about?
In this world line,
Feyris doesn't remember sending a D-mail.
Well, you see...
There they are!
Hypothetically speaking... Hypothetically,
if I said we built a time machine, would you believe me?
I'd believe anything you say!
Really?
Feyris just built a dimensional-transport machine.
Let's imagine that Akiba was a city filled with moe.
Say you used the time machine to change it to the electronics market it is now.
How would you do it?
What kind of game is this?
Whatever! Please just answer!
I don't really know...
But I bet a moe-filled city would be fun!
Actually, I talked to Dad about that once.
About opening a maid cafe in Akiba.
But he said I couldn't.
You mean May Queen?
How did you know that name?
I never even told my dad.
It used to exist!
Here, in Akiba!
Akiba had moe everywhere!
Kyouma?
And more than anyone else, you loved that city!
But once you sent that message,
the whole city changed!
What did you send?
Please. Tell me!
There they are! Over here!
What's wrong?
Ramen
Here.
This is where May Queen was...
The cafe you wanted to run.
You worked here.
And Mayuri, too.
Daru came all the time.
We met here.
I'll get it right away!
We now begin the Feyris Cup day division.
Plan Code: G-B-A-C-K
Here's my The World's In Danger!
A lot of masters came in today. It was fun!
Feyris?
I-I'm fine.
What happens if you can't undo the D-mail?
Mayuri's life is...
You're lying.
You're lying!
What do you mean, her life is in danger?
You remember the message?
Please tell me!
I have to undo it!
I can't.
Why not?
Mayuri... You don't care if Mayuri dies?
Of course I do!
But...
Feyris!
I brought my dad back to life,
after his death, ten years ago.
I changed the past
to prevent his death.
Kyouma!
Kyouma...
Your pretty face is ruined, mister.
Now, princess, you're coming with me.
Let me go!
Kyouma!
We caught the cat-girl.
My super-dangerous aura's
You'll be seeing him soon.
been telling me it wants her turned black.
Until then, we'll...
Stop it.
Only one can stand at a scene's forefront,
the phoenix with black wings.
Let her go!
Kyouma!
You there, mister.
I'll make the cat-girl mine with an elegant, crazy dance.
Still want to play?
Stop it! Please!
Stop!
Oh, no! Run!
Daddy!
And that'll be the last thing she ever sees...
Wait!
What were you kids doing?
It's time!
C203 is here!
Huh? Who're you?
The police? I'm under arrest?
I'm glad you're safe...
I'm really glad.
Daddy...
Thank you.
I heard you won.
I came to celebrate,
but I didn't see you at the UPX arena.
You didn't answer your phone, so I went looking for you.
Okabe-kun, I don't know how to thank you.
There's nothing to thank me for...
If only I'd gone to see the tournament,
this wouldn't have happened.
Daddy...
You have work. It's okay.
Rumiho...
An IBN 5100?
Yes, I know you don't have it anymore,
but where is it now?
Could you get it back?
There were issues...
I feel bad for Hashida-san.
Hashida-san?
Hashida Suzu-san?
You know her?
She was the one who gave me the IBN 5100.
I'll be fine.
I'll find the IBN 5100. And I'll get it for you.
Suzuha...
She got it for us...
Daddy, you can tell him.
But...
He saved my life, and he really wants to know.
A long time ago, Rumiho was kidnapped.
The company wasn't as big as its current size,
and I couldn't collect the ransom.
And then, someone came and told me
that they'd purchase the IBN 5100 for a huge amount.
So that's how you lost it?
Because of it, I was able to raise the ransom money.
Ever since,
I've always kept my promises to my daughter.
No matter how small...
No matter what happens.
Daddy...
Rumiho
Papa
I brought my dad back to life,
after his death, ten years ago.
I changed the past to prevent his death.
If I send the D-mail, he'll...
Okarin, are you sending a D-mail?
If you do that, all of this will disappear!
But if I don't, Mayuri, you'll...
Can I come in?
Sure.
Feyris?
Um... Thanks for earlier.
I was really scared.
I've never felt that much darkness
from so many people.
Weren't they all wearing black?
I'm being serious.
I'm sorry.
Feyris...
What's wrong?
Call me Rumiho.
If it weren't for you, Kyouma... I mean, Okabe-san...
I don't know what would've happened.
Don't correct yourself.
Just call me what you always do.
Anyway, Kyouma, thank you so much.
You're my prince.
Your prince?
I'm no prince.
I'm a mad...
Mayushii...
Is it true that Mayushii's life is in danger?
Yes.
Ten years ago, on my eighth birthday,
my dad had promised to take me somewhere.
But work came up, so he had to cancel.
I knew he couldn't help it, but I was so lonely.
I thought he didn't love me.
I told him I hated him! That I wanted him to die!
And then...
That was the last time I ever spoke to him.
Died in the crash...
Japanese passenger, Akiha Yukitaka...
I sent a D-mail to change that past.
We have your daughter. Take the Shinkansen.
We have your daughter. Take the Shinkansen.
Ransom is 100 million yen.
Ransom is 100 million yen.
We have your daughter. Ransom is 100 million yen. Take the Shinkansen.
We have your daughter. Ransom is 100 million yen. Take the Shinkansen.
So he wasn't in the crash,
and you never brought moe culture to Akiba.
And Akiba remained an electronics market.
I was happy.
These ten years...
Feyr... Rumiho...
I'll send that D-mail.
My dad died in an accident, ten years ago.
That's what truly happened.
These ten years have been a dream.
After all this time with him,
I know how much he loved me.
And Mayushii is my friend!
I can't be selfish.
You're sure?
No.
I'm not!
I remember
what happened before the world line changed.
But I remember what happened after, too!
It's all mixed together...
And I don't think I'll be able to tell
which is real, for much longer.
There may be another way...
I know! I can ask Kurisu
No! I don't want to cause you trouble.
You really are my prince.
It's time for me to wake up from this dream.
But let me have one thing...
Can I cry a little?
Yeah.
Feyris-san...
Yeah, she accepted.
Get ready.
Here I am!
What's wrong, Kyouma?
You look down!
The kidnapping was just a joke. I love you, Daddy. See you soon.
By the way...
If the world reverts to how it was,
will all my memories vanish?
Your memories are from before and after
the world line changed, right?
I'm sure you'll remember.
Good...
Feyris wouldn't want to forget her time with Kyouma.
Thank you.
It's ready, Okabe!
Goodbye, Daddy.
Kyouma!
Have you seen my cell phone?
Feyris...
Mayushii says she doesn't know.
So you're the only other person I can ask.
Kyouma, did you see what's on it?
If you did, forget it!
It must remain forever sealed!
Kyouma, why don't you say anything?
Like, What's the it?
Feyris...
Hey! Hey!
Get your hands off her!
You're doing something perverted again, right?
Okarin's so bold.
Kyouma and Feyris fought a great darkness,
as lovers together, in a past life!
We're really close!
You fight lots of people, don't you?
Is Feyris-san another one like Okabe?
I'm sorry.
The IBN 5100 wasn't at Yanabayashi Shrine.
Ten years ago, Feyris gave it to the shrine.
They said it was there until last year.
Where...
