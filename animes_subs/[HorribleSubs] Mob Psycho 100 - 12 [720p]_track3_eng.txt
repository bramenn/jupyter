All four of you are going to hell.
Nii-san's the only one that stands a chance anymore!
Kageyama-kun, use all of your powers!
I can't let them all die.
I have no choice but to fight with all I've got.
Don't do it, Mob.
When things go south, it's okay to run away!
Damn it! I can't believe this is happening.
R-Reigen-san just...
I have a bad feeling about this...
A tremendous amount of stress is going to hit Nii-san.
Something's going to happen!
Mob Psycho 100
Honestly...
Honestly, I don't want to hurt anyone.
But if I don't, we're going to be killed.
That's the feeling I got.
I realized that I have to do it in order to protect everyone.
That's the kind of situation we're in right now.
Nii-san...
And yet...
Run Away
Master told me
Don't Fight
that it was okay to run away.
So...
Leave it
to Master
I-Impossible...
Don't scare me like that!
I thought you actually cut me for a sec.
How are you standing, Reigen-san?
So that katana was a fake after all.
It totally felt plastic.
So what kind of trick did you use to cut the floor earlier?
Hey, what's going on?
He's acting like he usually does.
Then... I'll just chop off your head next!
Ow!
Listen...
Real adults don't have time
to play with toy swords!
That's Kageyama-kun's master for you, I guess.
Sakurai, move!
Candy-chan!
Whoa! An evil spirit?
Hey, Mob! Do something.
Huh? That was surprisingly light.
A plushie?
Huh?
What are you, some mascot?!
Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to rip your costume!
What?
Is Reigen-san actually the real deal?
Don't get cocky.
Crap! He's surrounded!
Huh? What is this?
Is this like the newest form of 3D imagery or something?
What were you even trying to do?
He nullified all of them?
Is this man some kind of monster?
How can this be?
Are you telling me someone this skilled still exists in this world?
He must be eliminated.
We can't have him getting in the way of our world domination.
Huh?
I see. You were using some kind of magic trick, too, huh?
You bunch of frauds.
Just try that thing with the black orbs again.
That many?
Is he going to be okay?
Leave this to the adult here.
My body seems to be in great shape today.
Master really is amazing.
It's okay to run away.
As soon as he heard those words,
the explosive amount of energy building up within Mob
changed its direction.
There are times when the power of one's words is unfathomable.
Those with power must fight.
That responsibility had made Mob's bridge collapse.
Sometimes, however...
One's heart can find a resolution just by being offered a helping hand.
As a result, all of Mob's energy was temporarily tossed over to Reigen.
In essence, he had successfully run away
and was feeling rather refreshed now.
All that was left in his heart
was gratitude toward his master.
Reigen

Reigen Arataka
Mob
Are these soap bubbles?
My Black Orbs swallow up and destroy anything they touch...
And this man is touching them with his bare hands...
Why? What happened to the man that was trying to run away just a moment ago?
Looks like I'll have to put my body on the line, too.
Five Hundred Kilogram Tackle!
One Ton Punch!
Two Ton Guillotine!
Hey, you still conscious?
No matter how powerful an esper you are,
I can't call you an excellent esper.
Because you have no desire for domination.
The reason you're so powerful and yet so unknown
is because you're living while hiding your powers, right?
But I am different!
I am filled with ambition, and I want to go higher and higher,
and hold this world in
Get off me. Stop talking while you're still on top of me.
What a dense energy barrier!
I see. The reason my Black Orbs burst earlier was because
the energy they were trying to take in was way over their limit!
Inconceivable...
Who are yo
Also, when you're speaking to someone,
take off your mask!
Hup!
Oh, it came off.
Actually, what's with this strength?
Could it be him...?
That's the only plausible explanation.
Seriously, someone your age needs to quit messing around.
Wh...
What could you possibly know?!
To hell with society!
Don't try and lecture me when you've only seen its good side!
As soon as I was born, I was abandoned by my parents.
I was all alone.
One happy family?
Mother's cooking?
I got to experience none of that as a boy.
I was terribly bullied at an orphanage, and I cursed the world!
Curse
If I hadn't, I wouldn't have survived!
And then I awakened to my powers...
I was able to survive because of these powers!
Anyone who rejects my way of living can
What? What's with that look?
Don't look at me like that!
I totally understand how you feel.
H-He's the same as me?
When I was in grade school, maybe it was around fourth grade...
I forgot to tell my parents that it was sports day at school that day,
so I was the only one with nothing to eat.
That's actually your fault... What are you even talking about?
A story about when I felt lonely as a boy.
Don't compare that stupid story to mine!
Jugan Air Gun!
It's the ultimate weapon of destruction.
Die!
If all else fails, I'll put you to sleep with this cursed cologne!
Hm? I don't really get it, but don't point that at others.
I'll take that.
Are you still doing that crap?
You use the psychic powers you've been blessed with for the stupidest things.
What?
You're like a little kid with a knife.
I can't bear to watch.
Who do you think you are?!
What's that thing on your forehead?
Th-That's...
It has nothing to do with you.
Then what's with these things that look like shoulder pads?
Those are to guard my shoulders...
Which means they're just accessories and have no purpose, right?
Huh?
Don't get the wrong idea.
No matter what kind of special powers they may be blessed with,
people are still only human.
Nothing more, and nothing less.
You guys haven't realized that yet!
You're so addicted to your special powers, you've developed tunnel vision.
You're plotting world domination when you haven't even seen the world?
Don't make me laugh!
No one's going to follow you like that!
First, get rid of those childish shoulder pads and grow up!
You, too!
You just want to escape from society, right?
If you want to make it big, you have to live in reality!
That's where you start.
You're telling us to return to being commoners?
What? No way! Don't look at this lightly!
You still don't get it, do you?!
Who the hell do you think you are?!
You're nothing more than a commoner!
You're just a part of the masses!
B-But Claw is a noble
I'm a commoner!
I'm much more powerful than you, and I'm still just a commoner...
So what does that make you?!
He dragged them out of their delusions and back into reality by force...
By shattering their dreams...
Your master's amazing!
Yeah.
No!
That is absolutely not true!
The division leader's face... He's that old?
I thought that maybe he was a girl, but...
I reject your claims!
People are only human. Nothing more, and nothing less.
That is what you said, isn't it?
Yeah.
That is incorrect.
That's far too cruel.
We are special!
We are superior lifeforms to the rest of humanity!
I'm sure you have to believe that to even go on.
But sadly, society has no interest in you.
Society this, society that!
No group made according to your stupid yardstick is big enough for me!
Quit relying on those around you, old man.
You're making me sad here.
I was born with these powers, so what's wrong with me showing them off?
What's wrong with changing the world?!
You stupid ape!
To me, you're all no different from monkeys!
It's hard to live!
Even though I'm so special!
I'm so amazing, so why won't you just acknowledge that?
The world should put me on a pedestal and worship me!
That is the only world that is worthy!
No, having psychic powers doesn't make you popular at all.
And that's all there is to it.
You'll never be popular. Give it up.
I'm going to erase you all...
Erase this whole building and start over!
Crap. Looks like I'm out of gas.
Mob. Lend me your powers again.
Actually, I'm also...
Crap! We're being sucked in!
Disappear! Disappear! Disappear!
You just don't know when to give up.
That's
Damn it!
You can also...
Disappear!
A mass of gravity, huh? Interesting.
Imagine the gravity going backward...
It's not an actual black hole.
If it's made from psychic powers,
I can always find a way to deal with it.
Old man...
You're no longer needed.
And as for you...
I'm disappointed in you.
You coward.
The Seventh Division will be dissolved.
I was to inspect the place and take anyone who seemed useful back to HQ...
What are you talking about? Weren't you a trainee?
Sadly, there wasn't anyone worth my time.
At least on the inside.
Well, see ya.
The evil spirits have been whittled down to one...
The poison jar has been completed!
Matsuo, there's nothing left for us to do.
Come out, my ultimate evil spirit, Marshmallow-chan!
The hell's that?
Dimple!
I was finally able to get out.
All right! Now that I've regained some of my strength,
I can help out a hundredfold!
It's already done.
Huh?
You mean the climax happened without me?
Is this an evil spirit?
Whoa!
Why are you able to see me when I'm not in my visible mode?
They're strong.
No, we were weak.
I've come to a realization.
Those guys just might be able to stop it...
Stop Claw from world domination...
Mob Psycho 100
Really? Let me see.
Here, look.
Oh, that's great!
Let's go together!
Ah, Tsubomi-chan...
She's as cute as ever today.
Our eyes met!
You're staring way too much.
Mezato-san!
You're panicking too much.
Staring at girls is all well and good,
but today's the day that you're going to talk to me, Mob-kun.
No, I've got club again today.
I'll wait until you're done.
But I've got my job after that.
Jeez. When are you going to tell me everything?
Your older brother came by last night.
Huh? My brother?
You must've been through a lot, too.
We both went a little crazy.
I'm about to go apologize to Onigawara-kun and the others.
I'll go with you.
But are you sure?
The entire student body's going to hate you.
That's my own fault for doing something so stupid.
And... now my brother is on my side,
so I'll keep in line.
Wha?
So it was you guys who planted the recorders on me.
That was a crappy thing to do.
And I knew anyway, so it's not like it matters now.
Huh?
What do you mean?
People didn't care whether I was actually the culprit or not.
They were chomping at the bit for a stick to beat me with, a chance to kick me out.
That's where the problem was.
I realized that I was hated by everyone around me,
and how weak my heart was.
Hey.
Your brother was worried about you.
He thought I was going to kick your ass since I was so pissed off,
but I'll let things slide since you are the shadow leader's younger brother.
What's wrong, Onigawara? You out of energy?
The hell do you think you're talking to?!
I'm still going to grow, just like White T Poison.
Body Transformation!
Fight on! Fight on! Fight on!
That's your older brother.
Is he okay? He looks like he's about to pass out.
Yes. Despite how he looks,
to me, Nii-san is stronger than anyone else.
But he's passed out on the ground.
By the way, President, did you give up on finding telepaths?
Huh? Actually, I haven't even started yet.
Right now, it's like a wild-goose chase, so I'm trying to get some actual leads.
You guys should at least try to help me out.
I tried searching on the Internet but couldn't find any.
Of course you're not going to find them that easily!
Hey.
Musashi-san!
What the heck, Mob-kun? You passed out again?
Inukawa, get some water!
Oh, sure.
What's up, old man?
Why'd you bring us here again?
I guess you haven't given up on psychic powers.
Actually, I wasn't the one who brought you here today.
It was at the behest of someone else.
Hello, nice to meet you.
So you guys must be the research subjects here.
Oh, it's another hot guy.
I see. Your powers are still weak,
but it'll definitely be worth nurturing them.
He's Hanazawa-kun, one of the guys who fought that organization that day.
What do you think? Do you guys want to get stronger with me?
Huh?
Since one of their divisions was crushed,
I'm sure Claw will make a move soon.
It'll be for self-defense and so you can fight back when that happens.
Leave the support to me.
Kageyama took all the glory that night.
Yeah.
Let's do this!
Yeah!
So, what brings you here?
I'm only here because Shigeo asked me to come.
He passed out from anemia and can't help with exorcising spirits.
Actually, do you even need Shigeo anymore?
You awakened to psychic powers, didn't you?
Don't be stupid. Those were all Mob's powers.
The only thing I gained from it is the ability to see you now.
Otherwise, nothing's changed.
So you're just a plain ol' con artist again.
You're a rather rude spirit.
All right. Then you help me out.
Dimple, was it?
Huh? Why do I have to help you?
That's why he had you come over, isn't it?
If he was just calling out, a phone call would have sufficed.
S-Seriously? Who do you guys think I am?
Spirits and Such Consultation Office
What? Aren't you Mob's errand boy?
I'm a high-level evil spirit!
I'm disappointed in you.
You coward.
Did I do something lame?
Did I make some kind of mistake?
Ugh, again? I told you to fix that habit of yours.
Shigeo's just at that age.
Let him bend all the spoons he wants.
You always say that.
Here, Nii-san. Let me see it.
What's with these kids?
Here, Nii-san.
Thanks, Ritsu.
Well, whatever.
Oh, there it is.
Hello? Oh, I'd dropped my phone.
Huh? The Seventh Division?
They were crushed.
Espers from outside infiltrated the place and slaughtered the upper echelon.
The division leader, Ishiguro-san, was no big deal either.
As for all of the underlings,
the enemy totally won them over.
Sho, what are you talking about?
I'm asking you for a status report on the inspection.
The organization you're so proud of isn't the best in the world at all.
Quit messing around and come back to Japan already, you stupid father.
Making me do an annoying inspection like that...
At least I got that off my chest.
Yes... Very soon.
Spirits and Such Consultation Office
And now the news.
We've received numerous reports of tsuchinoko sightings throughout Seasoning City.
Multiple Tsuchinoko Sightings Continue
City Hall, in a bid to reinvigorate the area, has put a bounty on the tsuchinoko
and is requesting help in capturing it.
Hello? Are you free right now?
Meet me in 90 minutes,
and wear clothes you can exercise in and don't mind getting dirty.
Mob and Reigen A Giant Tsuchinoko Appears
We're going to capture a tsuchinoko.
Huh?
Doesn't that excite you?
Isn't this private property?
This is the kind of place where those suckers show up.
Have you ever seen a tsuchinoko, Master?
Nope. It's just a hunch.
That's pretty random.
Don't you have any passion when it comes to UMAs?
Bigfoot, Nessie, and tsuchinoko!
I hear there's a bounty on its head.
Well, there's that, too.
Master, um...
What?
I don't think amateurs are supposed to go this deep into the mountains.
Mob, we might be amateurs when it comes to hiking,
but you have psychic powers.
Add to that my ingenuity...
Oh! Over there!
Look over there, Mob! I knew this place was the jackpot!
Huh? Was there actually a tsuchinoko?
Look! Matsutake! It's huge!
Oh... After all that talk about passion,
he's already distracted by the matsutake.
What the hell is that?!
Whatever it is, apparently it's starving!
We're going to exorcise it, Mob!
Actually, Master, isn't that the UMA?
You idiot! Those things don't exist!
Kill it!
Okay...
That's amazing.
It shrank so much after you exorcised it.
Er, actually, it just threw up a lot.
What the hell was that thing to begin with?
You already picked that many?
Well, whatever. Let's go home.
Huh? What about the tsuchinoko?
What are you talking about? Those things don't exist.
I'm gonna grill up some matsutake at the office.
You'll have some, right?
Yes.
Guess we should buy some kabosu, too.
Yes.
