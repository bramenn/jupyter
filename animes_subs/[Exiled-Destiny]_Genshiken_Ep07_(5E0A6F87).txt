Genshiken
I woke up and as usual forgot my cell and missed the Express.
My life reflected in the train window.
I'm sure I have something that I won't lose to anyone in Japan...
I can't run fast, though.
I'm not that strongly-built.
Here I go, at my dauntless pace.
Pass away, today's sadness, raining in the sun!
Hesitation, repetition, dreaming all night, all night.
Farewell sadness, to outer space you go!
Look to the sky and shout at the top of your lungs!
At this tempo!
Right now, at this tempo!
Genshiken Right now, at this tempo!
Suioh University
The weather's sure nice now.
That it is.
Hey, is this a good way to get to building 7?
I think it probably is...
New freshmen are here already.
That they are.
I wonder if Genshiken will get new members.
I hope not.
If Genshiken gets more active, it'll be harder for Kohsaka to quit.
Hi hi!
Sup.
Oh, Saki! Saki!
Huh?
Why don't we cosplay together for the freshman activities fair?
Absolutely not!
When on earth are you going to cosplay?
H-Hold on, you think it's a matter of time?
It isn't?
No, it's not, at all!
Now, now.
We've talked about basing our recruitment on cosplay...
That is, it's just two of us...
We're pretty much the world of hobbies.
Our members c-can do just about anything they want...
So yeah, that's the general feeling.
But I want to do it every chance I get!
Uh, yeah...
Your personality sure changes when it comes to cosplay...
It does?
Don't look at me if any weirdos show up.
I'd say it's a little late to worry about that now.
Because there's already plenty of them here?
So, aren't you going to start the number umpteen-hundred meeting thing?
Why wait?
Huh, so that's your disposition.
The original story goes into a second part...
And they get through okay.
A-At this point it's n-nostalgic to see Alex.
Good stuff.
How can you watch this over and over so much?
Huh?
Is it interesting?
Uh, you can't really simplify it that much...
We watch it because it's interesting to see whether it's interesting or not...
You're no fun, girl.
Miss President...
Our chairman!
Did he graduate? Did he leave the school?
Um, the chairman?
No, I don't know...
She's right, w-where is he?
Who knows?
Did he find a job? Is he going to graduate? Is he repeating a year?
Wait, what year was he in to begin with?
I'm still here.
You needn't be so startled.
You always startle me.
Because of a guilty conscience?
Not in the least!
That means you can rest at ease.
I have an announcement to make.
What?
I think I'll retire as chairman.
That's a very sudden and weighty announcement.
I figured I would get around to graduating.
Get around to? After how long?
T-Then he hasn't thought about it until n-now?
I plan to spend all year writing my graduation thesis.
I've gathered plenty of data.
What data?
Therefore I'd like to recommend Madarame as the next chairman.
What, me?
Oh, good idea.
It essentially already feels that way anyway.
A-And the only other senior is Haraguchi...
Don't worry.
I myself left all the practicalities to Tanaka anyway.
Oh... then maybe we should offer it to Tanaka first...
Just do it. You're qualified.
Yeah? Okay then...
I'll give it a go...
Congratulations, you're our second chairman.
The second?
That's all? The second?
He's gone!
No Photographs, please Genshiken
All right, then.
Suioh University
What? Two people joined?
They're still just provisional.
I haven't even met them.
Even a club like this gets new members...
I wonder what they're like.
Oh.
Oh what?
Oh, right now...
What?
Uh, ah...
Ahh, so much for the surprise test...
Hey, new guys.
Um...
Hi there...
I'm Sawazaki.
My name is Kuchiki.
Please call me Coochy.
Not on your life!
Now, now.
As for me...
Oh forget it, whatever.
Come on now, Kasukabe.
You know, I guess I just don't have an otaku name.
I'm sorry, she's a mundane.
Oh, then she doesn't cosplay or anything.
Cosplay? You mean Ohno?
Did her cosplay dazzle you?
Kasukabe...
N-No, it meant nothing!
Don't get carried away, Kasukabe.
These guys are still new.
I realize that of course, Mr. Chairman!
But you know, you two should forget this club.
This room is actually haunted.
Huh?
By the ghost of the first chairman who died five years ago...
Cut that out!
The original chairman's still alive!
Don't act like he's dead!
It's not a lie, though!
I've kept quiet until now, but sometimes I see it.
A dog-like face wearing glasses floats by gaps in the bookshelves.
You can say that with a straight face?
Don't turn around, you two.
Huh?
There's a face in the shelf behind you...
Note: It's just an image.
Hey, that's enough of that!
Not bad, Saki.
Oh right, it really was made up.
Maybe.
Kasukabe's started messing with the newcomers right on schedule...
I have to put an end to this no matter what...
Yes, as the chairman!
Bar Kurokiya
Well, everyone...
Cheers.
Cheers!
Oh, you don't drink?
Then...
Nah, I was wondering if we were going to chug.
No, we don't.
Well that's a downer.
It's not a downer, it's just how we do things.
Excuse me!
What'll ya have?
Let's see.
A spring vegetable pizza, handmade egg rolls some tasty...
Uh, hey...
Oh, you want to order?
How about an assorted platter?
O-Okay, fried chicken, and...
Nooo!
No chicken for me!
I oppose the fried chicken!
T-Then, c-cancel the chicken.
Sure, with pleasure.
Instead, a p-pickled e-eggplant.
Yeees!
That's outfit's a Cecil, isn't it?
It's no surprise it looks good on you.
What do you mean, no surprise?
Not many people can dress well.
If we knew other, that'd be one thing...
But I'm the type who thinks a guy complimenting my clothes...
But that's not true.
Don't waste your time.
What?
I'm just here to keep an eye on Kohsaka.
Oh, is that so?
It doesn't look that way at all.
What do you mean by that?
Ah, well, I guess you just look like friends.
That's none of your business.
I'm sorry, it was just a question.
You should know that...
Oh come on.
Let's enjoy ourselves.
Ohno.
What'll you have next?
Um, um, another one of these.
Excuse me!
You got it!
Which will it be, as God in heaven says.
Hey.
Start a conversation.
Aren't y-you the ch-chairman?
Kuchiki?
W-What made you decide to join us?
You see...
Probably Ohno and her cosplay.
Leave well alone with a ten-foot pole!
Not just that, or rather what besides that?
Let's see...
I've embraced a strong and profound interest in...
Hey, what'll you have next?
O-Okay, a cassis orange.
Excuse me!
Coming up!
So I decided to take this chance on entering college to...
Here's your spring vegetable pizza and tasty potato croquettes.
All right.
Those are mine, mine, mine!
He's hogging them?
Delicious!
I guess he's come out of his shell.
You don't drink?
That's not it.
Beer might as well be water.
I've been drinking it since high school.
I really don't like how otaku-ish the manga and anime clubs are.
We have our share of otaku too.
But you have girl members.
That alone makes you completely different.
Just between us, I also scoped out the Manga Club.
What a waste.
It's almost all lardass pigs.
I wouldn't know...
Anime is Japan's culture these days.
Simply enjoying it is stupid.
Being able to study it more as culture this way, it's like, when a culture's...
Uhh...
Um, a subculture?
Yes! That's it, a subculture!
Right...
Did you know?
These days anime films are invited to be shown at Cannes...
No, I didn't know that.
This much is to be expected.
Hey, what's that? What's that?
It's a cassis orange.
Cassis orange?
Yes.
Let me try a quick sip.
I like!
Excuse me, Miss!
Coming up!
A cassis orange, cassis orange!
Gladly!
Want me to finish that?
No, that's okay.
Here's your cassis orange.
Excuse me.
What can I get you?
A double sweet-potato shochu, on the rocks.
You got it!
Excuse me, could I get some shochu too?
You got it!
There's been a shochu boom lately.
They say good shochu is better than sake.
Is that so?
Aha, I might not look it but I keep up with fashion.
Let's go find some good shochu to drink sometime.
I'll scope out a good place.
Right...
I've got to go to the bathroom...
A drinking party?
That's a rarity.
More or less.
How many joined?
Two, but they're provisional.
That's not very many. Is Genshiken doing okay?
The Manga Club reserved a private room, but it's still full.
We're just swelling with members.
Right...
I heard the news.
You're the chairman now?
Well, so it seems...
Well, even if I got passed over...
Sorry about that.
In a way, I aim to be a guardian for Genshiken.
So, if you have any problems just tell me.
I'll help you out.
Ohno.
Are you all right?
It's good!
Want some, Saki?
No thanks.
How much can she drink?
Don't you think guys who let themselves go...
It doesn't really mean they've let themselves go...
How d'you figure?
Y'know what...
A-Are you okay?
I'll go with him.
Huh, why you?
Sasahara can do it.
Have a drink, Saki.
I said no thanks.
Aren't you drinking too much?
Are you worried about me?
I love you, Saki.
Yes, of course.
I'm happy we can drink together.
I'm not drinking, you're the only one who is.
Then you should drink some too.
Not the shochu.
But beer, that I can do.
I love you, Saki!
Come on, let's go.
Don't forget anything.
Two hearts in balance.
Kujibiki unbalance.
Love, dreams, yearning...
Hey, are you all right? Want me to bring some water?
I'm all good, no problem!
Come on, Saki. Drink, drink.
Yes, yes, I'm drinking.
Drink more!
Give me a break!
Coochy! Shut up!
Sir, this is your last chance to order anything.
Would you care to?
Saki!
Are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
I think we've had enough.
You got it.
Tanaka, w-we're leaving.
Sawazaki, you look pretty bad!
I'm takin' a dump!
Thank you so much!
You okay?
You still don't look good.
Nah, I'm fine now!
What now? Call it a night?
Let's go to the next place! Okay?
But...
I want us to be together more!
But there's nowhere open this late.
Then come to my place.
What?
There's plenty of sitting room.
Thanks for having us.
Thanks for nothing.
Hey, new guy, this is not your room.
It's all good, we're in the same club and all.
You're still just provisional.
Oh, I like it well enough, I think I'll join.
Then let's have a test.
An admission test.
If you beat Kohsaka in a fighting game or whatever...
That sounds good. I'm pretty into fighting games.
Splendid.
Want to give it a shot?
Okay, I'll do it.
Don't do it, man, seriously.
Let's do this.
I'll go easy since it's a friendly match.
Don't go easy, just play the way you always do.
But...
The way you always do, like that Puyo Pop time.
Right...
Guilty Gear Isuka, huh?
That just came out.
Have you played a lot in arcades?
Here and there.
I'll show them the difference between a poser and the real thing!
Jam Kuradoberi make her entrance!
A throw chained into an air combo!?
Which one are you?
The guy.
Damn, he's reading my Roman Cancel!
Whoa, a Dust into a D-loop?
Did Kohsaka win?
It's a one-match game, so why not try again?
Son of a bitch!
Did he win?
Yes, yes, he won.
I guess it makes you happy when your boyfriend wins at games?
I suppose so.
You're not too bad.
You'd say that after perfect-ing me twice?
Don't forget, you've been drinking tonight.
You're absolutely right!
You didn't drink at all, and I drank a lot!
Of course you'd play better than me.
Want to play again?
You're on.
All right!
What?
I'm going to cheer for him.
Kick his butt, Kohsaka!
Come on, Kasukabe! Not in front of everyone!
If you win the next one, I'll kiss you.
Hey!
Are you sure that's cool?
What's your problem? You don't have to shout.
This has nothing to do with the test!
Oh, the test, you're right.
Then, if he beats Kohsaka, I'll even kiss the new guy.
There she goes again.
Suioh University
Hey, where's your next lecture?
What's wrong?
I could've sworn that was...
Do you remember?
Our childhood...
Where, where?
Genshiken
Are you alright?
Yeah...
You don't have one, Kohsaka?
Not at all.
I've got it.
What?
If we do the Kohsaka test every year, I can smash Genshiken.
Right, Mr. Chairman?
We took no detours or shortcuts...
Only vivid dreams extended deep into the shadows.
We aren't quite grown up.
Simple but complicated glistening like marbles.
The time we could see from there sparkled, even if nothing big happened.
What we see from the marbles in our hands now is a little different...
Sasahara, you don't go for the little sister image.
Yeah, I guess I would have to pick the childhood friend image.
What about maids?
Good stuff! What about maids?
I might not have brought it up before, but I like girls with cat ears too.
I think bandaged girls are what I dig.
How about a girl who's class president?
A- Ok! How about a girl who's class president?
I wonder if there are any characters like that in games or anime.
A childhood friend cat-eared maid...
That's so awesome!
