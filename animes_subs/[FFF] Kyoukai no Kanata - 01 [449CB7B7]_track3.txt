Suicide.
The act of taking one's own life,
is the definition you might find in a dictionary.
Personally, I think I'll get through life without ever attempting to commit suicide.
Not to uphold a moral standard,
but because of a much simpler reason...
which I'll tell you later!
There's a girl who's about to plunge to her death!
The navy blue ribbon of a new student flutters in the wind.
Here, the road forks and the story's plot must continue on one of two paths.
On one path, the protagonist becomes an active character
and helps move the story along.
On the other, the protagonist remains passive
and leaves the story to carry itself.
Normally, I would have remained a passive character,
but for whatever reason, I chose to take the former path!
E-Excuse me!
I'll leave out the exact words I chose at the moment, but...
Either way, someone who looks as good in glasses as you do...
just doesn't deserve to die!
I laid my feelings bare as I said something along those lines.
Then, I poured as much emotion as I could
into one, big finale.
In short, I love girls with glasses!
How unpleasant.
You
I-I was too much for you.
Uh...
Say...
Do you think you could do something about this?
Pretty please?
What in the world are you?
I-I could ask you the same right now.
That's how I met Kuriyama Mirai.
If our storyif you could call it onecould've simply ended here,
then all the world's lore would've never come to be.
Could you put these glasses on?
Loneliness makes my cheeks wet

A dismembered body, huh?

You won't be able to draw the readers in
by simply making all of the murders extremely grotesque.
Then what type of murder should I go for?
We found the body torn to...
It was hardly in any
condition for us to work on.
the crime.
We found the body torn to...
It was hardly in any
condition for us to work on.
the crime.
I think that the murderer's actions and logic
are what makes it interesting for the reader.
I despise characters that go,
Let's dismember him! just for the sake of being cool.
This okay?
Yes, that's fine.
Akihito, your friends in the Literary Club
put their hearts and souls into those scraps of paper.
It's rude to toy with them like that.
The way you said that makes me think you don't respect them one bit.
Keep Calm
And Drive On
Can you blame me?
You went up to our adviser and said,
We'll hit Volume 150 with our next anthology.

And you were the one who told me to go talk to her, Mitsuki!
How about this?
It's a mystery that has a weak motive,
a clumsy forensic investigation, and a twist.
If that's all you remember about it, you can toss it out.
This one's a fairy tale, but it was rather interesting.
What's it called?
I Took Off My Red Riding Hood.
Then she'll just be like any other girl!
Kuriyama Mirai?
Probably.
Are you trying to ditch and leave me with the screening process?
I'll be right back.
Ouch...
Huh? Kuriyama-san, whatever are you doing in a place like this?
It's quite the coincidence, isn't it?
It sure is.
Coincidence, my ass! No way this is just a coincidence!
How unpleasant!
What were you doing?
Uh...
Well...
Wiping your glasses won't help you come up with an excuse.
I-I wasn't trying to come up with an excuse!
Your reaction is telling me otherwise.
Th-That's because you're making strange accusations, Senpai!
Don't you think it's about time you gave up?
As I've already told you, I'm immortal.
No matter how many times you stab me or even fatally wound me,
you can't kill me.
Wh-Whatever are you talking about?
You suck at playing dumb!
Do you realize how many times you've stabbed me
in the past week, Kuriyama-san?
One, two, six...
It takes two hands?!
It's your fault, Senpai!
I've never heard of someone who was possessed by a demon
and can take countless fatal blows!
I've already told you!
I'm not possessed by a demon.
I'm half -demon.
I'm a rare entity, born from a human and a demon.
Then does it really matter?
What do you mean?
No matter how many times I stab you, you come right back.
Now listen here!
I'm not some low-level slime enemy from a video game!
Regardless, as long as I am an Exterminator and you're a demon,
there is nothing wrong with what I'm doing.
Goodbye.
Ouch!
Ouch...
How did it go?
No progress!
Akihito...
What is it?
If you slack off,
your dream of me confessing my feelings for you
at graduation won't come true.
When did that become my dream?
Oh, did you want to confess to me?
That's not what I meant!
I'm saying that you've got the whole premise completely wrong!
You'll have to pardon me.
You're an unscrupulous pervert who'd go for anyone with a big rack.
I guess there's no reason for you to be hung up on me, huh?
You are going to have a problem
if you won't drop your habit of teasing me.
It's not so much of a habit as it is a part of my daily routine.
Even if it means being scolded,
I can't escape from the duty that has been handed down to me.
Stop sounding so serious about it!
Why don't you let her stab you as much as she likes?
I'll have to pass!
I may be immortal, but I can still feel pain.
Just thinking about the agony of having my innards gouged out...
Really? Sounds like it would be perfect for a masochistic freak.
Don't label me a masochist.
Why does she have to be so persistent, anyway?
You really can't guess?
If I had to guess...
Is it love?!
How wonderful!
To be loved by a girl who looks great in any glasses...
This is why I don't toy with perverts' grand delusions.
Well, at any rate...
You should avoid any further interactions with Kuriyama Mirai.
Why's that?
The Nase family has jurisdiction over the Exterminators in this district,
and their daughter is giving you a word of advice.
If that doesn't spell things out clearly enough,
then you're stupid.
Doesn't doing this every day get old?
Plan on going at it again today?
Why do you always stay so late after school, Senpai?
It'd suck if I went home earlier
and you attacked me in front of the other students.
If that's the case, you can rest at ease!
I made sure that we'd be alone.
Well, thanks for the consideration.
But I've never heard of anyone manipulating their blood
and using it as a sword.
Among the Exterminators,
we were loathed as a cursed clan.
Why?
I think it's because we were too powerful.
Since the Exterminators possess abnormal powers,
we have a tendency to want to eliminate
any who are exceedingly powerful.
As a result, my clan died off.
I am the last survivor.
What a tragic story.
Is that so? I think it's...
a rather common one.
Let's commence the battle!
Fine. But first I have something I'd like to ask.
Why are you so hung up on me?
Oh, come on!
Wh-Why are you running from me?!
I'm not running! This is a tactical retreat!
We've already proven time after time that I can't beat you!
I can't believe this!
Wait, Senpai!
Did I lose her?
Where did you come from?!
Eat this!
Take this!
Hey! You made me kill the bucket!
Really?
I think it's about time you called it quits.
What is this, a horror movie?
I-It's dark! What did you do, Senpai?!
It's just a bucket.
Are you hungry?
S-Senpai!
A demon...
R-Right!
Move it!
I heard that part of our club activities includes running!
Crap!
Kanbara-kun, I'm sorry!
Sorry for throwing this on you, but could you give the Cleaners a call?
You were planning to anyway, weren't you?
Later!
Who was that just now?
Ninomiya Shizuku.
Nino-san for short.
She's sort of a famous Exterminator around these parts.
Is that so?
You've never defeated a demon?
I'm not that bad.
But it's close to zero.
Even though you're an Exterminator?
I've already told you!
My clan is loathed because of its ability to manipulate blood.
So I've been avoiding anything to do with subduing demons
in order to keep my powers a secret.
Besides...
Besides?
It's nothing.
So you decided that I'm a demon,
mustered up your courage, and attacked me!
And then you told me that you're immortal...
That means I can stab you all I want and you won't die!
I wasn't accustomed to taking down demons, so...
Wait... So you've been using me as a training dummy?
Why not? You've got nothing to lose!
Well, I do!
That crap is literally tearing up my heart!
I told you! I'm not immune to pain!
Do you have any idea how much that hurts?
If you think you can do whatever you want just because I'm immortal,
I'll cry discrimination!
The other people here can hear you.
Not a problem!
I've already checked to make sure no one's around.
Thank you for waiting!
Here are the additional burrito, mole poblano,
and chili con carne combos you ordered.
Please enjoy yourselves!
You ordered more food?!
You're being unpleasant.
I'm the one finding this unpleasant!
First you use me as a punching bag,
and then you leech dinner off me!
Leech?
Isn't this what we agreed on?
I won't challenge you to any more fights today,
and in exchange, you'll treat me to dinner.
Judging by your choice of words,
is it safe to assume you'll attack me again tomorrow?
Isn't the deal just for today?
It's true that demons possess humans and cause casualties,
but for those with Exterminator powers, they aren't
all that hard to deal with.
At the very least, they should be easier than stabbing me.
I know that.
Then why don't you go after them?
Kuriyama-san!
Thank you for dinner!
I know that.
I wonder what her problem is.
Thank you!
Yeah! Be sure to eat up!
Kanbara, eating in the cafeteria?
Yeah! I do every now and then.
What kind of change-of-heart
made you want to meet in the cafeteria?
You make it sound as if I normally shut myself up in the clubroom.
So you're saying you don't?
Very well! I won't deny it.
I'm leading a pathetic school life where I eat
in the bathroom by myself and the only person
I'm able to abuse is my childhood friend, Akihito.
Wait! Is it just me, or did you make it sound like,
between the two of us, I'm more pathetic?
Well then, it's about time we moved onto the main point.
You can't get to your point without an introduction, can you?
I won't be attending our club meeting today.
You called me down here just to tell me that?
Yes. So everything I say from here on is just me talking to myself.
Got it?
Yeah.
Could you keep quiet when I'm talking to myself?
What do you say?
Which do you want?!
The Nase family is keeping an eye on Kuriyama Mirai.
Why?
Throughout the generations, the leader of the land
has always been unwelcoming and conservative.
What exactly does that mean?
Cease all further interaction with Kuriyama Mirai.
Despite my warning, you're still going to get involved with her, huh?
Probably.
But hey, I'm immortal!
No matter what happens, it's not like I'll die.
If only you could die...
What are you going to do today?
I'd like to talk to you.
Here! That'll be 390 yen.
Then I'll give you 500 yen.
Huh?
Um...
I'm sorry about that.
Don't sweat it, really.
So, what did you want to talk about?
Well, I was wondering if there's a reason why
you decided to come to this town.
None in particular.
Why do you ask?
To be honest, someone told me
not to get involved with you.
Kuriyama-sa
So what if people hate me?!
Good job on starting a shitstorm

You're right.
I know.
Ah, kidding! Kidding! Just kidding!
I swear I'll look you up later and white knight you!
Man, this'll be a blast!
Wait! Back to the reason why you're here!
You really don't have a reason for coming?
Even if I did, do you think I'd tell you here and now?
In other words, you do have a reason?
I won't fall for any loaded questions.
You should eat at home.
Is there some reason why you can't eat at home?
Glasses
Wh-Why do you ask?
I couldn't possibly have anything like that going on!
You're an open book!
You're unpleasant!
Were you unable to pay your rent?
I managed to make this month's payment!
Your apartment is so covered in garbage that you can't get in?
I keep it clean!
Then... do you have a demon in your apartment?
D-Do you really think that's even possible?
Th-That the exact room I moved into
just so happened to have a demon living inside?
I see.
Well, they do say that an Exterminator's powers can attract demons.
W-Wait just one minute!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going to come and help you take it down.
You'll get some money out of the deal.
And once you've grown more confident in yourself,
I won't have to worry about you stabbing me.
I don't want to.
And why not?
I'm scared.
I'm afraid of taking its life.
Then why don't you quit being an Exterminator?
If I could quit...
If I could quit, I would have a long time ago!
I tried to quit!
I tried leading a normal life,
one free of being an Exterminator and defeating demons!
But the cursed blood running through my veins isn't normal!
This power is...
I'm the same way.
Just a moment, please.
Notice anything?
Not in particular.
But...
Get ready.
Kuriyama-san!
It got away!
Down!
The demon!

Kuriyama-san, aren't you going to join a club?
Ultramarine
Ultramarine
Ultramarine
I don't have time for one.
Are you interested in the Literary Club?
I'll pass.
Huh? Why?
I don't care to interact with others.
