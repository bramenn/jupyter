Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
Wow! Our house is all fixed now!
Amazing!
Unbelievable! So this is the full power of a goddess, huh?
You actually restored our house and the whole city in an instant!
Well, I did cause everyone a lot of trouble...
But...
Now that the Lord of Terror is no longer a threat...
Belldandy...
Summoning electricity!
Oh, my. I guess Urd's playing tag with Skuld again.
So this is the first thing she does the minute her license is reinstated...
I've got you cornered, now!
What the heck is... I've got you cornered, now!
You're going down!
Ah! Urd's Little Romance
Oh, man...slippery-smooth and totally flat!
But why'd she turn into a child?
To live in this world, we goddesses must draw on an energy supply...
Oh, that's right!
The system crashed during the Lord of Terror incident, so...
In Urd's case, I think that's how the energy deficiency manifested itself.
So if she keeps on using her powers, she's only going to get smaller?
Oh no, we goddesses have alternate energy sources for emergencies.
Alternate energy source?
Ah, the heck with you! Goshdarnit!
Let me guess...could it be sake?
Huh?
Belldandy!
In Big Sister's case, it's sleep.
Huh?
I see.
She did use her full power just now to fix the whole town.
Big Sister...
Come to think of it, you seem fine, Skuld.
Oh, I'm totally fine!
Sure, because she has no powers to speak of!
The grownups are talking right now, kid!
But listen, Urd, I'll play with you later!
You've really got some nerve!
Is that a good idea, using your powers?
Urd!
Hey, why don't we do something about your clothes?
But what kind of clothes should we buy?
I know, we can get her something at the neighborhood thrift shop!
Belldandy!
To conserve energy, I've split off from myself.
Anyway, let's go get some clothes for Urd!
Sure.
Urd's Castle
How do I look?
Hey, I think it rather becomes me!
You mean she actually likes it?
Looks like it!
I'm going out now.
Fine! I'm going out now.
The Almighty!
This is cool!
Hey, it's really cool! Come on, come on!
There!
Hey, you!
Uh...my cram school class has been canceled today.
It's not as if I always hang out here... it's just a coincidence...
Sake's not for children!
Oh, no, it's not sake, it's a video game...
Look, you've got it all wrong. I told you, I'm not a child!
Drinking sake in broad daylight...
What in the world are your parents thinking?
Well, they do like to take the hands-off approach...
Come with me to the station!
Didn't you hear me? I'm NOT a child!
Don't be ridiculous!
Man, what a pain in the butt.
What should I do now?
Huh?
Hang onto this for me!
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Is she a friend of yours?
Uh...um... Is she a friend of yours?
Hey!
Oh, rats. I just used up all my strength.
Are you all right?
He was nice enough to bring it to me!
But in any case...
Uh...listen...
Sake!
Huh?
Give me that sake.
Sake!
Ah! Nothing like a drink after a hard day's work!
Thanks. I owe you one!
Um, no problem...
But really, you're a little pushover, huh?
Running away with me like that!
Hey, but, isn't that why you were able to get away?
Oh, hey, you're right!
By the way, what were you doing just now?
Oh, nothing.
It's not like I was ditching cram school. There's no class today, so...
I'm talking about the game.
Huh? I'm talking about the game.
That's the one that just came out, right?
Oh, uh...well...
This is it.
Hmm...how do you play?
This is Button A, and this is Button B.
And this is the Start button, and here's Reset.
Want to give it a try?
Sure. Want to give it a try?
Here are the instructions...
That's all right. Here are the instructions...
I am a System Administrator goddess.
Huh?
All right, let's start!
I'm done.
Huh? I'm done.
What's next?
What?
You don't have any more?
Oh, uh...um...
Okay, then...try this one next.
All right!
I had a pretty good time!
No way...how could you beat them all?
Anyway, I think I'll head home now.
Oh...
See ya!
My name is Shohei Yoshida!
What's...
What's your name?
Urd.
Uh...um...Uru?
My name is Urd.
Uh, hey! Will you be here tomorrow, too?
If you're here, too!
Huh? What the...
Urd?
Urd?
Look at the time!
I'm really going to be late for cram school, now...
Hey...
Oh, cripes.
I forgot my sake.
Oh, whatever!
I'm home!
Are you going somewhere?
That's right. Great news, Urd!
Urd, we heard from the Almighty after you left the house.
From the Almighty?
He told us that we should use moon rocks as an alternate...
Right, they would definitely...
Hold on...how are we going to get our hands on moon rocks?
We're heading out to make some. The facilities we need are at school.
So we're going to gather up the materials.
Urd, you only have to hold on a little longer!
Well, there's no rush, really.
Being a kid is more fun than I thought.
She seems to be enjoying herself.
Yes, she does! She seems to be enjoying herself.
Hey!
What took you so long?
So what are we going to do today?
Today I've got some games that are way more difficult than yesterday's...
Come on!
Hey!
Hey! Hold on!
A volcano, did you say?
Right.
Moon rocks are mainly composed of a type of volcanic rock called basalt.
So all we need is to get some basalt?
Actually, Moon rocks have a slightly different composition than Earth rocks.
That's why we have to make them ourselves.
But once we do that, you two can go back to normal right away.
Going to all this trouble for us... I'm so sorry.
Don't be!
I mean, this is the one thing I can do for you...
I'm...so...wiped...
But even I'm not that out of breath!
Buy me some sake.
Um! But listen, I'm still...
Huh?
You see...um...you can't drink sake until you're an adult...
And I'm still in grammar school...
And even if it's a vending machine, I still shouldn't do it...
So that's why... I don't think I can...um...
Gotcha.
Come on! Let's go!
Yahoo!
Yahoo!
Falling down isn't my thing, see...
Okay, then! In that case...
Come on! You can do it, Shohei! You're almost there!
And don't look up, got that? Don't look up!
What are you talking about? Most people would say'Don't look down!'
Rats, what did I tell you?
That's exactly why I told you not to look up!
Right.
Thanks to you, I just got even smaller!
Huh?
Oh, nothing, just talking to myself!
I'm sorry I didn't buy your sake for you just now.
Oh, that was nothing.
It's time for cram school, so I'll be going now.
But it's still light out.
I've got early classes today.
Oh?
If you think you can't do something, you'll never be able to do it...
Come with me!
But...hey, wait! Hold on, Urd!
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY
Uh, um, what are you going to do?
Okay, it's open! Come on, let's go!
What? Go? Go where?
We're going to climb it, what did you think?
What!
Come on!
Hey, hold up a second!
All you have to do now is cross over here.
No way can I do that! If I fall, I'll be killed!
Then just don't fall.
Huh?
Didn't I just tell you?
If you think you can't do something, you'll never be able to do it...
But, saying that is one thing... if I really do fall...
But you did it yesterday!
My sake...you brought it to me, remember?
Come to think of it, at that time...
Why was I able to do something like that then?
Right...I've got to go after her.
No matter what happens!
Whoa!
This is amazing!
Isn't it?
I mean, from up there, this was the tallest building I could find...
Up there?
Oh, uh, nothing! Forget it, okay?
I think I might've gotten too involved...
Shouldn't you be heading for your cram school?
Oh, cripes.
Okay, I'll see you around!
Urd!
W-where do you live?
You are a foreigner, aren't you?
How long are you going to be in Japan?
Uh...well...
Sorry.
I'm not a child.
I told you when we met, remember? That I'm not a child...
Huh? What?
Urd...
Urd...
I'm home.
Look, they're done! The moon rocks!
You can turn back to your old self now. Isn't this wonderful, Urd?
Let's wait...until tomorrow.
Oh, boy, so he did follow me home.
Urd, don't tell me that you and that boy...
I thought I was just passing the time...
Urd...
Maybe it's best that I turn back now, after all...
TARIKI HONGAN TEMPLE
Can I help you? TARIKI HONGAN TEMPLE
Wait...are you a friend of my little sister's, maybe?
Yes!
If you came to see Urd, she's not here anymore.
Huh?
She went back to her own home, you see.
And she probably won't be coming back here.
I'm sorry.
That's not why I'm here.
What? That's not why I'm here.
This sake...
Could you please give this back to Urd for me?
Also, tell Urd that I said thank you...
That I'm going to stop giving up before I even try...
That I know I can hang in there...
And so, when I'm all grown up...
Whoa!
Yes. I promise you.
So grow up fast, all right?
All right!
SKULD LABORATORY
Huh?
AUGH!
TO BE CONTINUED
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a Wing!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a Wing!
I love you so much it hurts...
And it hurts me that I can't tell you how I feel.
You and I have matching hearts...
So we must share the same scars deep down inside.
But now that I'm in your arms, I think I can catch...
Nobody else matters... All we have to do is gaze at each other.
It's all right for your heart to flutter... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
Don't run away from happiness.

I just want you to be happy.
