When we were kids, there was a time that Manaka and I got lost.
We had gone to the outskirts of the village,
into the outer sea to look for coral,
and gotten so wrapped up that we couldn't find the way home.
Just as we got hungry, tired of walking,
and on the verge of tears...
The one who appeared in front of us
was Hikari.
Without saying a word,
Hikari just kept pulling on our hands.
Even now, I clearly remember his eyes focused straight
in front of him and the feeling of him holding my hand.
So...
I don't think I was too surprised when I heard
that Hikari had found Manaka.
I think I knew somewhere in my heart that it would happen.
Because I thought somewhere in my heart
that if someone were able to do that, it'd only be Hikari.
Episode Nineteen: The Lost, Lost Little...
Right...
At this rate, taking care of her here should be fine.
Really?!
Hikari!
Well, we've been examining her since yesterday,
and I'd have to say that she's pretty healthy.
There's nothing wrong with her brain waves, either,
and judging from you two who have already woken up,
she should wake up soon.
All right!
I told you, Akari!
There's nothing to worry about.
And her Ena may grow back.
Anyway, I'm just glad that Manaka's okay.
You think that, too, right?
Ow!
Akira!
Y-You little... Oh.
Doctor, Chisaki, thanks.
Hold it!
So lively... how nice.
Kancho!
You fool! Like I'd keep falling for the same attack!
At this rate, she won't be able to stay asleep either.
Special move: kancho reversal!
This is so embarrassing...
Th-This is...
Seriously...
Kancho reversal reversal!
Hikari... Must be really happy that he found Manaka.
Thank you very much.
Hiradaira-kun,
you can just have your self-study log in to me by tomorrow morning.
Yes, sir.
This is the first time I've seen you in your nurse outfit.
It looks good on you.
I almost didn't recognize you.
I still haven't gotten used to it.
Right now, it just feels like I'm just wearing the outfit.
Since you're here, want to have some tea?
I will, thank you.
Hey...
Manaka,
hurry and wake up.
The Ofunehiki...
Both Dad and Uroko-sama said it'd be useless...
But I was hoping for something the whole time.
Hoping that something would happen,
wanting something to happen.
And then something like that ended up happening...
Did you save Akari back there?
What happened back then?
You said that you had something
to tell me after the Ofunehiki was over, didn't you?
At the time, no matter how far I reached for you,
I couldn't reach you at all.
But now even if you want me to,
I'll never let go.
I see...
Miuna-chan also likes Hikari.
How cute...
Putting her all into caring for him,
but not being able to take the next step...
I always just thought of her as a child,
but that's right...
She's now the same age as we were back then.
I see...
I'm almost the same age as Akari-san was back then...
You still worried about the girlie from the sea village?
Yes...
I believe she'll wake up soon, but...
She lost some of her Ena, so...
Her Ena?
You said she was found sleeping at a graveyard of Ojoshi-samas, right?
Do you happen to know something?
There's a continuation to the story about the Sea God and Ojoshi-sama.
Continuation?
There aren't many who'll talk about it,
because it's a story with a sad ending.
Huh?
You haven't talked since you got back, have you?
Is something wrong?
Not really.
More importantly, Chisaki, how's Manaka doing?
I still haven't had a chance to go see her.
Right...
The doctor said that there's nothing to worry about.
Thank goodness...
Now you guys will have more data to conceal.
Conceal...
Apparently both Mihashi-sensei and Tsumugu aren't going to
officially present the details about the fact
that we were able to get into Shioshishio or about Miuna-chan for a while.
Really?
Yeah.
Mihashi-sensei will put it all in a thesis.
Then he'll send it to an academic journal,
and the official presentation comes after that.
I can't say that I agree to that.
Hikari, I, and Miuna-chan didn't dive
to Shioshishio and put our lives in danger for the sake of your reputation.
Hey, Tsumugu.
There is a reason for that, right?
If the thesis isn't acknowledged,
we won't receive funding anymore.
All his research to avert disaster
from occurring on the surface by establishing the link
between the abnormal weather and the sea village will cease.
And then the media will also get involved and
Miuna will go through a lot of trouble.
Jeez...
Tsumugu, you never explain enough.
Hey, Kaname.
Will you give him a chance?
There is a lot going on...
You're such an adult, Chisaki.
Thanks for the food.
Kaname, wai
Damn it.
An adult, huh...
Wow!
How nostalgic!
Huh?
Huh? You're kidding...
Take that!
Oh, no... It's...
Chisaki, the bath is getting cold.
R-Right. I'll be right there!
Whoa!
What's wrong?
Chisaki, I'm opening the door!
H-Hey, wait!
H-How long are you going to stare, you idiots!
S-Sorry!
Sorry.
Jeez...
Are you hungry?
Oh, it's just you, Tsumugu.
Jeez, don't scare me like that.
Pickled Shallots
Chile Oil
Marinated in Soy
Oh...
Um, I was just looking for Grandpa's plum wine.
You're still a minor.
It's fine!
I'm in the mood to drink some.
Since I'm an adult and some lonely housewife!
Just wait a sec.
I'll prepare it for you.
Plum Wine
That's not how you're supposed to drink it.
Hmph!
I was told that alcohol tastes better when you're an adult,
Plum Juice Without Shochu
but apparently that's true.
You're saying that after just drinking this...
Even if it's just plum wine, alcohol is alcohol!
Yeah... plum wine is.
Quit trying to act like an adult.
Give me more!
I feel great.
I want to see what Shioshishio looks like now.
Maybe I'll go.
Today,
Hikari was talking to Manaka while she slept.
That wasn't much of a shock, but...
I don't think I'll be able to have eyes like that ever again.
My body got all big on its own...
and yet things are spilling out.
Does becoming an adult mean you lose a lot of things?
You probably do lose a lot.
But that just means you need fulfill what you lost with new things.
Our time together these five years has been like that for me...
You don't plan on doing anything more than that, do you?
Yeah.
But we need to get her to bed.
Give me a hand.
R-Right.
I never did tell you, did I?
Tell me what?
My gratitude for saving me at the Ofunehiki.
Thank you.
It's not something to thank me for.
Just so you know, I'm not being modest.
At the time, it really crossed my mind...
If I just overlook it, you'll disappear.
And then I'll be able to be with Chisaki.
Don't save him.
Just abandon him.
But you dove in.
Also,
if you were able to just overlook something like that,
I'd never let you have Chisaki.
So the truth comes out.
Yeah.
But...
I really am grateful that you guys came back.
Things were suspended this whole time.
Now both Chisaki and I
can move forward.
I drank quite a bit, but I didn't get a hangover at all.
Maybe I'm pretty strong.
From this point, I dive down seven meters...
How to get to Shioshishio
I have to face it one day...
Then...
I'm being swept away a little...
Um...
Huh? You're kidding...
Chisaki!
Hikari?!
Are you okay?
Yeah, thanks.
You're always so careful,
but at times, you end up being really reckless.
Eh? You think so?
Anyway, what are you doing here?
What do you mean?
If we're able to get in now, of course I'd come to see...
Well, I guess you have a point.
When he held me back there, it surprised me.
He didn't feel rugged at all,
unlike the men I have to touch during self-study...
Of course...
Because his smile, his body, and his heart are...
Exactly the same as you were five years ago... aren't you?
Huh?
Of course you are.
For you, the Ofunehiki was really recent.
Well, yeah...
But you haven't changed either.
You're just the normal Chisaki.
You think so?
I thought I had changed quite a bit...
Nah, not at all.
You still look like you're listening and yet not listening at all.
That's not true!
Also, the fact that you get pissed off when I tease you a little.
What about you, Hikari?
What are you doing here so early in the morning?
Yeah...
I just couldn't stay put.
I keep wondering why
Manaka's Ena's disappearing.
I thought I might figure something out if I went back to where we found her.
I see...
I don't know if this will help or not,
but Tsumugu's grandfather told me a story.
The continuation of the story about the Sea God and Ojoshi-sama.
Continuation?
The girl that married the Sea God eventually had children,
and their descendants flourished.
However, as more time passed,
it's said that the girl became more and more depressed.
Because the girl had left behind someone she loved on the surface.
Because of the man she loved,
she was never able to forget about the surface.
After finding that out, the Sea God
did everything he could to make her happy.
But in the end, she wasn't able to forget about the surface,
so the Sea God had no choice
but to let her go back to the surface...
Taking something in return.
Something?
I've been thinking about it... but that might be Ena.
Hikari?
Ojoshi-sama...
in return for going to the surface...
Oh, sorry...
It was just a thought.
Grandpa also said that this was just oral lore,
so he's not sure if it's true or not.
All right!
Huh?
It's decided!
Huh?
Uroko-sama!
I'm going to find him and catch him.
Catch him?
I'm sure he knows whether this story is true or not.
And if it's true, he may know what needs to be done!
To tell you the truth,
I was at a loss,
but now I know what I need to do.
Thanks, Chisaki!
But man, the Sea God is such a selfish jerk.
Taking people's Ena because they don't obey him
and randomly giving people Ena...
What is he, a kid?
That might be...
Even after living hundreds and thousands of years,
he might not have changed at all...
Well, that probably has nothing to do with it.
It's not about position or age, but how you feel.
Feel...
I'm excited for Manaka to wake up.
I'll do something about her Ena no matter what,
and then help Tsumugu with the surface...
I'm not going to give up!
Oh... that's right.
I still do like Hikari after all.
And so, now that Manaka has returned,
our time that was frozen for the last five years finally started moving...
That's what I thought at the time...
But...
Even after a week had passed,
there were no signs that Manaka would awaken at all.
Manaka!
Don't princes do that often? Kiss the sleeping princess?
How dull...
What do you mean by that?
Maybe they don't want her to wake up?
