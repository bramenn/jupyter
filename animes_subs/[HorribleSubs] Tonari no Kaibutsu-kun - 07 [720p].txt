How'd your date go?
Uh...
It ended before it even started?
What?
I found it when I was going through some old albums.
Are you Haru-kun?
Nice to meet you.
I'll be taking care of you from now on.
I'm your Aunt Kyoko.
What makes us human?
Education,
language,
tool use, and
love.
I know, Haru-kun.
I'll cast a spell on you.
Yoshida-kun?
Yo, class rep.
Whatcha up to?
I have a meeting for the cultural festival.
What about you, Yoshida-kun?
Sunbathing Nagoya.
I don't think I've seen you since you asked about my balls.
Don't mention that!
The Distance Between Us
So, I've been working hard as the class rep.
I've been doing what I can, like you said.
Now I have more little tasks to do.
Why did I get assigned to the cultural festival committee?
Oh, I learned that from someone else.
Still, I feel better now.
Really? That's nice.
Uh-huh.
Why is that guy hitting on a girl at a time like this?
Oh, class rep.
Shizuku shot me down.
Huh? What?
You told her how you feel?
No, I didn't.
When you asked me how I felt about Shizuku,
that opened my eyes,
but I guess it's too late.
R-Really?
Goo
Good luck...
Huh?
If she didn't flat out reject you,
maybe you still have a chance.
You think so?
She looked like she was completely done with this problem set.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I also learned this from someone else.
You can't pick up water once it's spilled, so handle it carefully.
That's why I don't want to make a mistake.
Banana Juice
That's stupid.
Natsume?
If you have time to spend thinking of stuff like that,
go tell her how you feel.
Slide while the iron's hot.
Are you drunk?
And you used the wrong...
Banana juice wouldn't make me drunk!
So what if Mitty isn't very responsive?
That's what makes Mitty attractive.
That's why I can relax around her.
She's not interested in me,
so she doesn't call me phony or slutty
or anything stupid like that.
You're such a baby, Haru-kun.
If she shoots you down, keep on trying!
Stupid
loser!
Wh-What's her problem?
I keep getting in trouble with women these days.
Haru.
Wait.
Never mind.
Haru.
That's nothing new.
Business as usual.
That's no good, Haru.
Honestly, you keep breaking stuff.
It's such a waste.
Screw you, old lady.
Eh?
Hey, stupid kid!
Watch your mouth!
Lemme go!
Mitsuyoshi, stop it.
What? You're already done?
Wow, I'm impressed.
Good job, Haru-kun.
This doesn't mean anything.
Silly boy.
Why are you denying your own strengths?
Now listen to me, Haru.
Humans will wither away if they're always alone.
The only remedy would be
to seek out other people.
I hope you find the right person one day.
I hope you find someone
whose presence is enough
to soothe your pain.
Haru, get that bird off me.
You look like you're enjoying yourself, Haru.
Yep, I was thinking about a dead person.
Huh?
Clean up after yourself.
If you want to be accepted, you must first accept yourself.
I wonder why I still remember all these things.
I love you.
But just so you know...
You're not in love with me anymore, right?
I know that.
I just want to be with you.
Haru...
Whoa, there!
Oh, sorry.
As soon as I realized that I love you,
I started having these urges.
His actions don't match his words...
Let's go out?
I can see that you didn't understand a word I said.
But you said that you'd go out with me if I fell in love with you.
That's ancient history.
I don't see a problem.
This makes everyone happy.
Are you ignoring my feelings?
What am I supposed to do then?
You're the one who said you just wanted to be with me.
Are you an idiot?!
No man's gonna put up with that!
What are you trying to say?!
Give in! Give in! Give in! Give in!
Leave! Scram! Get lost!
After that,
I began to feel as though I were in constant danger.
Midterm Grades Freshmen 1st Yoshida Haru 2nd Mizutani Shizuku 3rd Sawada Riku 4th Kasano Masamune
Why...
Why can't I win?!
Well, I tried a little harder this time.
Just a little.
Damn him!
I'll win next time!
Am I a distraction now?
No.
I hope you find the right person one day.
I hope you find someone whose presence is enough
to soothe your pain.
Okay.
I'll have to try harder then.
Borderline
Above Average
Yikes, I barely passed.
By the way, Natsume-san has to take make-ups again.
Sasaki Seminar
Pass Before Graduation
I'll be posting the scores from the last mock exam.
Let me know if you want your results mailed.
Kaimei Academy...
The rich kid school.
You didn't do too well on the last mock exam, Mizutani-san.
By the way, how is
your beloved Haru-kun doing?
You have any nails?
Crap, I forgot the supplies.
I'll make a quick trip to the store.
Oh, what was his name?
Should you really be loafing around here?
Weren't you all hyped about handing out
flyers with Natsume-san to bond with the class?
Oh, everyone ran away when they saw me,
so she said we should part ways.
Didn't take long for her to turn on me.
I see.
Syoyo Festival
Oh, yeah.
These tickets are for you.
Shimoyanagi-kun gave them to me.
I let my guard down...
Haru, if you touch me without permission or
get too close again, I'll be upset.
It's your fault for distancing yourself
the moment I said I loved you.
Are you mocking me?
It's because you keep doing stuff like this!
So I should ask for permission first?
No!
Don't make me repeat myself, Haru!
If you refuse to give me my personal space,
I can't be with you.
How much space do I have to give you?
Around two meters.
Get real!
Can you at least respect my wishes?
Otherwise, I can't feel comfortable around you.
Dammit!
Can't get too close, can't touch her...
Am I a slug or something?
Why does this happen?!
C-Can you blame her?
Your behavior's been very abnormal.
Shizuku. Shizuku. Shizuku.
I don't see the problem.
Well, you see...
There's nothing more repulsive than being touched
by a guy you don't like.
I-Is that how it works?
This is hard...
What are you making over there?
A barricade.
Since a bunch of people will be coming.
I'm naming it Mizutani Shizuku.
You'll get in trouble.
Oh, look.
Mitty's back.
What?
We can't get a spot in building one?
Shh! Keep your voice down!
Our plan won't work then!
Try harder, Yana!
Wh-Why do I have to do this?!
We can't make any money if people don't come!
What are you talking about?
Uh-oh.
Crap...
Make money off the cultural festival?
Right.
We can just report our official sales,
and make a little more on the side.
I've heard that all the upperclassmen do it.
We heard about it from the ones on the baseball team.
So that's why they were so excited.
In that case, this would be more effective.
Oh, I see.
You're really smart, Mizutani-san!
I want a fifty percent cut.
But we really need a spot in building one.
Is there a problem?
Everyone wants a good spot,
and Yana's scared of the upperclassmen.
Stupid...
They're intimidating, man!
The third-year class reps all have scary faces!
You should beat them up.
Then we'll start taking requests for building one.
3-A wants a spot on the south side of the first floor.
3-D wants a spot by the stairwell on the first floor.
2-C also wants a spot on the first floor.
Second-years don't get no say!
D-Doesn't look like the first-years have any chance.
I'll kill you, fool!
I-I'm sorry!
Y-Yeah...
1-B wants a spot by the first floor entrance.
Mi-Mizutani-san?!
You really shouldn't...
1-B wants a spot by the first floor entrance.
Got a problem?
I told Haru not to go crazy...
Worried
Hey, Yoshida.
If you get too uppity...
assigned to a corner in building 2
Final
What? That's the worst possible spot.
I'm sorry.
Yoshida-kun.
Yo, class rep.
Are you okay? You're all banged up.
Sure.
I heard that your class got put in building two.
Yeah, looks like it.
Sasayan and some other guys went to file a protest.
I have to pull weeds until the festival starts.
Nagoya
I was wondering... What is that?
A barricade.
I named it Mizutani Shizuku.
Mizutani-san won't like that...
Shizuku was mad at me.
She told me not to fight before we went in.
Th-That's not right, Yoshida-kun.
You should be sorry about making trouble
for your classmates.
And, if you care about Mizutani-san,
you should learn to solve things without violence.
Huh?
Mizutani-san was mad
because she was worried about you
doing dangerous things for her sake.
R-Really?!
I could have sworn she was mad because I ruined her plans!
B-Bye.
I'll be going then.
I fell in love with the wrong person...
Oh. Wait, class rep.
You said that you didn't like yourself, right?
I don't get that.
I don't see what's not to like.
Yo
Yoshida-kun.
My name isn't class rep.
It's not class rep...
It's Oshima.
Yeah, Oshima.
Yoshida-kun, the other day,
you said that you didn't want to make a mistake,
but I think I'm willing to take that risk,
because I'm not ready to give up yet.
When did I say that?
Am I really that forgettable?!
Well, I'm not sure I get it, but good luck anyway.
Why am I hiding?
Poster Color Set Paint Nails Don't forget anything
Do we really need
That's a relief.
We couldn't get a spot in building one,
three people to buy this stuff?
but at least they moved us to the first floor of building two.
Sorry, can I stop by my cram school?
What? We'll come with you.
Fine with me.
Why do they like moving around in groups?
I bet Haru-kun's feeling lonely right now.
There! Learned your lesson now?
Hey! It's you guys!
Hey, Sasayan!
Long time no see!
Wait, you guys actually go to school?
Natsume-chan is here too!
What were they doing?
Yo, Mizutani-san.
You wanted to check your scores?
Sasaki Seminar
Pass Before Graduation
What? You're not Haru's girlfriend?
Why not?
How am I supposed to answer that?
The only reason I can give is that I need to study.
That's a boring way to live.
I don't need you people lecturing me.
Don't lump me in with those fools.
They're no more than idiots.
Don't you enjoy watching people who aren't as smart as you?
Really?
When I watch them, I feel like I'm falling behind.
It worries me.
1st Mizutani Shizuku 3rd Yamaguchi Kenji
Well, it certainly feels good to look down on other people.
That's a boring way to live.
It's okay.
I'm doing the right thing.
We're begging you!
One! Just one!
Please give us a ticket to the cultural festival!
N-No way!
I'm saving these for the new friends I make
at my Nobody Visits My Site offline event!
Sorry, I gave all mine to my middle school buddies.
Co-ed schools can die!
See?
Isn't it amusing to watch stupid people?
They're pitiful.
Yamaken!
Acting all snobby again?
You people make too much noise.
You can have these.
I don't need them.
If Haru were here,
he would have done the same thing.
You're a goddess, studybug!
Studybug! Studybug! Studybug!
Sorry, but she gave them to me.
She never said to share them with you.
Are you a devil, Yamaken?!
Haru.
Yo, Shizuku.
Fancy meeting you here.
Did you enjoy shopping with lots of people?
I stopped by the batting center,
and Mi-chan-san said that you went to buy dinner.
Here, this is from Natsume-san.
Shizuku.
Why were you looking for me?
To give you that.
Oh, I see...
I'm not going to fall in love with you.
What's this about?
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?
It would be cruelest to keep your hopes up
when I already know the answer.
Fine.
I just have to change your mind.
Give me the bag.
There's nothing more repulsive than being touched
by a guy you don't like.
That was close...
I'm going home!
I didn't make a mistake.
I'm doing the right thing.
I'm doing the right thing...
So...
Why...
Why is this happening again?
Stay calm. Stay calm. Stay calm.
Save money Loan paid off!!
Hey, Haru.
Don't you want any takoyaki?
Nope, you can have them.
What's this?
Natsume gave it to me.
I'm supposed to drink it if I feel irritated.
Shizuku's so cute.
I'm going home!
What was that about?
Oh, that's nice.
The springtime of your life.
Well... Good luck, Haru.
Yeah.
The coop has been powered up!
A barricade of barbed wire?
How does he get inside?
How does he get out then?!
So this is what it means to be barrier free!

You're so smart, Tomio.
