Dream of life
Huh?
It feels like it's lost some of its oomph compared to when it was in NEXT.
It looks much better than the NEXT one-shot!
It's pretty good, but it's going to take some work to keep it from getting boring if it gets serialized.
I'm excited to see what happens next. It's perfect for a serialization.
It's...
I'm looking forward to tomorrow's serialization committee!
It'll be okay... right?
May I come in?
My name is Takagi Akito. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Oh, ahem. I'm Kaya's father.
We've been dating since middle school, and now we're in the same college.
W-Well, have a seat.
Th-Thank you.
Hey, can we stop? This is pretty embarrassing.
We can practice the greeting after we get serialized!
Besides, I don't even know what your dad's like!
Jeez, you're too shy.
Ad-libbing isn't working!
He's the CEO of a company, isn't he?
Yeah, but it's only a small real estate company in Yakusa.
So you're the only daughter of a CEO?
Yeah.
He also teaches karate in a nearby dojo.
You'd better prepare yourself.
Don't scare me.
We've got both a serialization and a marriage riding on what happens today.
I'm at a crossroads in life.
Ta-da! A marriage registration!
You already got one?!
You jumped the gun!
What's wrong? This is how you get registered!
We can only do that after we get serialized and get permission from our parents!
It's fine to get the form in advance!
3:13 Takahama
It's all about a man's technique!
Well, I mean his manga technique.
Oh you, Nakai.
Katou, what do you think of a guy who has technique?
I'm talking about manga, of course.
What? What's with that question?
Um, I haven't mentioned this,
but Business Boy Kenichi might be canceled in today's serialization meeting.
I didn't know.
If it does end, we'll have to part ways with each other again.
Part ways?
But even if it ends, we can still see each other, right?
Yeah, since we've gotten to know each other, we could talk on the phone sometimes.
Only on the phone?
Well, meeting up would be kind of weird... we're not dating, or anything.
Natsumi, is that all you felt for me?
R-Right, there's no way you would have feelings for me...
Me and you? Please don't joke about that.
Besides, I prefer younger men.
But I was pretty serious about you.
Oh, there you go again...
You really shouldn't.
Please don't have this conversation here!
Right! I'm sorry!
This is the first time I've seen Takahama get angry.
Since he's this irritated, it must mean Business Boy Kenichi is in deep trouble.
My stomach hurts!
Miura, don't be so uptight.
Only eight storyboards were submitted, so even if only two pass, that means you already have a 25 chance.
And judging by Tanto's quality, I'd say it's a 50 chance.
Arai's is definitely in, so if two new ones start up, you'll only have a 1 in 7 chance of being the other one.
Yamahisa, that's enough out of you.
Scary.
And I told Ashirogi that they only needed three solid chapters to pass for sure...
If they don't get serialized, then...
Congratulations! Time of Blue Leaves will start its serialization in the second issue of the new year!
Really? Thank you!
Everyone thinks it's much better than the NEXT one-shot.
It's like a surprise comeback!
It's all thanks to Fukuda and everyone... I have to thank them properly.
Unlike in your previous series where you only did the manuscript,
this time you'll need a few assistants to help you.
Can they work at your home?
Yes, I'll manage.
But I'd like all female assistants, if possible.
I understand. I'll arrange it as quickly as possible.
What? Only four more chapters?
The new serializations are... Time of Blue Leaves, and...
Miura, I don't need to know what's starting.
Time of Blue Leaves... that's Aoki...
You two can leave for today.
I want to be alone for a while.
Okay.
Have a good evening.
Dammit!
What?!
It didn't pass?
Hey, don't get so down.
We just have to make it even better and submit it to the next committee.
It'll definitely pass next time...
But you said it would pass as long as we had three chapters.
They just have really high expectations for you guys.
This was a good thing.
You could even say it was for the best...
Ah, sorry, but Business Boy Kenichi is ending, so I have to go meet with Takahama.
Business Boy Kenichi was canceled?
Maybe he was too young...
Is that how it is?
I knew getting a serialization wasn't going to be that easy.
Why didn't it pass? Isn't it strange?
Takagi, you didn't want to get married, so you let the quality slip!
I'd never do that!
Who's starting?
Arai and Aoki.
She is?
She got ahead of us.
Miura's too optimistic.
It concerns me that Takahama's also ended.
We've got the same editor.
But it was thanks to Miura that we got 1st place in NEXT!
We've got no choice but to trust him!
Right, we'll definitely get serialized next time.
Let's have faith in that and keep our heads up!
Yeah!
My marriage got pushed off.
S-Sorry.
It's ending. Only four more chapters.
Katou, before it ends, there's something I want to clarify...
I'm sorry! I can't have a special relationship with you.
No way... Is this the end?
I know! Aoki's got a new serialization.
She should need assistants now...
After that happened, I can't...
No, it'll only be for work.
If I say I'll just be an assistant...
This is Nakai.
I heard you got serialized, and I thought you might be needing assistants.
Not drawing the art, just assisting...
I think there's something else you should say to me before that.
But even if you apologized, I've decided that all of my assistants will be female,
so there wouldn't be much of a point.
Y-You won't reconsider?
The serialization I was assisting with is ending,
and Natsumi and I will part ways when it's over...
Goodbye. Please do not call me again.
You rejected Nakai?
I told him I wouldn't have a special relationship with him.
Is that why...
Nakai's going back to the country?!
Yeah, I just called him, and he said he's quitting manga and going back home!
Because he was rejected by Katou?
And Aoki before that.
Even though he's that kind of person, there aren't many people with art as good as his.
We should try to stop him...
Th-Thanks for telling us.
So it's Mashiro this time?
Why are you going back home?
Your art is great!
It's such a waste!
That art led me down the wrong path.
I abused it.
I'm disgusted with myself.
B-But...
There's no use trying to stop me.
Tomorrow, I'm clearing out everything and leaving.
Bye.
Nakai!
He hung up on me.
What should we do?
I don't feel like stopping him.
He's done some bad stuff.
It serves him right.
Shujin.
That's cold.
I'm going home to think of some gags. See ya.
I'll definitely get serialized!
We can't do anything unless Nakai works up some resolve himself.
Anything we try would just be butting into his business, and wouldn't accomplish anything.
I can't stop him. I told him never to call me again yesterday.
It's like Shujin said. It serves him right, huh?
Nakai.
Mashiro.
My hometown's a place called Akita.
They grow apples and rice.
I'll send you a bunch of apples.
Please don't leave.
You're the one who taught me the basics of backgrounds!
I see. Then I'm glad I drew manga, if only for that.
Like you, all I can do is draw!
You were my inspiration!
Don't... don't give up on your dream!
Thanks.
But like I said yesterday, I don't have the right to draw manga anymore.
Take care of yourself.
Fukuda! Aoki!
Thank you for your help with hideout door.
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you.
You won't let it end like this, will you?!
How is it?
It's well done.
It does better than I thought as a shounen manga.
It's all thanks to your coaching.
I just did as you told me.
Can you write the rest?
Even though you said it was only going to be a 45 page one-shot?
Yes. I want to read the rest now.
Stick to the basics that I've taught you,
but this time, I want to you write freely.
Will something I come up with on my own be acceptable?
Of course, I'll look at it and point out the parts that need fixing.
If it's bad, I'll tell you why.
At any rate, I want to see how far you can get on your own.
I understand.
She did everything I told her.
With this, she can...
What can we fix in this storyboard?
That's what we're gonna discuss in the meeting today, right?
There's a limit to how many gags we can put in.
If it needs any changing, wouldn't it be better to change the whole plot?
Well, I think so, too...
If only eight storyboards were submitted this time, there will be a lot more next time.
And only two or three get serialized.
At least now I know that Miura's Absolutely! isn't a safe bet.
Will we really make it with him as our editor?
What are you mumbling about?
We won't make it on time if we don't leave now!
Yeah.
15:11
Aida, what do you think the best way to rework this storyboard would be?
I can't think of any way to improve it.
Then just submit it to the next committee as-is.
You're cold.
Just tell them what the committee's opinions were.
You're right.
Since Business Boy Kenichi ended, I'm not editing any serialized manga.
I have to get serialized at the next committee...
Yuujirou.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Basically, the part you did in the one-shot lost its impact in the serialization storyboard.
This will always happen, especially with gag manga.
We have to power it up!
We just need to think about how to do it!
Even if you say power it up, we've exhausted the possibilities with the characters.
A rival! There's no rival yet!
You said that if it ever became a battle manga, you'd write in an evil inventor.
Oh, that's a rival, isn't it?
Lets go with that!
Leave the first chapter as is...
and introduce the evil inventor in the second!
Oh, sorry.
This is Miura.
Takahama's come to see me.
Huh?
I believe you should also be present.
Come to the editing department.
I'm currently in a meeting with Ashirogi on the first floor,
but should I come up right now?
Bring Ashirogi, too.
Takahama?
Why did he go straight to the Chief Editor and not Miura?
Takahama has asked me to change his editor.
Why?!
Because he won't let me draw what I want.
Is that all?
Yes.
Listen.
He won't let me draw what I want...
is an admission that you don't have any talent.
If what you wanted to draw produced an excellent shounen manga,
then it would be accepted as-is.
Because it is not, it means that you do not have the ability to do so.
He won't let me draw what I want...
It does seems like an excuse.
I believe that an author who blames
the editing department or his editor for a work that doesn't produce results
is most foolish.
If you disagree with your editor and believe you are right no matter what,
then draw a shounen manga that will force him to agree.
There are works that have succeeded that way.
In a way, those works are the real thing.
Yes, sir.
I won't change your editor.
It's not because you're a newcomer.
I won't make exceptions, even for great and influential authors.
If you truly cannot get along with Miura,
then you can draw for another magazine.
I will take care of ending the contract.
I-I understand.
Sorry for being so conceited.
Takahama, if you have issues with me, please tell me directly.
I'll fix what I'm doing wrong.
Let's work together.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
The Chief Editor was scary today.
I really empathized with Takahama.
We've badmouthed Miura, too.
Let's stop putting all the blame on our editor.
Yeah. I'm regretting it now.
This is good.
I think I've heard the name Akina Aiko somewhere before...
Who is it?
She's this year's Pleiades amateur contest winner.
So why is she writing a manga manuscript?
Please keep this a secret.
She's Takagi's rival.
His rival?
Well, she may be a rival in terms of manuscript writing,
but who's doing the art?
Nakai?
No, someone who can draw it at a level that can compete with Ashirogi Muto.
Compete with Ashirogi?
Who?
Mashiro's art is really something.
Niizuma Eiji!
Niizuma?!
But... well...
19:41
And then? And then?
It was born!
It's not a chick!
Huh?
This is a great manuscript!
Are they going to fight after this?
Or...
Next! Give me the next chapter!
There isn't one yet.
There isn't?
There isn't one?
It ended at a good place, too.
Are you making this into a one-shot?
Who's drawing it?
It hasn't been decided yet.
I'm looking for any artist who can draw it well.
Can I draw it, then?
Hey!
Just wait a minute!
You can't take a break from CROW.
Neglect it in any way, and the deal's off!
I don't care about the character designs right now.
Can you make a storyboard for me?
Roger!
Hey, were you listening to me?
Spin, spin...
A circle here, a circle there...
Drawing an interesting story I could have never come up with is fun, too!
And right here, hot hot hot...
Here it is!
Scary, so scary.
It's finished.
Crap, it's too good.
I thought it would make the story better, but not by this much!
We have to do this.
Wait, but what'll happen if this is accepted?
Niizuma, I'm going to have the higher ups take a look at this.
But only on the condition that you keep doing CROW and keep the quality up.
It passes?
Can I draw it?
But if I'm going to draw it...
I'll only do it as a serialization.
Don't be ridiculous!
All right. I'm already having her write a second chapter.
I'll have her write a third and submit it to the next serialization committee.
Hattori!
Akina's been Takagi's rival since middle school.
If we do this, it'll definitely fire up Ashirogi Muto!
Yuujirou, I definitely want this to get serialized.
But two works by the same author getting serialized at the same time!?
It's fine, it just hasn't happened before.
He'll have an impossible schedule!
But you know I can make a storyboard in a day, and a manuscript in two!
Damn, he can do it if we get more assistants.
And she'll be the one writing the manuscripts, anyway.
It'll be a piece of cake!
How are we going to explain this to the higher-ups?
Niizuma, can you draw this as if you were someone else?
It's fine as long as they don't know I'm drawing it?
A new, outstanding artist has appeared. Roger!
We'll pass it out with him using a pen name, and if it passes at the committee, reveal the truth.
If it passes and we reveal that it was Niizuma, they'll have no choice but to do it.
Secret plans are fun!
Hattori, was this your aim from the beginning?
What? No, I'd never thought it'd get this far.
From the chicken comes an egg, from the egg comes a chicken!
It's getting Niizuma fired up again, and it won't interfere with CROW.
If we have authors with a strong sense of rivalry compete with each other,
it could be a good thing for Jack.
This is a good chance.
If this works, I'll get promoted to lead editor!
Maybe even put on the serialization committee...
Hattori, if this goes well, let's split the credit.
Right. Until this passes at the committee, it'll be a secret project.
I'll be the first manga author with two serializations in Jack!
SPIN!
Now, here comes my counterattack!
Sounds like a pretty scary development.
You'll regret this! I'll bring you to your knees!
Complaint and Roar.
It might be a driving force for any dream!

The fight doesn't end until I fulfill my dream
I wonder how far I've come now?
In ten years, I'll be living the dream
It's the scenario I wrote for myself, so I'll have no regrets
But life isn't that easy, and it's full of obstacles
Still, I swear to myself that I won't ever back down
I have a dream that I absolutely want to achieve
So I fuel my passion until I succeed
There will be meetings and partings along the way
But I'll simply believe in my strength that you've taught me
And rise back up again and again and again

Show me the way I'm sure our path

Show me the way I will never give up

Show me the way and see that we're certain to meet again
