The second and third Ashino Lakes,
I hope there won't be any more of those.
I received a complaint from Chairman Keel about the delay.
He came directly to me.
He was very upset. He even threatened to dismiss you.
Adam is growing well,
and work on the dummy plugs for the Eva Project is proceeding.
What are those old men of Seele complaining about now?
The all-important Instrumentality Project is behind schedule.
All the projects are linked. There are no problems.
Including Rei?
Well, never mind.
By the way, what should we do about that man?
Leave him alone for now. The same with the Marduk Institute.
I agree, let him work for us for a while.
Kyoto
What started here, sixteen years ago?
It's me.
Yes, so it is.
Shannon Bio, a foreign chemical firm.
It has been here for nine years, and not a single change.
The Marduk Institute has 108 affiliated companies.
106 of them are dummy corporations.
And this is the 107th?
This is the corporate registration.
And you want me to take a look at the board of directors, don't you?
You know about it already?
I know all of the names.
The Marduk Institute is supposed to be an advisory body
controlled by the Instrumentality Committee to select Eva pilots.
What it really does is not clear.
Your duty is to investigate NERV.
Getting involved in the Marduk Institute is inappropriate.
Well, be that as it may, I want to see everything for myself.
Hi, this is Kaji. I'm out right now.
Please leave your name and message.
Help me, Kaji! Don't touch me, you pervert!
That'll do it!
What's going on?
Well, I want to go out tomorrow.
So I've been calling Kaji to ask him to take me, but he's been out.
He's always out lately.
So, you'll have time tomorrow?
Regrettably so.
Then, I have a favor to ask of you.
Well, it's like this...
A date?!
A friend of my big sister, Kodama,
keeps asking me to introduce you to him.
I beg you!
Get to work!
I'm sorry.
YOU! Get to work!
Microsis operation complete.
Graph measurement complete.
Which dress will you wear tomorrow? Synch ratio is normal.
For the wedding?
I wore the pink suit for Kiyomi's wedding,
and the dark blue dress for Kotoko's shower.
What about the orange one?
You haven't worn that one lately, have you?
Well, there's a reason for that.
It's too tight?
Yeah, so what?!
Should I get a new one on the way home?
It's an extra expense.
We've been invited to so many showers lately,
that the cost of all the gifts is starting to add up.
Everyone's just rushing to get married before they're thirty.
No one wants to be the last one still single.
Okay, you can take off now.
Good work.
I'm tired of these stupid tests.
By the way, Shinji looks even more downcast than usual today.
That's because of tomorrow.
Yes, tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I have to see my father.
What should I talk to him about?
Why do you ask me?
Because I've seen you talking happily with him.
Say, my father, what kind of person is he?
I don't know.
I see.
You've been watching me because you wanted to ask me that?
When we were cleaning today,
you were squeezing the cloth.
The way you squeezed it was like a mother.
A mother?
I thought it was like a mother.
I think you'll make a good mother, Ayanami.
You're embarrassing me.
You're the one who caused us to break up!
I'm home. You're the one who caused us to break up!
What's up?
What's up? I was wrong. I must've been crazy.
You'd better go to bed. Aren't you going on a date tomorrow? I was wrong. I must've been crazy.
You'd better go to bed. Aren't you going on a date tomorrow? I don't care how you were!
Yeah, with a hunk. I don't care how you were!
I don't care how you were!
I'm different now anyway!
Hey, that's right, let me use your lavender perfume! I'm different now anyway!
Hey, that's right, let me use your lavender perfume! But I still love you!
Absolutely not. But I still love you!
Jeez, cheapskate! But I still love you!
Jeez, cheapskate! You can't turn back the clock!
It's not for kids. You can't turn back the clock!
Is Shinji in his room? You can't turn back the clock!
Is Shinji in his room? We can't go back to that time!
He's been shut up since he got back. We can't go back to that time!
He's been shut up since he got back. But I still love you!
It looks like he doesn't want to see his father. But I still love you!
It looks like he doesn't want to see his father. I tell you, it's impossible!
If he doesn't want to, why doesn't he just say so? I tell you, it's impossible!
I don't understand the Japanese. I tell you, it's impossible!
I don't understand the Japanese. It took me three years to forget you!
Well, he doesn't really hate him. It took me three years to forget you!
It took me three years to forget you!
That's the problem. It took me three years to forget you!
That's the problem.
Go away!
Well done, Shinji.
Shinji?
I'm opening the door.
Are you scared? Of seeing your father by yourself?
Don't run away.
Unless you step forward, nothing will change.
I know that!
You'll begin to realize,
after that first step, it's just as important to take another step.
Anyway, go see him tomorrow with your chin held high,
because you'll be seeing your mother too.
Well, good night.
Hey, you bought a new dress for tomorrow, didn't you? Let me see!
Oh, you want to see? It's an expensive one.
The price doesn't always reflect the design.
Tell me about it.
Did you pick one to Kaji's taste?
I don't think so. Not anymore.
The next day.
Well!
See you...
Later.
Place three bags in your heart...
Ladybugs with red, blue and yellow dresses...
Now let us proceed with the reception.
Ryoji Kaji
Little Ryoji's late.
That idiot has never been on time in his entire life!
For your dates, you mean? He's always on time for work.
Hey, girls! You look marvelous today.
I couldn't get off work.
I don't believe that. You never do anything anyway.
Why didn't you shave? That stubble's awful.
Look, your necktie is crooked.
Well, thank you.
You two act like you're married.
Good point, Ri-chan.
Who the hell would marry this dork?
It's been three years since the last time we came here together.
I ran away then,
and haven't been back since.
My mother is resting here?
I don't really believe that.
I don't even remember her face.
Man survives by forgetting his memories,
but there are some things a man should never forget.
Yui taught me about the irreplaceable things.
I come here to confirm that.
You have no pictures of her?
There are none.
This grave is just a decoration, too. There's no corpse.
So, the teacher was right. You threw them away.
I keep everything in my heart. That is enough.
Time's up. I'm leaving now.
Father!
Well, I'm glad we could talk today.
Indeed...
Neon Genesis Evangelion
Not bad! I didn't know you played.
I've been studying since I was five, but I'm not very good.
I don't really have any talent.
Perseverance is power. I'm impressed.
I started studying because my teacher told me to,
but I could have quit anytime.
So, why didn't you?
Because nobody told me to stop.
I should have known!
You came back early. I thought you'd have dinner too.
He was just so boring!
So, while he was waiting in line for the roller coaster, I left.
That's harsh.
Really, Kaji is the only cool guy.
It's getting late.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Are you going to leave me alone?
High heels...
We haven't really gotten together to drink lately, have we?
Misato's drinking too much, isn't she?
She's acting a little out of control.
Sometimes one drinks to keep oneself under control.
We all do.
As someone who lived with her, your words carry a weight of truth.
Well, I did live with her,
but that was before she started wearing heels like a real woman.
That's not how we saw it back when we were in school.
I was a kid.
That wasn't really life. Kid's play is what it was.
Life isn't that easy.
Oh yeah, I forgot to give you this. A souvenir from a cat.
Oh, thank you. You're very honest.
Only with the ladies. When it comes to work, I'm less so.
I somehow doubt that.
What about Misato?
I lost once before.
It's not my style to keep fighting a battle I'm sure to lose.
I think you still have a chance to win.
What about you?
It's my policy to never talk about myself.
There's nothing amusing about me.
Why is Katsuragi taking so long? Fixing her make-up maybe?
What were you doing in Kyoto?
No, that's from Matsushiro.
Don't try to fool me.
Your fingers will get burned if you get involved in this too deeply.
That's the advice of a friend.
I'll take it seriously,
but I'd prefer to be burned by the heat of my passion for you.
Should I buy you some fireworks? But I'd prefer to be burned by the heat of my passion for you.
Should I buy you some fireworks?
You never change, do you?
Of course I change, living means changing.
Homeostasis and transistasis.
What are those?
One is a force for the status quo, and the other's a force for change.
Anything that contains these two conflicting forces is alive.
Like men and women.
Well, I'll be leaving now. I've still got some work to do.
Really?
Sorry to hear it.
Later.
Hey, Shinji? It's me.
I'm with Kaji. We're going to be out drinking.
Yes... Okay, later.
Was it Misato?
Yes, she'll be late, so don't wait up for her.
Is she going to stay out until morning?
I don't think so, she's with Kaji.
Are you an idiot? That guarantees it!
Drinking so much you throw up like a kid. How old are you?
I know, but I'm not a kid.
Well, neither of us are.
Damn right.
I can't believe you wear high heels, Katsuragi.
Time's really flown.
Rough face... You need to shave.
I can walk now. Thank you.
Kaji, do you think I've changed?
You're even more beautiful.
I'm sorry that I insisted on breaking up with you.
When I said I had somebody else,
you knew that was a lie, didn't you?
No.
It's just that I realized
you were so much like my late father, Kaji.
When I realized that I wanted a man
like my father, I was scared.
I was so afraid.
Being with you, Kaji...
Being a woman...
Everything scared me.
I hated my father, but fell in love with someone just like him.
I chose to break everything off and join NERV.
However, it turned out that my father had worked for NERV too.
I tried to bury my feelings
by swearing vengeance against the Angels.
That was your decision, Katsuragi.
You don't have to be sorry.
No, that wasn't a decision!
I just escaped from reality.
Escaped from the reality called Father!
I'm just like Shinji.
I'm a coward.
I'm really sorry. I had to get drunk just to tell you this.
That's enough.
I'm just a child myself. That's enough.
I'm just a child myself.
I have no right to tell Shinji anything.
That's enough!
I'm a coward! I just use men when I need to. That's enough!
I'm a coward! I just use men when I need to.
In the past, Kaji, I may have just... just used you!
I'm so pathetic!
I'm so pathetic! That's enough! Stop it!
That's enough! Stop it!
I can't stand myself! That's enough! Stop it!
I can't stand myself!
Hey, Shinji, do you want to kiss me?
What?
A kiss. A kiss? You've never kissed a girl, have you? What?
A kiss. A kiss? You've never kissed a girl, have you?
Then, let's do it.
But why?
But why? Because I'm bored.
Because I'm bored.
Is that a reason?!
Do you not want to kiss on the anniversary of your mom's death?
Afraid she may be watching you from Heaven?
It's not that.
Are you scared? It's not that.
Are you scared?
Why would I be scared of a kiss?!
You brushed your teeth, didn't you?
Then, here I come.
Stop breathing, it tickles me.
I should never kiss to kill time!
All right, here we are. Hang on.
Kaji!
Kaji!
Well, I'll be leaving now.
Why don't you stay with us, Kaji?
I'd be laughed at if I went to work in this.
It'll be okay.
Hey, Kaji, it'll...
Later.
Lavender perfume...
Please take care of Katsuragi.
Sure.
Sure. Well, night.
Well, night.
Goodnight. Well, night.
Goodnight.
What's wrong? You look sad.
It's because you kissed me!
The next day
Well, let me call the girl's roll. Ayanami...
Oh, Ayanami's absent again?
NERV Headquarter Underground Central Section
Central Dogma
2008 meters below the surface Terminal Dogma
Hi, how are you feeling today?
I'm sober now, thanks.
I'm glad to hear that.
Is this your real job, or your other job?
What do you think?
Ryoji Kaji of NERV's Special Inspection Department...
At the same time, Ryoji Kaji of the Japanese Department of Interior.
Oh, so you know.
You underestimate NERV.
Is this an order from Commander Ikari?
No, my sole discretion.
If you keep doing this other job, you'll die.
As long as Commander Ikari is using me too, I can still do it.
However, let me apologize for using you, Major Katsuragi.
It'll make us even for your help yesterday.
Thanks very much, but...
The Commander and Ritsuko are hiding something from you, and...
This is it.
This is...
Eva? No!
Impossible...
Yes, this is the source of everything since the Second Impact.
The most important factor.
This is Adam.
Adam? Why is the First Angel here?
Adam? Why is the First Angel here?
You're right.
I don't know NERV at all.
To be continued...

Ikari Shinji finally surpasses Asuka and scores the highest in the synchro test.
However, his overconfidence draws him into Dirac's Ocean, with only little time to survive.
Next time: Deadly illness, then...
Next time, service, service.
