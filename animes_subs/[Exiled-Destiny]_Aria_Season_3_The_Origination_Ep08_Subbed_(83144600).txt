Are memories precious?
Yes! I wish I could gather every single one and keep them in a treasure box.
No sappy conversations allowed, especially in the intro!
Huh? No sappy conversations allowed, especially in the intro!
Wouldn't you want to forget all the bad things, though?
Alice?
Athena's...
Her what?
Athena's treasure box won't unlock!
Dear Ai, the weather in Neo-Venezia has been beautiful lately.
When you look up at the sunny, clear blue sky,
doesn't it sometimes make you feel like you're a fish at the bottom of the sea...
Ehh?!
You're going with Athena...
On a picnic?!...on a picnic?!
Yes, we're going tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
By any chance, is she the one who invited you?
If she did, that means... If she did, that means...
I invited Athena.
Eh? You did?
Really?
It was Athena's idea at first. She said, Once it gets warmer, let's go on a picnic, but...
But?
Spring came, but Athena's been so busy, we haven't had the chance to discuss it.
That's why...
So that's why you invited her.
What was Athena's response?
Eh? Yes, well...
It just so happens that Athena has a rare day off tomorrow, so...
Well, I guess picnics are nice once in a while.
I hope you two have a fun picnic, Alice.
Me too.
Do you remember that day Oboeteimasuka ano hi o
When your heart suddenly began to race Futo kanjita tokimeki o
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you... Aoi hizashi abite
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met Mitoreru to me ga atte
I couldn't help but smile Egao koboreta
It's just like a spiral Marude supiraare
I want to spend my days waving to you Itsumademo te o furitai hibi
This is my proof that I was here with you Koko ni tashika ni kimi to ita akashi
An eternal spiral Zutto supiraare
There's a path which stretches on ahead Kono saki mo tsuzuiteru michi ga aru
When you climb the next hill, Tsugi no saka o nobottara
Let's meet again Mata aimashou
The Memories of That Precious Person...
We'll leave early tomorrow morning.
First, we'll head towards the Canal Grande.
If we turn around at this point in the canal,
the morning sun should be sweeping over Neo-Venezia. It's supposed to be really beautiful.
After that, we'll head to Murano Island and have lunch.
Athena's late, isn't she?
I know! I'll draw up a schedule for tomorrow.
That way Athena will understand right away.
Yes, yes.
I'll bring two bananas tomorrow, one for dessert and one for snack time.
It gets really chilly after dark, doesn't it?
President Maa, it's still a little early, but let's go take a bath and warm ourselves up!
But before that...
To Athena.
Okay, let's go, President Maa.
Oh, that's right. We need to go to the cafeteria later...
Let's bring lots of different teas, too.
How about a tea-naming quiz?
Why don't we ask the cafeteria lady if she can recommend some rare teas?
It's great, isn't it? They gave us so many bananas.
Ah, looks like Athena is back.
Athena, you need to close the door properly, or...
She's asleep.
I guess we just missed each other in the bath.
Athena. Athena!
I guess she's exhausted.
Dear Athena
She must have had a last-minute booking...
President Maa, leave the lunch alone until we get to Murano Island!
Okay! This is now Murano Island!
We have sandwiches for lunch.
Eh? You're already full?
That's no good. This lunch is for two people...
Alice!
Umm... I finished... work, so...
Um, today... I suddenly got...
I know.
Um, it wasn't something I could...
It's fine.
Um, Alice, why don't we go right now?
We can't go very far, but-
I said it's fine, didn't I?! We can't go very far, but-
I said it's fine, didn't I?!
Um, I... I'm sorry!
Why are you apologizing?
Alice!
Why am I being so harsh to her?
It's not her fault...
Umm...
President Aria's favorite mug!
My, my!
Oh no! The phone's ringing!
Akari, I'll clean this up, so could you get it please?
Yes!
Coming!
Hello, this is the Aria Company.
Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th...
Th?
This is a really big SOS, Akari!
What's the matter, Alice?
We were worried.
You sounded so panicked over the phone...
Here.
Thank you.
And one for you, too.
Athena's unusually quick and responsive today, isn't she?
Now that you mention it...
On top of that, she said we must be her friends.
To tell you the truth...
Athena...
Athena!
Please snap out of it!
Athena! Athena! Athena! Athena!
Athena-
Thank goodness! You woke up...
You are?
Eh? Umm...
Who might you be?
And that's what happened.
And that's what happened!
We also have black tea, if you'd like.
No, thank you. I'm fine for now.
I see. Please tell me when you'd like some more.
Looks like her memory loss altered her personality as well.
My, my.
I'm at a complete loss about what to do...
I'm so sorry! I know it's really sudden.
It's all right. After all, it's for Athena's sake.
Has she seen a doctor?
Eh?
Ah, right, first stop should be the hospital, shouldn't it?
Yes! I think...
President Aria.
If you don't lose some weight, you'll get diabetes someday.
Athena, his name!
You remember President Aria's name?
Yes.
It just happened to come out naturally.
Maybe now she'll remember...
Ah, y-you're right.
Athena.
Yes?
What's my name?
Who are you?
What's her name?
Who is she?
Who is that?
I knew it! It's really no use!
It's no use, it's no use!
A-A-Alice, calm down! It's no use, it's no use!
A-A-Alice, calm down!
Athena.
Eh?
What is it, Alicia?
She remembered again!
She recognizes Alicia!
What kind of magic did you use?
Wow...
My, my. Did it seem like magic?
It's nothing to worry about. I'm sure it's just a temporary memory mix-up.
In the meantime, why don't you stay with her today and see if she gets any better?
If she doesn't, we'll take her to the hospital tomorrow.
How does that sound?
Y-Yes, we'll do that.
Well then, I'm off to work.
Have a good day!
Thank you very much, Alicia.
Somehow, I feel much better now.
Yeah.
Hey, why don't we take her to places she knows?
You're right.
Instead of staying in this room, Athena might recover faster elsewhere.
I'll keep you two company!
I'm sure she'll remember lots of things if we go to places she's used to.
What is it?
Now that I've calmed down, I just had a scary thought.
Right now, Athena is quick, responsive, and isn't clumsy at all.
Maybe it's actually okay if her memory doesn't come back...
You know that's not right...
The shop we're headed to now serves lots of different hot chocolates.
Really? I'm looking forward to it!
On top of that, Athena is a regular, so they have a special menu just for her.
Athena, have you remembered anything?
No...
Yes. We'll also have this, this... and this please.
They all look so delicious!
That's really correct!
Ah, it is?
That's amazing, Athena!
Thank you.
President Maa, say pretty please.
Athena!
You recognize President Maa!
Do you remember me?
Now, now. Easy now, easy...
That was delicious!
Where shall we go next?
This isn't working!
We're going back to Orange Planet!
Huh?
Is our walk over already?
I'm going to try and jog her memory in a more familiar setting.
My, Athena!
You finally have a day off, and you're not going out?
Please have your friend make herself at home!
Who was that person just now? Please have your friend make herself at home!
Please have your friend make herself at home!
Athena, just concentrate on one thing at a time.
Out of all of these...
Athena, which one is your favorite oar that you always use?
Wow, this is really hard!
Th-That's correct...
That's amazing!
You're recovering slowly but surely, Athena!
Thank you, Akari.
Amazing! You remembered my name!
Umm...
I'm sorry.
Ah, I know! How about this?
I'm sure Alicia will be back soon, so why don't we all go to the Aria Company?
I'm sorry for asking you to carry President Aria, Athena.
It's all right. I like the way President Aria feels.
What's the matter? Are you all right, Alice?
I'm the only one Athena doesn't remember...
Athena?
What kind of person was I to you?
You were a very clumsy mentor...
As your roommate, you always used to trouble me with your constant mistakes...
I guess you hated me, huh?
Ah! I didn't hate you...
Then, did you like me?
If I had to choose one or the other, I guess it'd be the latter...
Alice...
Don't you think that's enough, Athena?
Alicia!
Right, Athena?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Alice.
I was lying.
Huh?
My amnesia was all a lie.
Huh?
Wha?
What?! What?!
I'm always causing you trouble because I'm so clumsy, right?
Yes.
After what happened this morning, I thought you might have finally gotten fed up with me.
I became really worried...
So I wanted to know how you truly felt...
That's why...
That's why I thought, if I got amnesia,
I'd be able to ask how you felt about me and get an honest answer...
I'm really sorry.
Athena...
Yes?
Next time, please don't be so sneaky about it. Just be direct.
Okay.
Athena, I...
Ehh?!
My, my. Ehh?!
First of all, if you can be graceful like that, then be that way all the time!
But it's really exhausting to act like that...
Alicia, by any chance...
It's only because I've seen Athena pull some unbelievable stunts from time to time.
Were you surprised?
Yes, I was really surprised.
It never occurred to me that someone like Athena, one the Three Great Water Fairies,
would worry about things like that...
We're just like any other girls, after all.
We all wonder how the people we hold dear feel about us...
Especially if it's our cute apprentices.
Let's go home.
Okay...
C'mon Athena. Okay...
C'mon Athena. Then, do you get worried about me too, Alicia?
Wait, Alice! Then, do you get worried about me too, Alicia?
Then, do you get worried about me too, Alicia?
That's a secret.
Huh? That's a secret.
Huh?
Ai, when you like someone, that feeling might bring an equal amount of worry, too.
Akari, I'm sure that after this incident, Alice and Athena will become even closer.
A shore awash in golden waves Kin no nami kishibe ni
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning Akogare mezameru no asa ni
As my thoughts focus intently on someone, Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki
Love rests on my palm, held high Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru
A future guided by the flow of water and wind Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima
A shore awash in golden waves Kin no nami kishibe ni
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning Akogare mezameru no asa ni
And my day begins Hajimaru
