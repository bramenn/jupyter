That reporter from the Weekly Sorcerer was pretty amazing.
He completely ignored you, Lucy.
Don't laugh!
But the guild has finally calmed down.
You think?
Seems the same way to me.
And Lucy ain't got a boyfriend as usual, too.
Why are you talking about that again?!
Today, as happens only occasionally, it is raining in Magnolia.
And in a certain out of the way corner of the city,
there is a suspicious-looking magic shop.
Drip, drip, drop...
So you want to get him to notice you, eh?
Well, I have the perfect thing for that.
All Juvia wants is for him to gaze in her direction.
Drip, drip, drop.
Well, it's not beyond the ability of my potions.
Here. Try using this.
And this is?
It's a potion that will get him to gaze at you passionately.
60,000 jewel.
That is quite expensive.
If you try and haggle, then no sale.
It is 100 effective, after all.
100... Passionate gaze...
I will pay it.
Drip, drip, drop.
This mysterious potion that Juvia bought at full price
could well bring Fairy Tail to the brink of destruction.
But no one is yet aware of the danger.
Special Request: Watch Out for the Guy You Like!
Nothing to do!
Why don't you go on a job?
Well, Natsu said he wanted to rest for a little while.
Couldn't you go by yourself, or with some other people?
But I have a responsibility to him since we're on the same team.
You guys really get along well.
Like you're a couple!
We are not!
But Natsu might really love you, Lucy.
Even if that's the case, I think I'll pass.
I think you two would be a good match, though.
Hey, Natsu! We'd better go on a job soon, or else...
You, put on some clothes!
Did you use too much fire and turn your brain to charcoal, Natsu?
Hey, give it a rest! You gotta take a day off once in a while, right?
Isn't that right, Happy?
Aye!
Refresh!
And to refresh, you do this!
Yeah, I don't think so.
I think you two would be a good match, though.
Gray-sama...
May your passionate gaze only be aimed at Juvia!
Ah, this is so nerve-wracking!
Even Juvia's hands are shaking!
No!
I think you two would make a good couple, though.
Not a chance.
Sheesh, Mira-san. Don't even joke about that.
That's dangerous, Lucy-chan!
I'm home!
Yo!
Letting yourself in again?!
Actually, I have something important to ask you.
Man, you really love my house, you know that?
Love
Love!!?
Love.
Natsu might really love you, Lucy.
Go home!
But it's important.
Talk about something important
Important?
Go home!
What's with you?
Somebody's in a lousy mood today!
Leave using the door!
Crap... What's going on here?
The next day.
Nothing to do...
Hey there!
You feelin' better?
Get off! Stop being all over me like that!
Hey, Lucy...
This is bad. This is real bad.
I'm being totally self conscious...
Natsu!
That's about enough!
How long are you planning on playing around?
What's that?
You wanna go, buddy?
Fight!
Gray-sama...
Yesterday, Juvia was too nervous, she couldn't...
But today, Juvia has made up her mind!
What type of potion is this?
Blow on the contents of the flask,
and have the person you are interested in swallow just a little.
If you do, your passionate feelings will reach them, perhaps. That's how it works.
Gray-sama...
This passion burning within, growing stronger and stronger as long as you are out of reach...
Love!
The closer Juvia gets, the more impatient she feels!
But today, that will all be over.
Starting today, Juvia and Gray-sama will be together as one, as lovers!
Oh, my!
Oh, right! I don't have time for this!
What's that supposed to mean?
It seems like Natsu has some girl he's in love with.
You mean our Natsu?
No way.
What a laugh.
That's the last thing I'd expect to hear about him.
It's the truth!
Lately he's been all I want to see her, I want to see her!
See who?
I don't know.
What'll I do? What'll I do?
It's me!
It's not like I hate him or anything...
When it comes to love or dating, well, it's just...
I've never gone out with a guy before!
I want to see you.
Stop prettifying him, Lucy!
Stop getting wild ideas, Lucy!
Hey, Lucy...
Yes?
Tonight, I have something important to talk with you about.
Would you come by the Sola tree in the South Gate Park tonight?
Why?
I have something important to talk about.
Make sure you come alone.
He's blushing?
Blushing?
Natsu blushed!
Later!
Mira-san...
I'm going home for the day.
Natsu! Where the hell do you think you're going?
Now, Gray-sama... Your passionate gaze!
That bastard... Wait, Natsu!
Look at Juvia!
Stop moving, Gray-sama!
At this rate, everyone is going to be looking at Juvia passionately!
No one needs that!
Gray-sama!
I did it!
What is this feeling?
Finally... Finally...
Ah! Gray-sama's...
You're always...
You're always flying as you damn well please in the sky!
What?
I'm strong, but I can't fly!
You're weak, but you can fly!
So in the end, we're even!
Happy!
You are my rival!
What are you talking about, Gray?
I challenge you, Happy!
Natsu, I'm scared! Gray's acting all freaky!
Where's Natsu?
N-No... Where's the passionate gaze?
Wakaba, how much you make last month?
A lot more than you, I bet!
There's no way I could lose to you!
You, especially, I won't lose to!
What are we to each other, again?
Rivals, of course! That's how it should be!
Drink alcohol, but don't be drowned by it!
You listening, alcohol?
I ain't gonna lose to the likes of you!
It is you that is my fated rival!
What do you mean, your rival is alcohol, Master?
Alcohol isn't a person. It can't be your rival.
I won't be drowned! I won't be drowned in you!
We battle!
You, pillar over there!
Why must you always obstruct my path?
All I ever wished for was to pass through here, unhindered,
and yet, why?!
Why must you challenge me so?
Do you intend to make me your rival?
Uh, being rivals with a pillar is...
That's just not happening.
Alcohol is one thing, but a pillar is right out there.
Well, maybe if it pilloried her...
I'll just let that sit there.
Erza! Let's fight like we used to back in the day!
I'm not gonna lose, no way!
Because you are my lifelong rival, Erza!
Hey, what's going on?
Where are you, Natsu?
I challenge you, Happy!
Now look here.
I am going to fly farther than you, without fail!
It's impossible, I say!
No! I will fly!
Against you... Against my rival...
I will not lose, no matter what!
Where'd you go, Natsu?!
Could it be that it takes some time before the potion takes effect?
I think an explanation is in order.
That's something I mixed up with a bunch of forbidden magical ingredients.
Who knows what effect it might have?
And why would I do such a thing?
Because I needed some cash to make a getaway!
And there you have it.
What will become of Fairy Tail?
What'll I do? What'll I do?
Would you come by the Sola tree in the South Gate Park tonight?
I have something important to talk about.
Make sure you come alone.
What'll I do? What'll I do?
This has got to be a love confession! Definitely!
I have to turn him down...
After all, we're on the same team...
I'm sorry, Natsu...
This is the perfect chance to wear that!
Yup, this will work great!
Wait. This is all wrong!
Idiot! What the heck are you thinking, Lucy?!
I mean, what'll I do? What'll I do?
Oh, I know!
Gate of the Giant Crab, I open thee! Cancer!
Cancer.
Make me look cute,'kay?
As you wish-ebi.
What the hell are you doing, Lucy?
And yet, I ended up doing it myself!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon...
Let's have 30 babies together, Lucy.
Sure!
I'm all fired up.
I'm saying that's not how it is!
And why were they Happys?
Master!
Let's have a drinking contest!
I always wanted to challenge you!
You are not my rival!
My rival is alcohol itself!
I won't lose!
Three against three.
Don't go thinking that just because we're equal in number, we're equal in ability.
When you talk about teams of three in Fairy Tail, it always means us!
Let's battle!
Is there no real Man here?
If there's a rival for me, show yourself!
I am saddened! I am violently saddened!
Ah, so he thinks he has no rival.
Where does he get that self-confidence from?
You finished adding it up, rival?
Of course! And faster than you, rival!
Getting a little dull in the tooth, I see.
D-Damn you! I'm...
On the count of three.
Bring it on!
The amount of money I made last month is...
One, two...
150,000 jewel all in all!
The same?
Then we'll do battle with the month before last!
We Raijin Tribe versus you Shadow Gear!
We'll decide just who is the best three-person team in Fairy Tail!
Don't be surprised when you see our skills!
Damn you...
They're having a posing competition?
Not yet!
Not yet!
Where is a Man?
Lucy-chan, that's dangerous!
I'll be fine!
Well, aren't you lookin' good today!
Don't go fallin' in the river before your date!
D-Date?
Good. At least I look cute.
I mean, this is all wrong!
All wrong! All wrong!
This is not gonna work! We're co-workers!
I'll be together with Natsu for...
We'll be together forever, Lucy.
Together forever?
Requip!
Heaven's Wheel Armor!
Erza, stop this!
We just rebuilt the place! Don't go destroying it!
Silence!
This guy is constantly standing up in my way!
It especially makes me angry when I wish to go further inside without delay!
It's impossible to go further in without going around it!
It is this pillar that is always standing in my way,
in other words, my rival!
Yeah, but you just have to go around it a little...
I know you like to take things straight on, but sheesh...
Erza tends not to look where she's going.
That's not true.
Erza, fight me!
Your rival is right here!
I'm facing down my lifelong rival right now!
Uh, it's just a pillar.
I can't believe this!
Satan Soul!
Stop it, already!
Requip! Purgatory Armor!
Listen, just stop, already!
Wildcat... Punch!
Where's a real Man?
Punch!
It's no use.
The guild's gonna be destroyed again...
And?
Gray, it's impossible, I tell you! Stop this!
That's no good!
I am going to surpass you, my rival!
Juvia is so vexed!
More potion...
Come, my rival! Follow me!
Gray!
I'm even more fired up!
He's all like Natsu!
I will fly!
I will fly!
Fly, me!
The Sola tree in South Gate Park.
Keep it together...
Keep it together... Stay calm, Lucy!
Hey, Lucy!
What'll I do? What'll I do?
I'm a pushover when it comes to pushy people!
You're late! Out with that maid of yours already.
What was her name again?
You know... Right, Virgo.
The ground's really hard here.
I'll never be able to dig it up without that Spirit maid of yours.
Uh, um...
And the important thing you wanted to talk about?
I hear there's a treasure buried here!
It's supposed to be an album of embarrassing pictures of everyone in Fairy Tail!
Gramps hid it here a long time ago, I heard!
Isn't this gonna be fun?
And...the girl you fell in love with recently?
What? Huh?
You were saying I want to see her, I want to see her.
Oh.
It's not like I care one way or the other, but it was Virgo.
I was hoping she'd dig the hole for me!
The hole?
The hole?
The hole?!
I am such a total fool!
And, just like the previous episode, Lucy is disappointed in the end.
What in the world happened?
Thank goodness...
Gray, hang in there! It's morning already, Gray!
Juvia! You came to save him, right?
Gray-sama...
So sorry!
To make you go through all that...
The reason the potion didn't work correctly is surely
because Juvia's feelings for you weren't strong enough!
Gray-sama!
Juvia? What happened to me?
You're safe... Thank goodness.
She lllikes you!
I knew I was cold for some reason.
Stop gettin' me all soaked.
How many times do I have to tell you?
No! Juvia is shocked!
Huh? What is it?
It isn't enough, it just isn't!
And that's why Juvia...
is breakin' out the potion!
Juvia is over here!
You! Horizon over there!
You are my rival!
Gray-sama!
Wait!
I guess some people weren't meant to fly.
And, just like Lucy, Juvia is disappointed in the end.
A few days later...
Nothing to do...
Hey, Lucy.
Yes?
I was just thinking...
Don't you think Gray loves you, Lucy?
Please, just leave me alone!
What? A spell to make feelings mutual? Doesn't exist.
Wait...
Why did I end up here?
It's the Curse of the Moon!
What? Some guys from a Dark Guild are runnin' amok?
All righty! I'll go and bust'em up!
You can't! They've got hostages.
I bet you'd beat the hostages up with them, Natsu.
Even so, I'll do it!
I said no, and that's it!
Then at least give me more screen time!
Next time: Love Lucky!
Huh? Is that why?
Well, don't you get the feeling I haven't shown up much lately?
Life ain't all roses, you know.
