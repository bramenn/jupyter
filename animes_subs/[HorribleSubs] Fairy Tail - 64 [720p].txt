We beat Brain, and there's only one of Oracion Seis left!
That is just a dream.
But we were caught by a trap, and Mr. Potato Head was...
That is also a dream.
I know the light that's inside Jellal.
And that, especially, is a dream.
You can still stand?
Just as the rumors say, Erza...
Breaking you will totally be worth the effort!
I will stop you and your idiotic goals!
Without fail.
There is no stopping us! We are near!
Caitshelter!
Come to me, Erza.
Or rather, Titania...
Now, show me your true strength.
Although your attacks still won't be able to hit me.
Yes, that's right. His magic, Reflector, can bend away any attack.
Is there a way to defeat him?
Zero!
So fast!
But...
My Reflector will not be broken, no matter how quickly you move!
See?
W-What?
There are two.
There are two weaknesses to your magic.
Two weaknesses?
In just a short time, she...
You may be able to bend magic and objects,
but you are unable to bend human bodies.
If that were not the case, it would have been faster to warp my body than my armor.
Am I right?
So, what of it?
Even if that's the case, if I'm being serious, I can finish you off with your clothes.
The second weakness: This!
Erza, what are you...
But he said that attacks won't hit him!
While you were bending my armor, you dodged my sword normally!
Why didn't you bend the path of the sword instead?
The answer: Because you can only bend things in one limited area at a time.
The area around yourself, or the area around your enemy...
You must choose one or the other.
While you are casting your magic on me, you cannot activate Reflector around yourself.
What incredible battle perception!
And this, my Robe of Remoteness,
is flexible armor!
Your magic will not work!
Oh? I guess if you include this armor, that's three weaknesses.
Damn it...
I was so close!
This fight is over.
You will surrender without trouble now, yes?
It is already midnight...
It is too late.
If you had let me finish you sooner, you could have slept peacefully...
You could have escaped facing the fear!
What's that?
A bell?
It is the bell that chimes midnight.
When it becomes midnight, my warping is taken to the extreme!
What is this?
Don't blame me for what's going to happen!
What is this magic?
It's not a Take Over... It's some magic power I've never felt before!
Jellal...
Your rule was all a lie...
There was no freedom in the Tower of Heaven.
After the uprising,
I was so scared every night I couldn't sleep!
What?
I see! You all were also... in that tower!
So that's what Cobra was saying...
This is also your sin, Titania!
You averted your eyes for eight years from the suffering of your brethren.
And now, at the end, you stand together with Jellal, who should be the root of your hatred!
For the people who lost their lives for you, it is truly a nightmare.
Don't you think?
Grampa Rob!
Simon!
They are your sins.
You are their nightmare!
You fiend!
Whoa, there... That's pretty cruel.
You laid hands on your allies.
Why, you...
What?
Yes... That's for the best.
Jellal, done in by your hands...
Villain!
Erza!
But wait! Midnight's just begun and there's still much more fun!
W-What happened?
I saw him transform into a giant...
My illusion didn't work?!
Illusion?
Did what I saw all happen while the bell was still ringing?
Sorry, but magic that affects the eyes doesn't work on me.
B-But that's...
I was the most powerful...
I had surpassed my father... I was the strongest of the Six Generals...
I couldn't lose to anyone!
The most powerful...
As long as you laugh at people's suffering, that goal will remain far out of reach.
My prayer...
I just wanted to be able to sleep...
In a quiet place...
Father...
This... is Erza.
If you never want to be defeated, you must first know your own weaknesses.
And also... always be kind.
Natsu!
Damn it!
Look at him tumble, Lucy!
Well, I don't think that's the main point here.
Caught ya!
Great going, Natsu! Now, beat the crap out of it!
Stop moving around!
Hold it down properly, you dolt!
Try dodging it instead, you jerk!
This battle isn't pretty.
Here we go again! The usual...
The usual over self-consciousness?
No!
The usual It's such trouble being so cute!
Natsu, Gray! Lucy broke!
Oh, it's just a kid. Such a disappointment...
A kid?!
Now!
You brats...
Natsu, Gray!
Oh, no! That guy's actually strong!
What's wrong? Is all you got your youth?
Youth alone isn't going to beat me!
You young'ns always showin' off your young selves, you!
I think he might be a bit self-conscious about his age...
Aye...
And what?
Right on the mark, huh?
No, I think it's something else.
Incredible...
All six... All Six Generals are wiped out!
No, this is bad! Very bad!
He is coming!
What's he saying?
He?
There's someone else?
Don't tell me the eighth?
What are you talking about?
He's juicing like crazy!
You mean sweat!
Brain...
If you're talking about him, Jura beat him.
No...
Brain has another personality.
There is the front face, codenamed Brain, who holds so much knowledge.
And then there is the back face, codenamed Zero, who loves nothing but destruction.
Loves destruction?
Zero?
Due to his overwhelming, evil magical powers,
Brain sealed that existence away himself with six keys.
And those are... Oracion Seis!
Exactly.
And when the Six Generals fall, and their Body Link magic is broken,
the personality of Zero will be reborn once again...
This sounds like fun!
Master?
Klodoa, it seems things have gotten quite interesting.
Even that Midnight was beaten?
I-I truly apologize!
Although, it sure has been a while, to have this feeling...
To have this body... This voice!
This magic!
It all brings me back...
I'll handle the rest.
Stand back, Klodoa.
You little brats...
You sure made a mess out of my guild.
As its master, I will make you pay for that.
He's... the guildmaster of Oracion Seis?
Zero!
The ground is shaking from his magic power?
Gettin' fired up, Natsu?
I've never felt magic power this nasty!
That's right...
I'll start by erasing this baldy who hurt this body's Brain!
You're gonna attack someone who can't even move?
What nonsense...
My shield is being broken, just like that?
Old dude!
Gray!
Whether he can move or not isn't much of a difference.
As long as it has form, it's just as fun to destroy!
Why, you...
Oh, no!
W-What'll we do?
My body's... frozen stiff...
I'm scared!
Impressive, Master Zero! Excellent work as always!
Defeating these annoying brats like they were nothing!
But they still live.
You're still alive, aren't you?
Stand up.
You still have form!
Does it hurt?
No, I'm fine...
I apologize.
I was in too much of a hurry to stop Nirvana.
That wound... And the fact you'd used up nearly all your magic power...
You were barely even able to stand, weren't you, Jellal?
No, it's okay. It doesn't change the fact that it was I who undid the seal on Nirvana.
We must hurry and stop it.
I wonder for how long...
How long will I be able to remain anchored at this harbor known as battle?
He's gone.
Where are you, Jellal?
Wendy, I'm at my limit. Let me rest a bit.
Sure!
I'm sorry for pushing you, Carla.
It's fine.
I remember that mountain.
We're almost there.
Sheesh. But this ancient city is huge!
What'll we do?
It's no use... No matter how much we look, we won't find him!
You getting weak-knees isn't going to help.
At this rate, Caitshelter will be...
I know that!
I know, but what should I do?
Decide on one thing!
Do you want to see Jellal?
Do you want Jellal to stop this thing?
If you chase two rabbits at once, you won't catch either!
Right. We have to stop it.
Right now, we have to stop Nirvana!
Don't think about other things, and keep searching.
Right!
We have to stop it! Right now, we have to stop it!
I can see it! I can see it! I can see it, Master Zero!
Thank you for waiting! I can see it!
There is it! I can see Caitshelter!
That's the guild of the race that has sealed Nirvana for an eternity!
All we have to do is destroy them, and then Nirvana can never be sealed again!
Alrighty then!
This is stupid.
You heard me, Klodoa.
What, Master Zero?
Destruction! All I want to do is destroy!
Anything and everything!
This will be my first shot!
There's no reason. Until it no longer has a form left to destroy!
Nirvana, fire!
Natsu, do you know about Pegasus?
Sure... It's the thing that Hibiki's guildmark is a picture of.
Aye! It's supposed to be a winged horse!
It's not just snakes, but horses with wings, too!
My character's being ripped off right and left!
Is having wings all the rage lately?
Next time: From Pegasus to the Fairies!
If wings are all the rage, then business will be booming!
Happy... Are you some kind of merchandise?
