The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds, and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
The port town, Hargeon.
Um, sir?
Natsu, we're here! Hargeon!
Get up! Get up!
Is he okay?
Aye!
He always gets like this.
I can't handle it...
I'll never take the train again...
If the info is correct, salamander should be in this town.
Let's go.
L-Let me rest for a bit...
Save me!
It departed.
Fairy Tail!
What? There's only one magic store in this entire town?
Yes. This town lives off the fishing business instead of magic.
Not even a tenth of the people in this town use magic,
so this store specializes in selling to traveling wizards.
I guess this was a total bust, then?
Now, now, don't say that. Please, have a look.
I have a lot of new merchandise, you know.
Girls just love this ColorS magic.
You can switch the color of your clothes to whatever you feel like that day!
Change! Like this!
I already have that one.
Yeah!
I'm searching for some powerful gate keys.
Gates, huh? Those are rare...
This is the white puppy, White Doggy!
That one's not powerful at all.
So what? I was looking for it...
How much?
20,000 jewel.
How much might it be again?
Like I said, 20,000 jewel.
Come on, how much is it, really, you wonderful old man you...
He only knocked off 1000 jewel?
So my looks are only worth 1000 jewel?
That's nothing! It pisses me off...
If that's about all I can realistically get, then...
You said that a famous wizard's come to town?
It's Salamander-sama!
Salamander?
The one they say can use fire magic you can't buy in a store?
He's in this town?
Damn, I ended up taking the train again.
And you're no good at riding things, Natsu.
Not to mention I'm starving...
And we don't have any money.
Say, Happy...
This salamander is Igneel, right?
Yeah! I doubt a fire dragon would be anyone but Igneel, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Salamandar-sama!
You're so wonderful!
Burn me!
Salamander!
See? Talk about somebody, and they show up!
Aye!
Lovely!
Cool!
Why is my heart beating this fast?
Hey, what's gotten into me?
Captivated, aren't you?
He looked at me!
Am I this excited because he's a famous wizard?
Could it be?
Is he the one...
Igneel!
Who the heck are you?
If I said Salamander, would that ring a bell?
He's already gone!
How rude of you!
Yeah! Salamander-sama is an amazing wizard!
Apologize to him!
What's wrong with you people?
Now, now... Just leave it at that.
It's not like he meant any harm by it.
He's so kind!
Here is my autograph. Feel free to show it off to your friends.
No thanks.
I guess we got the wrong person.
Now then, I have some business at the next port, so if you'll excuse me...
What? You're leaving already?
Red Carpet!
I'm having a party on my ship this evening! Everyone, please attend!
Of course!
Who the heck was that guy?
What a scumbag.
Thanks a lot.
Huh?
And then...
I'm Lucy. Nice to meet you!
Aye!
Natsu and Happy, was it?
You're really nice.
Thanks, sure... Just take your time and...
I'm kind of in the splash zone here...
See, that Salamander guy was using a Charm spell, a type of hypnosis spell.
That kind of magic can make people attracted to you, but its sale was banned years ago.
He'd go that far just to be popular?
What a creepy jerk.
But thanks to you barging in the Charm was lifted, so this is my way of saying thanks.
I see.
I know I don't seem like it, but I'm actually a wizard myself!
I haven't joined a guild yet, though.
Oh yeah, guilds are places where wizards gather to share information and take on jobs.
You can't be said to be a full-fledged wizard unless you've joined a guild.
But, but... There are guilds all over the world, and it's really difficult to get into the popular ones, see!
The one I want to get into, see, has like a ton of amazing wizards, and...
Oh, what am I to do? I want to join up, but I bet it's really tough...
Uh...
Oh, I'm sorry! I'm just blabbing on about the world of wizards and stuff...
This is all gibberish to you, isn't it?
But I'm totally going to join that guild.
I bet that I could get a bunch of big jobs with them.
Y-You think?
You sure talk a lot.
Oh yeah... It looked like you guys were searching for someone.
Aye! Igneel!
I'd heard that a salamander had come to this town, so it's good we checked it out.
But I guess it was someone else.
He didn't look like a salamander.
They're fire dragons, so I really thought it would be Igneel.
What kind of human looks like a fire dragon?
He's not human. Igneel's an actual dragon.
Aye!
He's a real dragon.
Even in this world of magic, dragons are extremely rare creatures that are hardly ever seen.
Something like that wouldn't be in the middle of a town!
You just realized this, now?!
Anyway, I have to get going, so take your time.
Thank you, come again.
We appreciate your kindness!
Kindness!
Stop it already! You're embarrassing me!
It's fine, okay? You saved me back there, so we're even now,'kay?
But we weren't trying to save you or anything...
Aye. No payment needed.
That's it!
You can have this!
Who'd want that?!
The magic magazine, Weekly Sorcerer.
Oh my, Fairy Tail's caused trouble again?
The Devon thieves gang wiped out along with 7 residences...
Man, they just go overboard!
Ooh, a photo spread of Mirajane!
But how exactly does one join Fairy Tail?
I wonder if they have an interview or something.
The wizard's guild, Fairy Tail...
They're just the coolest!
So you want to join Fairy Tail?
S-Salamander!
I was looking for you.
I wanted to invite you personally to the party on my ship.
Your Charm won't work on me!
That magic's weak point is awareness!
It doesn't work on people who know it's being used!
As I thought.
I realized the moment I saw you that you were a wizard.
No matter. As long as you come to the party.
There's no way I'd go!
Not to a party thrown by a scumbag like you!
I'm a scumbag?
You'd go so far as to use a Charm to be popular.
It's part of the ceremony, see.
I just wanted the party to have a celebrity as a host, see...
I can't believe a famous wizard is such an idiot.
You wanted to join Fairy Tail, yes?
Haven't you heard of Fairy Tail's Salamander?
I have!
You're one of Fairy Tail's wizards?
That's right.
If you want to join, I'll put a word in with the Guild Master.
The party sounds like it'll be wonderful, doesn't it?
You're easy to figure out, you know that?
Hey, do you really think I can get into Fairy Tail?
Of course.
But in return, keep quiet about the Charm, okay?
Sure thing!
We shall meet again at the party, then!
Yes sir!
He used a pseudo-charm.
But... All right!
I can join Fairy Tail!
Until then, I've got to play nice with that dumb oaf!
What a meal!
Aye!
Oh yeah... Is that the ship Salamander's party is at?
Gonna hurl...
Stop getting queasy just from thinking about it.
Look at that! That's Salamander-sama's ship!
I wish I had gone!
Salamander?
You don't know him?
He's the famous Fairy Tail wizard that came to town!
Fairy Tail?
Fairy Tail...
Lucy-wucy, was it?
What a pretty name.
Thanks...
Let's start off with a toast.
Now, open wide, and savor the fruit flavored gems as they enter your mouth...
I've got to deal with it!
Gotta hang in there!
What's the meaning of this?
That's magic to knock people out, Sleep.
You're pretty sharp.
Don't get any ideas.
I want to join Fairy Tail, but I have no intention of being your woman.
What a handful you are, girly!
What the heck is this?
Bosco?!
What about Fairy Tail?
Give it up! You're our merchandise now.
That's...
Then, the other girls...
That's our Salamander-san!
We've got ourselves quite a haul this time!
Why, you...
Gate Keys?
So you're a Celestial Wizard?
This magic can only be used by the contract holders.
In other words, these are useless to me.
What's the matter with this guy?
What a horrible thing to do...
So this... So this is what it means to be a Fairy Tail wizard?
Using magic for evil and tricking people...
That's the worst kind of wizard there is!
Natsu!
As I thought, it's no use...
Lame!
Lucy, what are you doing?
Happy!
I was tricked. He said he'd help me join Fairy Tail.
Wait, since when did you have wings?
Leave that for later!
Run away!
After her! It'll be trouble if the council gets wind of this!
Hey, what about Natsu?
I can't carry two people.
You think you can escape?
Prominence Whip!
Kaboom!
That cat's damn quick!
Hey...
I've got to save Natsu and the other girls!
Lucy, listen up.
What is it now?
My transformation ran out.
You damned cat!
There they are!
Ah, well... First we hurry to Bosco...
Fairy... Tail...
You?!
Here I go!
Gate of the water bearer, I open thee!
Aquarius!
A fish!
Um, no.
Wow.
I'm a celestial wizard, see.
I use gate keys to call celestial spirits from an alternate dimension.
Aquarius! Use your power and sweep that ship up onto the shore!
Tch.
Did you, perhaps, just say tch to me?!
You really shouldn't complain like that.
What an annoying girl you are.
Let me tell you something.
The next time you drop my key, I'll kill you.
S-Sorry!
Don't sweep me away, too!
What were you thinking?
You think it's normal to sweep me up, too?
Alas, I failed.
I ended up sweeping the ship as well.
You were aiming for me?!
Do not call me for a while.
I will be on vacation for a week with my boyfriend.
With my boyfriend.
Don't rub it in!
Hey, Lucy! Maybe I shouldn't have apologized back then?
This cat's so oblivious, I don't even know where to start...
What is this?
A ship was thrown into the port!
Damn it! What the...
Natsu!
You, a Fairy Tail wizard?
And what's it to you?
Get'im, boys!
Right!
Take a good look at this face.
Natsu!
Don't worry. I should have told you sooner, but Natsu is also a wizard.
I'm Natsu of Fairy Tail!
And I ain't never seen you before!
Fairy Tail?
Natsu is a Fairy Tail wizard?
That mark...
He's the real deal, Bora-san!
Idiot! Don't call me by that name!
Bora... Bora the Prominence.
He was thrown out of the Titan Nose guild some years back.
I dunno whether you're a bad guy or a good guy...
But I ain't gonna let you get away with pretending to be from Fairy Tail!
And what do you plan to do about it, boy?!
Prominence Typhoon!
Natsu!
I take no pleasure in defeating big-mouths like you.
Gross!
Are you really a fire wizard?
I can't believe how gross this fire tastes!
Thanks for the meal.
W-W-W-W-What the heck is he?
Fire isn't going to work on Natsu.
I've never seen magic like that.
Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up.
Here I go!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
B-Bora-san...
I've seen that guy before.
With the pink hair, and the scarf that looks like scales...
It's got to be him!
He's the real...
Salamander!
Remember it well...
This is what a real Fairy Tail wizard is!
Red Shower!
He eats fire, and punches with fire?
Is that really magic?
A dragon's lungs to breath flames...
A dragon's scales to dissolve flames...
A dragon's claws to wrap in flames...
It's magic that transforms your own body parts into those of a dragon's.
An ancient spell.
What's that?
It was originally magic used to deal with dragons.
My...
Hell Prominence!
Dragon Slayer magic.
Igneel taught it to Natsu.
Damn you!
I'm getting a pretty good meal here!
Listen up, jerk.
I'm gonna smoke you to a smoldering crisp!
Smoke me?
Take this!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
Natsu... You don't smoke things using flames...
Wow...
Just, wow... But...
Isn't this going a bit overboard?
Aye!
Aye nothing!
The military?
Crap, let's get outta here!
Why are you taking me with you?
Well, you wanted to join our guild, right?
Come with me!
Sure!
To enter a guild, you've first got to take an interview.
First impressions are crucial, after all.
Greetings, my name is Lucy.
Hmm, maybe that's too stiff.
Hiyas! I'm Lucy!
That's way too friendly...
Next time: Fire Dragon, Monkey, and Bull!
I've got to seem more excited and make a big impression!
I AM LUCY!
