Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Happy, where are you?
Happy!
They left me behind!
I have to head to where Natsu is while I have the chance!
It'll be all right! I'll yell it out countless times.
I believe your every tomorrow will be shining.
The intersection of all people
Never giving up. And that's why we're not gonna lose!
When it seems like you'll be blown away by the headwinds,
grasp this hand, try to take a chance.
Because you're not alone anymore, got it?
Go forward, more and more!
Don't give up on your awesome dream!
That's right, don't cry!
Move on, my way!
Now, with the light shining down upon you.
Don't even think about something like giving up!
Even if you trade being hurt again for strength.
Your eyes, always looking straight ahead,
can surely see the light!
I'm not gonna be won over by this kiddy kitty merchandise, you know!
Wait for me!
Voice of Darkness!
We rose up for our freedom, and to save Jellal.
Don't underestimate Mad Dog Wally!
We're tough thanks to all that training you gave us!
D-Damn it!
This guy isn't sayin' a peep! What a bore...
You keep puttin' up a brave face, and you'll end up like that girl from before.
Hey, brat!
Do you realize how sacred a cause it is to erect this R-system?
At the moment this tower is completed, all of you will get to go to heaven!
The R-system will resurrect our god!
Shut up, pig...
What did you say?
Let him be.
We're gonna have to help suppress the rebellion this afternoon.
We'll continue the ceremony as many times as it takes until you learn to revere our god!
God?
I don't need anything like that.
I don't need a god that can't even save one child.
Hatred...
Hate...
I hate everything...
I hate them, and their god...
Everything about this world...
Hate! And I will devour that hatred...
People's hatred makes me grow stronger.
Who are you?
What amusing fools.
I'm right here among them...
Yet they trouble themselves to resurrect me?
To give me a body?
Where are you?
No matter how fiercely they believe,
one cannot sense my presence without strong hatred.
Jellal...
You are quite the lucky one!
You got to meet the god that they worship so!
My name is Zeref!
My existence is hatred itself...
We need to liberate Sector 8 today!
Everyone, keep it up!
Impossible! The guard is too tight there!
But we have to hurry and save Jellal or...
You ain't got a prayer, Mr. Simo.
Erza! A-Are you in love with Jellal?
Why are you bringing that up now?
Now is not the time to...
I've always...
Simon!
That's...
Magic Troops!
Simon!
Hey, wake up!
Don't!
Everyone, don't give up!
You've got to fight!
Outta the way!
Wait...
Save... Jellal...
Sis!
Erza!
Grandpa Rob!
My magical power may have withered, but I can still protect my friends!
I will not allow such young life to perish!
Whoa!
He reflected the magic back!
What's the matter?
Perhaps I have been of some use, despite me being such a decrepit old man...
For a wizard, one's magical power is the same as their life energy itself.
And when this old man lost his magic, I was brought to this sorry state...
But, Erza, your possibilities are still endless!
Grandpa...
It's your heart.
Heart?
Right. Everything begins from believing from your heart.
For example, you can think of horoscopes, faith, and prayer as forms of magic.
They are miracles that only people who believe can sense.
Only those who believe?
That's right.
Only those who believe in the power of magic, believe their your own power,
and believe in living in harmony with nature are able to use magic.
Magic, huh?
How amazing!
When I grow up, I want to become a witch and ride on a broom and fly in the sky!
I think you'll be able to.
You'll fly free, in the wide open sky...
And I'll let you ride too, Grandpa!
I didn't think I'd see a smile like that in a place like this.
Grandpa!
Freedom is inside of your heart.
There is no freedom in this world.
I am sure that your dream will come true, Erza...
I will grant your wish!
Grandpa!
No!
Freedom is here.
Erza, retreat! Hurry!
Sis!
Er-chan!
Amazing...
Just like that...
Even the Magic Troops...
Sis can use magic?
This is... magic...
I can do this.
With this power, I can save Jellal!
Flying in the sky will have to wait for now, Grandpa.
Follow me!
Hey, what are we going to do?
Let's escape!
W-Wait!
We were just acting under orders!
Out of my way!
Jellal!
It's all right now!
It's all over!
We fought, just like you said to, Jellal!
Simon's seriously injured, and Grandpa Rob shielded me...
There are a great number of other people who sacrificed their lives.
But we won!
We've gained our freedom!
Let's go!
Wally and the others have taken their boats.
We can get off this island!
Erza...
There's no more running away.
True freedom is right here.
Ooh, it's a movie lacrima!
What's that?
It's a lacrima that stores the data of a movie.
What's a moovee?
A story!
Actors act out a drama for us to watch!
Well, it's the first time I ever saw one myself though...
Too bad for you, Tony Joe.
From the moment you met me...
How austere!
He's kinda hard-edged...
That's how a dandy should be!
I don't get it at all.
Sis is late...
Jella, what are you talking about?
Let's escape from this island together!
Erza, there is no freedom in this world.
I realized that.
It is not transient freedom that we require.
It's true freedom.
Zeref's world!
I can understand their feelings a bit now.
They were trying to resurrect this Zeref person, see.
But these pitiful believers couldn't even sense Zeref's presence.
Isn't that right?
This tower is mine.
I will complete it.
I will resurrect Zeref.
Magic?
Save me!
Stop it, Jellal!
Stop?
Don't you hate them, Erza?
I hate them, but this is...
That's no good!
You won't be able to sense Zeref like that!
Stop!
Jellal!
What's happened?
Nothing.
Erza, let's complete the R-system... I mean, the Tower of Heaven, together!
Then we can resurrect Zeref.
Stop saying such crazy things!
We're going to get off this island!
Fine. If you want to go so badly, then you can leave this island on your own.
On my own?
The rest of them are all mine.
Completing this tower will take a lot of work, after all.
You don't have to worry.
I'm not like them.
I'll give everyone clothes, and food, and rest.
Fear and oppression does give rise to hatred, but the work efficiency is far too poor.
What are you saying?
Everyone is already on the ships, waiting for us!
No one is planning on coming back here and working!
That's because they never explained to us the meaning behind the work.
I will show them the meaning.
They will work for the glory of the great Wizard Zeref!
But... who would choose to continue sacrificing themselves?
Sacrifice?
That's not what I need now.
Zaref taught me, you see.
Jellal, please, open your eyes!
My eyes are already open.
I have no more need for you.
However I will allow you to live.
Since you eliminated all those who stood in my way for me.
You will leave this island and have your fill of that transient freedom.
Jellal...
But you will never speak of this to anyone.
If the government finds out about this Tower of Heaven, it will be quite troublesome.
If you try to tell someone, I will have to destroy this tower and everyone in it.
You are also forbidden to come near here.
If you set even one foot...
Yes, I think that'll do...
First, I will make Sho disappear...
Jellal...
That will be your freedom!
Live knowing that your friends' lives hang on your shoulders, Erza!
We have no other option than firing Etherion from the Satellite Square!
The R-system is a forbidden magic that must be erased from the annals of history.
You do understand what this means, right everyone?
An attack from Etherion will return everything to nothingness.
Even if there are citizens there!
And Jellal, your younger twin brother, will disappear as well, you know!
Are you sure about that?
I've come to terms with that.
All of us came this far due to the sacrifices of others.
That is the Magic World of today.
Elder Leiji!
It will go down in history that our country committed the crime
of attacking the land of Ka Elm without provocation!
That means we'll have to sacrifice ourselves as well.
Elder Belno!
The dead cannot return to life!
When it comes time to teach the children how precious life is, that is what we must say!
We must put an end to this.
I concur with firing Etherion.
Only one more...
Only one more, yes?
One more and then it is game over.
Fish...
We played our hearts out.
By the way... Where are we?
Wait a second, Erza.
That Zeref that was in your story...
Yes, you should know about Zeref too.
I'm pretty sure they called that monster that came out of the Lullaby one of Zeref's demons.
That's not all.
I suspect that Deliora was also one of the Zeref's demons.
And Jellal is trying to resurrect this Zeref person?
I don't understand his motive.
Sho... One of my friends in the past...
He said something about when the resurrection was complete, they'd become rulers over heaven...
But what I don't understand is why your past allies turned against you.
Wasn't the traitor Jellal and not you, Erza?
He must have indoctrinated them somehow after I disappeared.
But I left them here for 8 years.
The fact is, I did betray them.
But it was for their sake!
And yet...
Enough, Lucy.
If I can defeat Jellal, this will all be over.
Is that really the truth?
Whether I win or lose this battle, I will vanish from this world...
Those words are really bothering me.
Sister... That story...
What is that supposed to mean?
Sho...
You trying to get sympathy from your pals with that tall tale?
Give me a break!
That's not even close to the truth!
You blew up our ships and ran away by yourself!
If Jellal hadn't noticed your betrayal, we would have all sunk into the sea!
Jellal told us that was the fate of those who didn't learn the proper way to use magic!
You were drunk from the power of magic! You tried to rid yourself of all of us and your past!
Jellal told you this?
Is that something the Erza you know would have done?
What do you know?
You don't know anything about us!
Only Jellal's words were able to save us.
That's why we spent these past 8 years finishing this tower!
For Jellal...
If... it was all a lie...
If you are right, Sis... And Jellal is wrong...
That's right.
It's you!
Please wait, Gray-sama.
Back then, he purposefully attacked your ice-clone.
What?
There is no way a user of darkness techniques would not be able to notice.
Juvia came here to ascertain his true intentions.
I see Phantom's Element 4 deserves their reputation.
What's going on?
Sho, I put on a performance to both trick you and get them to come to the tower.
W-Why? Why would you...
Sho...
Everyone has been fooled by Jellal.
I played the fool as well until the time was right.
Simon, you...
I believed in you, Erza.
I always did for these past 8 years.
I'm glad we could meet, Erza.
From the bottom of my heart...
Simon...
How...
How could you believe in her so much?
Why...
Why wasn't I able to believe in her?
Damn!
What is the truth?
What should I believe in?
It must be difficult to accept it all at once.
But let me say this much...
For these past 8 years, I have never forgotten about you.
I couldn't do anything for you.
I'm sorry I was so weak...
But now you can do it.
Isn't that right?
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.
Waiting for a number of powerful wizards to gather here.
Powerful wizards?
To fight Jellal.
We'll all work together.
First, we have to prevent Wally and Salamander from clashing.
What's with this room?
It's kitty-city.
Ooh, I like this one!
It's a helmet!
Let's go, Happy!
Aye, sir!
Or something...
Huh?
D'oh...
Well, it's funny so whatever!
Dandy...
Okay! I win again!
That's 9 wins in a row.
Play me again!
This time I'm going to win, for sure!
Natsu, you say that every time.
I'm tired already.
Then I win by default, right?
All right! I win!
Next time: Heaven's Game
It's against the rules to change the rules unilaterally!
Freeedddooom!
Uh, I think he broke.
