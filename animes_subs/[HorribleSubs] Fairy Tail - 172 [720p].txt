Do you know what it means to dis Sabertooth?
I'm going to teach you with her body!
Stop this!
She'll destroy the Celestial Spirit wizard!
Stop the competition!
The referee has stopped it!
The competition is over!
The winner is Minerva!
Sabertooth really is strong!
Lucy hasn't moved for a while, but is she okay?!
Lucy!
Are you okay?!
Hang in there!
How could you do this to her, you witch?!
Get the Celestial Spirit Wizard to the infirmary immediately!
No! I'll give her emergency treatment first!
I'll help you!
Lucy, hang in there!
What are you staring at?
Lucy-san!
She's terribly wounded, but if we do it together...
I asked you, what are you looking at?
I acted within the rules of the competition.
Rules, you say?
You mean torturing an opponent who's already lost?
The crowd ate it up, didn't they?
Lucy should be grateful.
I let her be in second place.
Even though the girl is a useless piece of garbage...
What?!
Uh-oh! What's this?!
Are both teams about to rumble?!
They're gonna start somethin' here?!
Sabertooth versus Fairy Tail!
We need to keep things calm here.
But the crowd loves it!
Thank you very much!
This is one of those unavoidable fate things, y'know?
Fro thinks so, too...
This isn't an official match.
If they really do this, we'll go out there, too.
Aye, sir!
Calm down, for crying out loud!
Wild...
Things are getting pretty lively around here-kabo...
What should we do?
Lucy...
Men...
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
I don't care if you're the strongest or number one in Fiore,
I'll just tell you one thing.
You people...
The Perfume I Dedicate to You!
Lucy, are you alright?
Is Lucy okay?!
Lucy!
You guys...
Even though we're on different teams, we're all in the same guild.
Laxus!
So, how is she?
Thanks to Wendy, her life isn't in danger.
No, it was because of Cheria's emergency treatment.
Thank goodness...
And it looks like her major wounds are gone, so I'm relieved.
Those bastards...
I know what you wanna say...
Lucy...
Everyone... I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizin'?
I blew it again...
What are you talking about?! We took second place thanks to you, Lucy!
We got eight points!
Yeah. You did very well.
My keys...
Here they are.
Thank goodness! Thank you!
Looks like she fell asleep...
It's like they've got us all feeling down...
Sabertooth...
I don't like'em...
Master!
A team, B team... You're all here?
Good.
I'm not sure if this is good news or bad news.
The administrators told me that teams A and B must combine.
What?!
Teams A and B have to unite?
Why?
The disqualification of Raven Tail brings the number of teams down to seven,
and having an odd number doesn't work when it comes to matching up for the battle part.
Therefore, both of our teams must become one
and we have to choose the five members again.
Choose five members?
What about our points?
Apparently, the lower score will carry over.
In other words, A team's 35 points...
How cruel!
But if that's the administration's decision, there's nothing we can do about it.
Well, looking at the bright side, we'll be able to put together an even stronger team.
But even if we decide on five people here,
the remaining events will all just be tag-team battles, right?
No. I'm sure that between tomorrow's break and the final day,
there will be a battle involving all five members.
So you should choose carefully.
I'm definitely gonna get revenge for Lucy!
I ain't gonna let'em get away with laughin' at one of our own!
The Fairy Tail team has finished its reorganization,
and we're about to begin the battle part of day four!
Continuing with commentary, we have with us former Council member Yajima-san.
Thank you.
And our special guest today is Rabian-san, leader of the Scheherazade Theatrical Troupe.
The Grand Magic Games X791
It's an honor. Thank you very much.
The battle part for the fourth day are tag-team matches, right?
Two against two? I can't wait!
Thank you very much!
Alright, I will now announce the match-ups for the battles!
Everyone, please direct your eyes to Lacrima-Vision!
The first match is Blue Pegasus versus Quatro Puppy!
The second match is Mermaid Heel versus Lamia Scale!
The third match is Sabertooth versus Fairy Tail!
And now, here comes the new Fairy Tail team!
Good luck, everyone.
I'm countin' on you guys.
This really is the strongest team, right?
I'll be cheering you on!
Do your best!
This is an awesome team!
I can't even picture these members failing.
The thoughts of our guild have become one.
We're entrusting this feeling to the gods!
Now is the time to show them all
the power of our bond!
The whole arena is shaking!
Right here and now...
As you might expect,
everyone's waiting for Fairy Tail versus Sabertooth, who were nearly about to brawl.
I didn't know what was going to happen then.
It certainly was a heated moment. Thank you very much.
The Celestial Spirit Wizard isn't there.
Apparently, she's in the infirmary.
Don't you even think about any heavy-handed action like last time!
Oh, no.
Admittedly, that was a blunder.
Next time, I shall use a somewhat more reliable means.
But for the moment, let's enjoy the festival.
The plan will be set in motion three days hence.
Eclipse...
It will change the world.
And already, there is no way to stop it?
Lord Zeref is waiting...
I'm fired up.
Festival, eh?
The Grand Magic Games...
Although it once went by another name...
The Festival of the Dragon King...
A feast for dragons, humans, and demons...
Alright, the first tag-team battle!
From Blue Pegasus, Ichiya and Rabbit
versus Bacchus and Rocker from Quatro Puppy!
Wild...
Bacchus-san, let's get wild with these guys.
At the rate we're goin'...
What? My soul is quivering. That's enough.
Well?
O-Oh, my! This is beautiful...
Opponents shaking hands before what's sure to be a fierce battle!
Too beautiful for words! Thank you very much!
The rabbit and I are gonna...?
His hand smells kinda good-four...
At last, the time has come to unleash you.
The rabbit!
We'll finally find out who it really is!
We don't even know who the rabbit is...
Who could it be...
What the hell are you two doing?!
Please pay attention to Ichiya-san's match!
Go ahead and show them...
He's...
Double Handsome Attack!
No way!
Gross!
Nichiya?!
This is a dangerous...
There are...
Double Handsome Attack!
Pull yourself together!
That's not wild at all!
In the first place, you're disqualified if somebody outside of Blue Pegasus participates!
Look!
Before the Grand Magic Games began,
Nichiya-chan became a full-fledged member of our guild!
With looks like that, he's plenty qualified to be one of us!
But how did Nichiya end up joining Blue Pegasus?
It was an encounter with myself...
It was fate indeed.
Yes. It happened one sunny afternoon...
Sensing the parfum of an attractive person, I entered a forest.
I walked on and on, but nothing appeared...
It was then I thought that perhaps...
So I tried to leave,
but only succeeded in walking deeper and deeper into the forest.
Finally, starving and dehydrated, I collapsed.
But luckily,
that forest was the abode of Exceeds who came to Earthland.
What a beautiful human!
What a beautiful cat!
Hey! Get a grip!
Is there something that you'd like?
A glass of water...
Sure. Right away.
Refreshing at a time like this...
Little did I know that this development
would become a classic romantic drama parfum.
I'm sorry.
Thanks to that, I'm refreshed-men.
I'm glad to hear that-men.
Men...
Men!
Men...
Men!
Men...!
This is the parfum of passionate friendship.
Until you recover your strength, refresh yourself here in this forest.
And so, our friendship deepened even more.
It's the parfum of memories that are just too beautiful.
What did you do?!
Men!
Ichiya-san! Can he even fight?!
Naturally!
He's got the same face as me!
In other words...
Looks to me like he's dead!
It can't be!
Four... Time to stop messin' around...
For us, it's now or never,
so we're gonna win this.
Suddenly the revealed identity of the bunny is down!
That makes it two against one.
Game over, then?
Thank you very much!
Hold on, you two!
Drilling rock for you!
Drunken Cleaving Hook Palm, Under the Moon!
Men!
Ichiya...
Nichi...ya...
It's gonna be over now!
Eat this!
I got you involved in this battle...
I didn't realize you were a gentleman who couldn't fight...
Drilling rock for you!
And yet,
you chose the path of fighting alongside us.
And you're incredibly handsome...
Why are you on the ground?
Why are you hurt?!
Oh, boy! Is this the end of the match?!
First the cat in the bunny suit, now Blue Pegasus's Ichiya is down!
Wild...
Wait, not yet!
It looks like Ichiya of Blue Pegasus is going to stand up!
I won't let your feelings go to waste!
Handsomeness is justice!
Muscle-men!
Men-men-muscle-men!
Muscle-men-men!
H-How'd he suddenly turn wild...?
That's the power of parfum!
I dedicate this to you...
The parfum called victory!
Ichiya-san?!
This is kind of touching...
Wild Four!
Drilling rock for you!
My soul is quivering!
Drunken Cleaving Hook Palm!
Take this! It's my...
Smile!
Smash!
Down! Quatro Puppy is down!
The winner is Blue Pegasus!
Men!
Against Bacchus...
He won, two against one...
It looks like he's not just an idiot.
Nah, he's awesome!
How handsome can you get?
That's our blue angel.
He's so cool!
I knew Ichiya-san could do it!
Are you okay, Nichiya?
Wasn't very... Men... of me...
Wow, what a great match, huh?
I-I suppose...?
It was extremely disgusting. Thank you very much.
Alright, on to the second match!
Lyon and Yuka from Lamia Scale!
Versus Kagura and Millianna from Mermaid Heel!
Lyon and Kagura, huh? This should be interesting.
Alright, on to the second match.
Commentator Natsu-san, what do you have to say about this match-up?
Lyon often picks fights with Gray, so he's okay in my book!
Regarding Yuka, back when we were on Galuna Island,
he shot me with that shocking thing.
Uh-huh...
I don't know about Kagura!
Millianna's easy to beat,'cause all you gotta do is dress like a cat
and she goes gooey-eyed!
Next time: Battle of the Dragon Slayers!
Thank you, Natsu-san! I knew you would explain in a way that's easy to understand.
It was nothin'!
