High School Championship Tokyo Regional Final Tournament Bracket
Mizusawa High School Homei High School Hokuo Academy Shoha High School
The top two teams get to go to Nationals, right?
We don't need to try that hard then.
How can you say that, President Amakasu?!
Have you forgotten how we were humiliated last year?!
We must defeat Mizusawa and reclaim our trophy!
What? That's too much effort.
Whatever.
We still have our Retrot cards.
Tell us the enemy order so we can win
with a minimal amount of effort.
We'll go after those three.
Mizusawa has one Class B and two Class C players.
If we know their order, we can guarantee three wins.
Retro's never been wrong before.
Well, we're counting on you.
Retrot
Chihaya Furu
Verse 5
Be as dear now, those were the good old days
Hey, why do they put all the responsibility on you?
Are you getting enough rest?
Well?
What order should we go with?
Not sure.
It'll help if we can out think Hokuo.
But it's great that we still go to Nationals, even if we lose.
This means we can relax...
What are you talking about?
Our goal is to become number one in Japan!
To become number one in Japan, we can never lose!
Hokuo will give us their best shot.
We'll take it back next year!
We get to play a 100 serious match!
Well, it's a good idea to aim high.
I'm a little worried about the ultimate weapon Retro-kun mentioned.
Here, drink this.
Honestly, you can't do anything without me.
S-Sis?!
I got a boyfriend recently who's totally hooked on me!
Retro-kun is her boyfriend?!
Is this the ultimate weapon he mentioned?!
Excuse me.
I went over to scout the other team
during their semi-final match,
and I heard their president talking, since he wasn't playing.
It'll be easy to win against Mizusawa.
I just have to beat Mashima.
We only need three wins.
Any one of our regular starters
can beat glasses boy and boobie girl.
Huh? He ignored us?
No way!
They wouldn't be so conservative in the final match!
No, Chihaya.
This is how the strong schools play.
It makes sense to focus on securing wins.
If they can guess our order, they'll use that against us.
That's fine.
We just need one or two of us to pull off an upset!
I just have to beat Mashima.
I'm mad now!
Any one of our regular starters
can beat glasses boy and boobie girl.
I'll make him regret that!
Boobie girl?!
Our captain wants us to become number one in Japan!
No trickery!
Nishida Yusei Oe Kana Ayase Chihaya Komano Tsutomu Mashima Taichi
Here's the order we'll use!
Oh, I'll turn in the order.
Yeah, thanks.
Wait, hey!
Not again! Why you...
But Oe-senpai looks a little tired.
That doesn't make it okay to change anything!
You lost your match earlier!
But I was getting better as I played.
I think I can win my next match!
Your methods are wrong.
But! But!
I'll be more useful than someone who's tired!
Enough!
Starting today, the boys in this club aren't allowed
to start sentences with but!
What?!
Just the boys?!
We're sticking with a second-year order!
You're a spectator, Tsukuba!
Good thing I'm a girl.
The president snapped...
Ta-Taichi...
Why are you telling them not to use but?
I've been following that rule since third grade.
Huh?
Men should never begin a sentence with the word but!
I didn't always agree with my mother,
but she taught me to pay attention to when I'm making excuses.
I'm a little scared of your mom...
but that's incredible.
Your mom helped you become strong.
This year, Hokuo is lead by the third-year Class A Amakasu.
The first-year Shiroyama is also in Class A.
A first-year in Class A?
The other players are in Class B.
Schools with real coaches have way more depth.
Our coach is a science and PE teacher.
Okay, everyone! We've reached the final!
Stay focused!
To ensure that all the practice we put in after
last year's loss will pay off, I have an ultimate weapon...
We lost last year because we
correctly guessed their order, but failed to use that advantage.
That won't be an issue this year.
This will be easy.
Retro's Projected Order Oe (C) - Shiroyama Ayase (A) - Kameda Mashima (B) - Amakas Nishida (A) - Takuma Komano (C) - Kinashi <- Me
Even if we lose to Ayase and Nishida,
we're guaranteed to win the other three matches.
After we win the final with a minimal amount of energy,
the coach will buy us yakiniku!
Yeah!
Fight!
I will now read the order for the final match.
Hokuo Academy, Shiroyama-kun.
Mizusawa High School, Nishida-kun.
Huh?
Huh?
Hokuo Academy, Kameda-kun.
Mizusawa High School, Oe-san.
Hokuo Academy, Amakasu-kun.
Mizusawa High School, Ayase-san.
Hokuo Academy, Takuma-kun.
Mizusawa High School, Komano-kun.
Hokuo Academy, Kinashi-kun.
Mizusawa High School, Mashima-kun.
What's going on?
They're playing us straight?
Hey, Retro!
What are you thinking?!
Your projected order was completely different!
Amakasu-kun, calm down!
What are you trying to pull?!
He can't predict the order correctly every time!
Was your prediction wrong?! Well?!
Why should we conserve our energy?
What?!
Aren't we supposed to be Hokuo Academy?
Our ace against their ace.
Our number two against their number two.
Isn't that how we should win?!
Hokuo Academy is the strongest school in Tokyo!
That's what I want to show everyone!
H-He's so cool!
You're going to cost us this match because of your pride!
Being good doesn't mean you have to win straight up!
Hokuo Academy is the strongest school in Tokyo?
Isn't that common sense?
You're late, Sudo-senpai!
I'm not late.
I made it just in time.
Though I would have left, if you didn't reach the finals.
E-Err, Sudo-senpai? Why are you here?
I didn't know you were coming to cheer for us.
I'm not here to cheer for you.
Mochida-san asked me to be the reader for the final.
Reader?
Who is that?
The former Hokuo Academy ace, Sudo-san.
He was the runner-up in the individual bracket of the National Championship.
Huh?
Is someone like him allowed to be the reader?
Get to your places.
Hokuo players never dawdle!
How come Retro knew and I didn't, when I'm in charge,
Mr Mochida?
Amakasu-kun, you're a good player,
but you always want to relax.
You've given up on becoming the best in Class A
with all these monsters around.
Sadist
Monster
Bear
This is tough... Very tough...
But...
If we lose, he'll kill us.
Their facial expressions have changed.
He's putting pressure on Hokuo, not us.
Their ultimate weapon...
Ms. Miyauchi?
Sorry about showing up at the last second.
I had an idea to make these yesterday,
and I just put on the finishing touches.
It should be easier for you to move around now.
Tasuki...
I can move now.
I don't feel as hot now.
You made it just in time.
Ms. Miyauchi...
You might be a science and PE teacher...
You might not know much about karuta...
Please begin placing your cards.
Good luck.
You look pretty sharp...
at least on the outside.
However, I'm going to win today.
I will win.
Retro...
He's entered tournaments in Hiroshima and Kyoto,
and he's still Class B because he couldn't win.
Hiroshima Tournament
It's him again!
Ogura Hundred Poets Competitive Karuta Kyoto Tournament
Not again!
I'm getting sick of his face,
but it was comforting at the same time.
He hasn't given up on himself yet.
Your mom helped you become strong.
Chihaya...
A lot of people have helped to make me who I am.
Aren't you the same way?
This sucks.
It's so exhausting to play someone who's intense.
Why can't they learn to take it easy?
This would be a lot easier if we still had Sudo-senpai,
but he's gone now.
He's gone...
If you don't pull it together, I'll stab you
Both teams have secured their places in the finals.
They could end up wearing each other out.
So why...
is it so tense?
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
His voice is much stronger than I expected.
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
The air conditioner above us is still broken,
but it's not as hot now.
Thank you, Ms. Miyauchi.
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
They can keep the air conditioning off.
The only sound I need is...
Shallow waves creep closer...
They're too fast! They're both way too fast!
Who got that one?
The little Hokuo guy?
Chihaya-chan was looking at the Swift card on the opponent side.
Both start with the same S sound.
She was being cautious since she doesn't know this reader.
I should have gotten that one.
I just need another 3 millimeters.
If my finger had been right on the corner...
There.
There.
Connect.
Connect.
in my dreams, I creep closer to you
When the misty bridge...
She's lost two of her best cards in a row.
That boy has good sense.
Got it
Rather, I guess, he has good reflexes.
Get back to your seat
A flexible upper body with a snappy and firm spring...
I need to be sharper.
Here.
Here.
This is the point.
The point I want to reach.
I need to be more accurate!
Are you trying to insult me?
Reviewing your mistakes between cards?
Is this a practice match?
Ah, he makes a good point.
That's my student
You should focus on the next card
instead of the one you just lost.
I've been telling Chihaya-chan that for a very long time.
Here.
Here.
It's okay, Chihaya-chan. Carry on.
You sgould never dwell on the past in a match.
Connect...
Connect!
The sound of birds crossing...
Who is this guy? He's weird.
He moves a little slow, which is throwing me off.
And...
That
hairpin is bugging me!
No matter where I stand...
After I determined...
You're pretty good.
Those boobies should be weighing you down.
is that I have no way to tell you in person
Said bed was cold as I lay awake
for the night would drag on when I thought of my beloved
Sudo-san's voice dissipates into the air.
As my love first came...
I can trust him!
Four in a row?
Excuse me.
I take that back.
Sudo-kun is pretty good.
His rhythm is accurate and his enunciation is clear.
Did you have him read when he was still on the team?
I can't imagine that he was interested in reading during practice.
Well, that was the case before he reached middle school.
Mr. Mochida.
I'm going to attend a class for readers.
I believe that Master Suo has spent more time
studying readers than he has studying cards or opponents.
Sudo-kun's strength...
I'll be the one who crushes the Master
is drawn from his pride.
It's ironic, but the people who have the most pride
are the ones willing to put in the hard work.
Looking up every step of the way.
I thought she was faster, but I guess I was wrong.
I'm already 7 cards up.
This should be a fairly easy win.
What is she doing?
She's being really sensitive about her motion...
Focused on her accuracy...
Is she looking at Wakamiya Shinobu?
That's impossible!
I lost by 24 cards last year,
and you lost by 20 cards, too!
She's strong enough to give you nightmares!
She's out of our reach.
Connect... Connect...
Connect... One more millimeter...
You can keep your eyes focused on a distant goal,
while you lose the match you're in.
My own sleeves are like...
Good!
He was fast on that one.
He moved towards My own home before returning to My own sleeves.
Hokuo's players are pulling ahead.
It was only six months ago that we were
experiencing Sudo-san's pressure, glares, and voice every day.
We have a home advantage when Sudo-san is the reader!
Feel sorrow wash...
Retro!
Why do you always use strange motions?!
That was cool!
Your fingers are injured and taped up,
but you insist on worming them in!
Win!
Win!
Win!
The sky may hold the same moon
I'm in trouble. Boobie girl is good.
It's our fifth match, but I'm still able to move around.
Mom made sure that my sash was tied tight,
and I have the tasuki from Ms. Miyauchi.
I tire less easily in a kimono.
Oh, crap.
I'll be in big trouble if I lose to boobie girl.
You probably wouldn't know,
but a kimono is designed perfectly
for moving around with boobies!
The more I learn about competitive karuta,
the more magical it seems.
Gender doesn't matter.
Size doesn't matter.
Intelligence and strength don't matter.
Age doesn't matter.
Would this old palace courtyard and the eaves strewn with weeds
Every poem read sends you back a thousand years.
How many sports are capable of such a feat?
Thank you very much!
Huh?
One win for Hokuo!
Yes!
Way to go, Shiroyama!
What?
Porky was crushed?!
Lost by 13 cards
This is bad.
The first victory in a team match is critical.
The losing side feels a lot more pressure.
So even when you're losing,
it's important to drag out the match...
Yet he lost this early!
It's been so long since I played five matches in a row
and my head's starting to spin.
Those circles kept bothering me.
I got distracted every time I saw Sis.
You're so awesome, Retro-kun!
But...
Not allowed to start sentences with But...
I thought we could count on Nishida...
What about everyone else?
How are Oe-san and Komano doing?
They're in close matches.
What about Chihaya?
Huh?
Chihaya's losing by 5 cards?
Chi
I'm in a close match myself.
I don't have time to ask her how's she doing.
If I speak, it'll be to signal Mizusawa's first win!
You're trying to copy Wakamiya Shinobu's style,
but you're closer to Suo Hisashi's style right now.
Porky, I've always wanted to become something I wasn't close to.
She can accurately and precisely
touch an exact point with her fingertips...
She plays silent karuta...
However, I can't beat Amakusa-kun with my accuracy right now.
It's not easy to be as good as Shinobu-chan.
You have twenty!
Twenty one-syllable cards!
In the sleepy spring sunlight,
Chihaya-chan, are you...
