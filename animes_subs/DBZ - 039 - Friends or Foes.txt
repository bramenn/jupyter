I am bored to death.
I've had it. This is still only the seventh day, too.
We've still got twenty-some days to go. I should have installed hibernation devices.
Are you guys image training again?
Nice for you to be able to pass the time.
Wow, you're not bad! You sure are strong.
You've inherited Goku's blood, and you've been trained by Piccolo, after all.
Still, I was surprised by how many techniques you have, Kuririn.
Listen...
It's fine for you to train inside your heads,
but the room is starting to get pretty messy, so would you tidy it up for us?
There's a lady present.
B- but Bulma- san, you're the one who made it messy over there.
We've cleaned up our own messes.
I'm busy here! I've got a lot of things to think about.
You guys are just passengers, so that's fine for you.
I thought you just got done saying that you were bored.
You hush! I wish you would show a little more consideration toward a delicate lady.
So busy, so busy...
As a lady, I sure wish she wouldn't stroll around in her underwear.
Oh, not again.
Four more.
Son- san, you mustn't do that!
Nurse, I'm all better now.
Goku is immortal, you see.
Did I just do something? Must be my age, but lately, I don't even know what I'm doing.
Oh, for heaven's sake...
These sponge cakes are delicious.
Of all the...
Doctor!
How many times must I say it before it gets through to you?
If you keep doing that, you'll never get to go home.
As you can see, I'm all-
It should hurt. You were very severely injured, after all. Get back to bed.
S- sorry.
You there, Grandpa Glad-hands, give him a hand.
G- Grandpa Glad-hands ?
My word, Grandpa Glad-hands, huh? My, my...
Grandpa Glad-hands !
At your service.
Where is his wife, who is usually with him?
Oh, she probably went to the roof to look up at the sky again.
Gohan- chan, are you doin' all right?
I told you over and over to send me a letter every day,
but you haven't sent a single one...
Come back to me soon, safe and sound.
Say...
By the way, I've been wondering about this for a long time,
but about that Saiyan, Vegeta, who ran away- where did he run away to?
What do you mean, where?
Well, the Saiyans' planet was lost a long time ago, right?
Oh, right. He had taken an awful lot of damage,
so I think it would have to be a civilized planet somewhere.
Could there be such a place?
Earlier, Son- kun's brother mentioned something, remember?
He said that, We exterminate those who live on planets with good environments,
and then sell them to aliens.
Do you think that maybe Vegeta went to one of those aliens' planets to get treated?
If he did, then when he comes back to Earth would depend on where that planet was.
If it were far away, then it would buy us some time.
You know something, that's one terrible fellow who has set his sights on Earth.
T - to think that it would come to this...
-What was that just now? -Something flashed, huh?
It wouldn't be Planet Namek, right?
It's too early for that, to say the least, isn't it?
Huh? Something is approaching.
But I don't see anything.
B- Bulma- san! Flying saucers!
B- Bulma- san!
Leave them to me!
Counterattack!
You got them! You got them!
It's too soon to celebrate. Look!
It's a spaceship.
It's coming closer and closer!
I can see that. It's coming straight toward us.
Is that!?
We're going to hit!
Do something!
H- how could they turn in the same direction!?
W- we're done for!
Where could we be? It looks like the inside of a spaceship,
but even so, there isn't a soul around. I have no idea what's going on here.
There may be some weird aliens hiding from us.
You're right. They might suddenly-
Gohan! Don't scare us like that!
I- it looks like it's safe to go outside. Let's go have a look.
Here goes!
Maybe I should have stayed on Earth after all, like Yajirobe.
Oh, no!
I forgot to put on some pants first.
Huh? But you are wearing them, aren't you?
These are my shorts. Ah, oh well.
Let's hope you don't embarrass mankind.
Kuririn- san...
All right, let's go.
Gohan! Don't push!
Gohan, watch yourself! It looks like there are some booby traps in here.
Remember, you two! Men are to protect ladies at all times! Don't forget that!
There should be a doorway into the main room somewhere-
A wall like this will be easy to take care of.
Kame...
hame...
K- Kuririn!
Kame...
Must be nice for you guys, being able to perform Bukujutsu.
I get the feeling that they want to eliminate any intruders, no matter what.
Is this a Saiyan spaceship?
Beats me.
Suppose Vegeta were to suddenly appear from over there...
C- cut that out! Look, I'm starting to get goosebumps!
I wonder if that man Vegeta is recovering from his injuries somewhere right now.
I'd appreciate it if he'd just die.
K - Kakarrot... remember this... I will definitely go back there to settle the score!
Say, I get the feeling
that we've been walking around the same place in circles for a while now.
There wasn't anything that looked like a door, huh?
There's one!
It looks like the real door is down here.
Yay!
Damn... They sure built this thing to be convoluted!
All right, let's try going in here.
Kuririn, be careful.
I know.
Outer space!
I thought we were dead!
I- I'm getting hungry...
My tummy is grumbling, too.
Something smells good.
Y- you're right.
Wow, that looks delicious.
It might be a trap!
It sure is a spread!
Be careful when touching anything.
You won't catch me falling for that!
Bulma- san!
Help me!
Bulma- san, your reflexes are so slow!
It's you guys who are the unusual ones!
We're coming to help you out now!
Please move away from the cage!
What is this!? Who set this childish trap!?
Don't move!
Bulma- san!
Why, you!
Stay back! I'll be shot!
Kuririn- san, they're all children!
D- don't shoot! We're not your enemy! Is there an adult here that I could speak to?
Never mind about me! Give these kids a good hard spanking!
B- but...
Don't dawdle around! Hurry up!
Okay then...
Kuririn! Don't offer any more futile resistance!
Just hurry and surrender, already!
B- Bulma- san...
K- Kuririn- san?
W- what should we do?
Ominously, these children have suddenly appeared.
What exactly is the true nature of this mysterious spaceship?
