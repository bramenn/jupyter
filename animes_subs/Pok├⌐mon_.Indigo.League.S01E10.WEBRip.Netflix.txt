Our young hero Ash leads his friends deep into the forest.
Since he doesn't have a compass, Ash must rely purely on his instincts.
And that means trouble.
Don't worry. I'm positive this way will take us back to the path.
-Pika. -Positive, huh?
That's what you said an hour ago. I'm tired.
Phew! I told you to stick to the main road,
but you had to take a shortcut.
I took a shortcut? It was you who said to go this way.
Who says we're lost?
Listen, genius, if you don't know where you are or where you're going,
-that means you're lost! -Chill. Chill!
All right, but remind me to yell at you some more
if we ever get to Vermillion City.
Time for a break.
Hmm?
Oh, wow, a Pokemon!
Oddish. This Pokemon is typically found roaming the forest,
scattering pollen as it walks around.
-I'll catch it. -Hold it!
-What for? -Because I'm going to catch that Pokemon.
Aw, no way, Misty. I saw it first.
But we found it around the water and water is my specialty.
Go, Starmie!
Water gun now!
Now, that's the way to spray. Tackle it, Starmie!
That weakened it. Got to catch it now.
-Poke Ball, go! Uh-oh. -Whoa.
Whoa! What's that?
Wow! I can't believe it! A Bulbasaur!
Bulbasaur. It bears the seed of a plant on its back from birth.
The seed slowly develops.
Researchers are unsure whether to classify Bulbasaur as a plant or animal.
Bulbasaur are extremely tough and very difficult to capture in the wild.
Bulbasaur!
-Oh! Oh, Starmie, are you okay? -Now it's my turn to try.
Bulbasaur is mine! Butterfree, I choose you!
Butterfree, Sleep Powder!
Ah! Come on. Hang in there, Butterfree!
Oh, no.
Oh, the Bulbasaur.
-It's not fair! I want it! -Pika.
Heh, I'll bet there are Bulbasaur all over this place.
-But where is this place? -I can't find this bridge on my map.
-Brock's falling. -Ah!
Ash, you have to pull us back up! It's our only chance!
-Pika! - I can't.
Yes, you will! Just pull as hard as you can!
- -Phew. I'm totally wiped out.
We can't rest now.
-We've got to find Brock. -Right.
-Hurry up! -Pika!
-Argh! -Huh?
-Whoa. How'd you get down there? -I fell in! How else?
-What's a trap doing here? -It seems pretty strange.
Just help me out, quick!
-This is just not our day. -Pikachu.
Brock? Hey, Brock!
Think he washed this far downstream?
Whoa!
Hey, how'd we get up in a tree?
It's another trap! Do something!
-What can I do? -Try wiggling. See if the net will open.
-Oh! -Oh, this is dumb!
You got any better ideas, let's hear'em!
-Pi! Pika, pi! -Bulbasaur!
-Huh? -Huh? Bulbasaur.
Saur... Saur.
Hold it there, Bulbasaur! I want a match!
Now you're wiggling too much! Ouch, you kicked me!
Oh, Bulbasaur!
The village we're looking for should be on the other side of that bridge.
Let's just hope the rumors are true.
Just wait and see what Team Rocket's got planned for you,
you delicious little village.
Gee, I wonder what happened to Brock.
I wonder too.
Maybe the river carried him far away, all the way to the ocean.
Then some pirates spotted him and brought him aboard their ship.
And one of the pirates has a wooden leg.
-You have a crazy imagination. -Pikachu!
Then came the storm.
- Ahoy! - Huh?
Hey, Brock!
Why are you hanging around up in that tree?
Thanks, but maybe next time, you could let us down a little more gently.
Yeah, sure. Sorry.
We've been looking all over for you.
We saw you fall into the river. Then what happened?
Well, I was being washed away in the rapids.
I've got you. Just hold on.
The girl who saved my life was incredibly beautiful.
Hm, a beautiful girl, huh? That's even better than pirates.
Unless, of course, she was really a pirate in disguise.
Maybe it's time to get a reality check.
-Oh! -Melanie, this is Ash and Misty.
-Hello. -So you're Brock's friends.
-He told me all about you. -Great.
Wow, look at that!
-Do all those Pokemon belong to you? - Oh, no.
This is a place where Pokemon are able to rest and relax.
-Like summer camp? -Well, sort of, but all year long.
You see, when Pokemon get abandoned or injured, they can come here.
Melanie takes care of them until they feel better. Then they leave.
So this is a Pokemon center and Melanie is a Pokemon doctor.
Oh, no. I'm not qualified to be a Pokemon doctor.
-This is more like a Pokemon health spa. -Huh?
Here, the Pokemon don't battle with one another.
They relax and try to enjoy themselves until they've recovered.
Cool.
Melanie collects plants to use for medicine.
She knows all about which plants can help a Pokemon feel better
or grow stronger when it's too weak.
So you and Melanie both love to take care of Pokemon.
We do.
Well, it looks to me like there's something else Brock might love, heh.
-Be quiet! She might hear you! -Heh.
I wonder who put that net up in the tree.
Probably the same person who dug the hole I fell into.
I'm sorry. I was the one who set those traps.
I wanted to catch Pokemon trainers before they reached the village.
Since you got caught, I guess they really worked, heh.
-But why? -There are so many injured Pokemon here.
I have to protect them.
-So the bridge was a trap too. -Yes.
Across this bridge lies a lifetime supply of Pokemon.
How are we ever going to carry them all?
Don't worry, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
I promised Melanie we wouldn't capture any Pokemon here.
And did you seal the promise with a kiss? Ow!
So that must mean you really do love her. Ow!
Well, I guess I'll have to keep your promise.
Only bad guys try to capture sick Pokemon.
But are those traps tough enough to keep robbers away from this place?
I mean, you'd have to be pretty stupid
-to fall into one of those holes. -Hey!
This is the third hole we've fallen into.
How come nobody ever falls into our traps but we always fall into theirs?
Well, this one was very cleverly hidden, well made, and-
-I'm glad you're enjoying it so much! -Meowth!
- Help me out! Help me out! - Get us out of here!
Ouch, my tail! Let go! Stop pulling my tail!
Do you feel any better yet, Staryu?
Sorry about what happened in the forest.
Oddish.
I shouldn't have surprised you like that, heh. You must've been scared.
Oddish.
Melanie told me your old trainer got rid of you.
Was it really because he thought you were too weak?
Oddish.
You know, some trainers can be insensitive.
But not all of us are mean like that.
You just need to find a trainer who understands you.
Anyway, I'm sorry for what I did and I hope we can become friends.
Oddish.
-Huh? -Oddish. Oddish.
You're sweet, Oddish. I am sorry.
All I think about lately is winning. I hope I'm not becoming heartless.
-You were always heartless. -Mind your own business!
Bulbasaur!
-Hey, it's rude to tackle people! -She's right.
I know. You're just mad because I was going to beat you.
-But you chickened out and ran off. -That must be it.
Then let's see how tough you really are.
- Please wait. Please. -Huh?
Bulbasaur is only trying to protect Oddish.
Bulbasaur volunteered to guard our whole village.
- Huh? -It protects all the injured Pokemon
whenever enemies try to attack them.
Oh.
Bulbasaur is the bravest and most loyal Pokemon I know.
So that's why Bulbasaur attacked me.
It must've thought I was taking Oddish from the village.
Now what?
Bulbasaur doesn't like Pokemon trainers. It wants you to leave the village now.
But we're not here to capture Pokemon. We want to help you.
It's true, Bulbasaur. These are our friends.
Bulbasaur was worried about the other Pokemon,
so it decided to be the village bodyguard. Now, that's what I call bravery.
It would be great to have a Pokemon like that.
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the stars above.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
-Surrender now or prepare to fight. -That's right.
We've said our lines. Time to attack the village.
Those village idiots thought their measly traps would stop us.
They thought they had the home team advantage.
No such luck. We're the home team now.
I congratulate myself for this brilliant scheme.
Don't forget, I suggested tying balloons on the stadium roof.
-Here we go again. -Today only at Jessie stadium.
-It's the Team Rocket Pokemon challenge. -The flying stadium was my idea.
Oh, heh.
All Pokemon are invited to enter the stadium.
Step right up.
Yeah, we're not hosing you. Well, maybe we are.
They never run out of ideas, do they?
Hurry! Everybody get in the cabin!
Wait. No! Oddish!
Bulbasaur.
-Bulbasaur! -Take Staryu.
Keep going, Bulbasaur! Ugh.
That rotten little pest. He's always ruining our flawless plans.
Not this time. He's gathered them all in one place for us.
Our super-vacuum will suck up them up.
Let's go, team! To steal them is our dream!
Let's go, Rocket! Put Pokemon in our pocket!
Pidgeotto, I choose you!
Pidgeotto, Gust attack!
-And the tornado's winding up. -But will it strike us out?
There goes the whole ballgame.
The home team really got blown away.
So what are we going to do now, challenge them to wind surfing?
Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again.
Is everyone feeling okay?
I just had the wind knocked out of me.
Bulbasaur.
This village is well-protected with Bulbasaur here.
Ash, don't you agree that Bulbasaur would be an excellent addition to your team?
Oh, yeah, would he ever!
-I think Bulbasaur should go with you. -Huh?
Bulbasaur stayed here to protect the weaker Pokemon.
But this village is too small. The bulb on its back can't grow.
It needs to go out into the world now and I know you'll take good care of it.
Please do me this favor. Take Bulbasaur with you on your journey.
He'll be a good companion.
But what will happen to the village without Bulbasaur?
Yeah, who's going to protect you?
It's true that Bulbasaur has done a great job, maybe too great a job.
You see, these Pokemon shouldn't remain in this village forever and ever.
After they recover, the Pokemon are supposed to leave.
But it's too safe here, so none of them wants to go away.
They don't want to return to the outside world.
Oddish.
But I think it's important that all of them return to the wild.
That's where Pokemon belong.
And hopefully, someday, they'll find good trainers like you.
Of course, taking care of sick Pokemon will always be my mission
but I know my job isn't finished until they return where they came from,
so it's the day a Pokemon leaves that is most rewarding to me.
Melanie, I-
So you see, it's time for Bulbasaur to leave here.
Please take it with you. It won't be a burden, I promise.
Bulbasaur still has a lot of growing to do.
I want it to be in a place where I'm sure it can grow strong and happy.
I'm sure that place is with you, Ash.
Well, if you really want me to.
Bulbasaur.
What did it say?
Bulbasaur will join you on one condition. It wants to battle you in a Pokemon match.
-Right, Bulbasaur? -Bulbasaur.
Oh, please let me battle with Bulbasaur.
-Please? Pretty please? -No way.
-Pika. -Bulbasaur.
Pikachu, go!
Pikachu! Look out, Pikachu!
Ah! The Vine Whip is Bulbasaur's special move.
Ah, Pikachu, Thunderbolt!
All right. Poke Ball, go!
We did it! We got Bulbasaur.
Pikachu.
Bulbasaur, I'll miss you.
Have a safe trip.
I promise to take good care of Bulbasaur.
Bulbasaur, thank you for watching over us.
-Uh, Melanie, I've been thinking. -Yes?
Well, since Bulbasaur is leaving,
I wouldn't mind staying and helping you out.
It's very kind of you but we'll be okay.
I wouldn't want to keep you from all of your wonderful adventures.
Oh. Yeah, I guess you're right.
-Goodbye, Melanie. -Goodbye. Good luck.
Bulbasaur.
Don't worry, Bulbasaur. You'll see your friends again.
As soon as the Pokemon feel better, they'll leave this village too.
Bulba.
Take good care of each other. Bye-bye.
So what did Melanie say when you told her you loved her?
-Did you kiss her goodbye? -That's enough stupid questions.
Would you please stop embarrassing me already? You know, okay, so she's cute.
-I understand that! -
Did I miss something? What's going on?
Bulba.
With Bulbasaur now at his side,
it looks like Ash is building his own dream team.
Now it's on to Vermilion City.
Let's just hope our heroes don't take any more shortcuts,
or we may never get there.
