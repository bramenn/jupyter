From one fierce battle after another,
we Alliance members had finally defeated all the members of Oracion Seis!
But that triggered the seal on Brain's alternate personality, Master Zero, to unlock!
What'll we do?!
I wonder for how long...
How long will I be able to remain anchored at this harbor known as battle?
That's him!
Jellal!
Wendy!
You're safe? I'm glad.
Yes.
Jellal...
Who are you?
I knew it... He forgot...
Jellal's memories are all jumbled up right now.
He doesn't seem to remember about you, or me.
Memories?
I see... Then that's why...
From Pegasus to the Fairies!
Wendy Marvel?
Did we know each other?
Please don't tell me you've also forgotten how to stop Nirvana...
W-Well...
A self-destruct magic circle will no longer work.
I don't know of any other way...
I apologize.
But...
Hold it right there!
Then, what is going to happen to our guild?
It's right up ahead!
If we don't stop it soon, then...
What's that?
What are you so afraid of? This is our fate.
Nabula! Punishment for our great sin...
Everyone should just be destroyed!
That's...
Caitshelter!
Don't tell me... This light... This magic power...
Nirvana is going to fire?!
Oh, no!
Stop it!
What?!
It missed!
Something has...
Men! Men-men-men-men-men...
Ow.
Nirvana's leg...
Who could have done this?
That's...
The magical bomber, Christina!
It's on our side?
Can you hear me?
Somebody... Somebody, respond!
If you are safe, please respond!
That voice... Is that you, Hibiki?
Erza-san!
And you're safe too, I see, Wendy-chan.
By the way, I'm safe as well...
Senpai! Thank goodness.
What happened? I thought Christina was shot down...
It was shot out of the sky like nothing by those guys near the entrance to the Woodsea.
So it could still fly?
Yeah... We managed, somehow.
We're just a temporary alliance, so teamwork is all the more important.
Lyon is using his Creation magic to replace the wing that was destroyed from their attack.
This is pretty tough...
The hull, which was split into pieces,
is being held together by Sherry-san's Doll Attack and Ren's Air Magic.
I've never manipulated something so big!
Y-You call this h-heavy?
The attack from before was Eve's Snow Magic.
You guys...
I fused together the magic bombs that Christina had on board,
but all we could take out was one leg...
It's... just that sturdy...
And... now... my magic power is...
Eve...
Eve, hang in there!
I'm not doing so well over here, either!
Not yet! A little more!
Everyone...
Thank you...
Thank you, everyone!
As you can hear, we're reaching the limit of our magic power.
We can't attack from the ship any longer.
And I don't know how long we'll be able to stay in the air.
Don't worry about us.
Just listen to this, before it's too late.
It took a long time, but I finally found it inside the Archive!
The way to stop Nirvana!
Really?
Nirvana has six leg-looking things, right?
They're actually more like pipes that suck up magic energy from the earth itself.
The lacrima that regulate that absorption are located where the 6 legs join the main body.
If you destroy those 6 lacrima in different locations at the same time,
Nirvana will be completely deactivated.
One at a time won't work.
The other lacrima will regenerate the one that was destroyed.
Destroy six lacrima in different places simultaneously?
But how?
I'd like to coordinate the timing...
But I don't think I can keep the telepathy up that long.
I've uploaded the timing to your brains.
20 minutes?
Nirvana is almost ready to fire again.
Six lacrima...
I just know you all can do it!
I believe in you!
Impossible!
Who is that?
That voice...
It's the guy called Brain!
He's jacked my telepathy?
I am Zero!
Zero... The Master of Oracion Seis!
Oracian Seis's master?
First, let me praise you.
I never thought there would be someone who could use Archive like Brain.
I see. So he knew about Nirvana because of his Archive.
Listen well, wizards of the light!
Starting now, I will destroy everything!
As a start, I have destroyed three of your friends.
A Dragon Slayer...
An Ice Creation Wizard...
A Celestial Spirit Wizard!
And maybe some cat, too...
Natsu and the others are...
That's got to be a lie!
I believe you said something about destroying the lacrima at the same time?
Right now, I am standing in front of one of those six lacrima!
As long as I am here, destroying all six at the same time is impossible!
Zero has cut off his transmission...
If we are going to destroy all six at the same time,
then we have no choice but to split up and each head to a different place.
The chances of encountering Zero are 1 in 6.
And what's more, unless it's you, Erza, there's no chance of winning against him.
Wait a second! What are you even saying?
We don't have six people!
We don't have six wizards that could destroy the lacrima!
I'm sorry!
We have two here.
Is there no one else that can move?
My honey...
Am I not still here?
Although I am tied up...
Ichiya-san!
That makes... three.
Uh-oh! My magic power is... My telepathy is going to run out...
We need three more! Someone answer me!
Is there no one else?
Look! Christina is...
It's losing altitude!
Damn it... I've run out of magic...
Pathetic...
I'm... sorry.
Sherry!
Christina is crashing!
Gray...
Stand up...
You're a proud disciple of Ul!
You aren't going to lose to the likes of them!
Lucy... I... really hate you.
Just'cause you're a little cute, you think you're all that.
Even though you're stupid and clumsy and a weakling...
But how can I hate you if you die?
It wouldn't feel right... So answer me!
Natsu-san...
He-cat...
Natsu...
Can you hear our voices?
We... can... hear you...!
Natsu-kun...
We'll destroy... all six... lacrima at once...
Men...
And a lucky one gets to fight Zero on the way, right?
There's only 18 minutes left... We have to hurry.
We're gonna protect Carla and Wendy's guild!
My telepathy is going to run out soon.
You should have a map in your brains that I sent you.
I numbered each of the lacrima.
Decide on which one of you goes...
Sherry... You try too hard.
One!
Two!
I'll go to three!
I just hope Zero's not there!
I will head to four.
My parfum tells me that it is the closest one to me.
The map is what told you.
Was it really necessary to correct me?
I'll take five.
Erza! You doing okay?
Yeah... Thanks to her.
Then, I'll...
You're six.
Was there someone else?
Who was that just now?
Natsu doesn't know about your circumstances yet.
He thinks you're an enemy. Don't speak.
Hey!
The telepathy cut off...
He was at his limit...
That makes six.
We have to hurry!
Anyway, it sounds like we have six people.
Let's go! Whoever runs into Zero is responsible for defeating him!
Everyone has their own place to go, so there's no backup!
Men! Men! Men! Men!
Four! I am going to four!
Everyone is counting on me!
I cannot betray that trust, no matter what!
I don't have time to catch my breath!
I am still young! Men! Men!
Still alive, are we?
What'd you come here for, you little brat?
Will it be you who breaks, or me?
Let's find out!
I think Zero is at number one.
Where Natsu-san is going!
He has a good nose.
He chose one for that reason.
Then let's go and give him backup!
If we all fight together, then...
Don't underestimate Natsu.
Leave everything to him and we'll be fine.
Na...tsu...?
We need to head to our destination!
I'm five. You're six, Jellal.
Jellal...
No... It's nothing...
Natsu Dragneel...
You move better than you did before...
Dark Capriccio!
Don't think I'm on the same level as Brain.
Which one of us will break, you say?
It'll be you, obviously!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
You're able to stop piercing magic... Interesting.
Who is it?
Jellal!
Did your memories return?
We know how to stop Nirvana, so it's time to cut loose!
Aye!
But everyone's all beat up...
Nobody has the energy to cut loose anymore...
That's where spirit kicks in!
Yeah! I'm all fired up!
Just this one time, I'm jealous of your simplicity, Natsu.
Next time: The Power of Memories!
Don't you want to show Carla how cool you can be?
I'm gettin' fired up!
Now who's the simple-minded one?
