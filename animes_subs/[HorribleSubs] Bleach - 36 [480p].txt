Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Dammit! This sure is a long staircase!
How many steps are there anyway?!
Quit griping, will you?!
All right, we made it!
No ones around! Security's lax here, too.
Okay, we're going straight through to the inner area.
Seireitei Squad Five Station
In-Station Special Detention Cell
Captain
You look awful.
Rangiku
Have you calmed down a bit?
Umm
Im so sorry.
Ive caused you trouble as well.
Huh? Oh Never mind me, I wasnt able to do anything.
Umm
How are things outside?
Its chaotic.
Something such as this occurring within the station
Its unheard of. Theres still the situation with the Ryoka.
Everyones doing their own thing, completely losing focus.
Then, what about arresting the perpetrator?
They still havent finished investigating the crime scene.
We have no choice but to await the General Captains decision.
But But the one who killed the Captain
Stop it!
Dont say such a reckless thing!
I know I just said that everything was chaotic.
But Squad 5 is the one suffering the most right now.
Theyve lost both their Captain and Lieutenant at the same time.
You know what that means.
Its not that I dont understand how you feel.
However
At that time
At the time you found Captain Aizen, the actions you took
Was there no other option, was that truly what had to be done?
Couldnt you at least consider that?
The title of the Lieutenant shouldnt be taken so lightly.
Im so sorry.
Here.
This was in Captain Aizens room.
Its addressed to you.
Captain Aizen for me?
Youre lucky it was our captain who found it.
If it were anyone else,
it probably would have been submitted as evidence.
It may never have reached you.
I dont know whats written inside, but
Having your captain leave his final words to you,
that ought to be a happy thing for a Lieutenant.
Appreciate it as you read it.
Oh, thank you very much.
Hinamori, if youre reading this letter, then I must not have made it back.
The Captain
He knew he was being targeted.
Last night, after I fell asleep he wrote this letter.
Captain
Ive caused you a lot of worry.
For that, all the words of apology would never suffice.
Until now, I have never spoken to you
about the apprehension I have felt.
However, I want you to understand that it was only because
I did not wish to get you involved in this.
Please, if possible, forgive me.
For after all this, I still got you involved.
I am probably no longer with the living.
Therefore, to you, in whom I have utmost trust,
I leave this record of the truths which I have uncovered.
This is!
Wha-!
What is this, this outrageous Spiritual Pressure?!
Crap!
Lets run for it!
I dont know whats up,
but Im sure there's someone terrible around the corner!
Before the enemy finds us, weve got to run and get ahead!
Yeah!
Y-Yes
Lets go!
Hes finally here. I was getting tired of waiting.
Lets see.
Somethings wrong. Whats going on?
Weve been running and running and yet,
I dont feel any distance between us and the enemy.
My legs feel heavy.
Damn, Im running, I know Im running
This Spiritual Pressure
Its like I have a knife pressed against my throat the whole time
Huh, hey! What are you doing?!
I-Im sorry. Theres no strength in my body.
I swear you sure are a handful.
Are you all right?
Shut up! Never mind, run!
Three of them, huh? Which one is it?
Not that one
Not that one
Are you the one?
Whats the matter?
How long are you going to keep looking over there?
Eh?
Wh-What the heck?
Whats the matter?
How long are you going to keep looking over there?
Eh?
Wh-What the heck?
Im sure I was stabbed.
The intent to kill? Could just the killing intent do that?
Youre Ichigo Kurosaki, right?
How do you know my name? Who are you?
What? Havent you heard from Ikkaku?
Heard from Ikkaku?
Wait a minute
Let me ask you one thing.
What?
Among your group, who is the strongest?
Thatd probably be me.
I see.
Then you had better watch out for my captain.
He has no interest in weaklings,
but if what you said is true, then you will surely be targeted by him.
Is he strong?
Youll find out just how strong when you meet him.
That is, if you survive long enough
to even comprehend just how powerful he is.
Whats his name?
Im Kenpachi Zaraki, captain of Squad 11.
Im here to fight you to the death.
I felt Spiritual Pressure again.
To feel it through the Sekki-Seki walls of this tower
What is going on outside?
Let me tell you about one unconfirmed report.
You know about the Ryoka that entered the Soul Society yesterday, right?
There were five.
Allegedly, one of them is an orange-haired Soul Reaper
wielding a body-length sword.
Ichigo Is it really you?
If youre still alive I couldnt wish for anything more.
Run away. Runand forget about me.
In this world, there are forces which defy the logic of the living world.
Run, run away. So that you may live
So this is him.
So this is Kenpachi Zaraki, Captain of Squad 11.
Should you encounter a captain, dont hesitate and get away!
The Spiritual Pressure Ive been sensing until now was his.
How do I get away from that?!
Whats the matter?
I said, Im here to fight you to the death.
Since you havent replied, shall I start?
Ganju! Hanataro!
Hana! Hey! Are you okay
You idiot, Ichigo!
Ganju!
Hanataro and I caught a bit of that Spiritual Pressure.
Dont worry.
Never mind us, you just face whats in front of you.
Or hell take you out before you know it!
Wow!
Look at that drool!
He must have been really scared of Kenny, poor thing!
Oopsey
He got mad at me.
Stupid. Its your fault.
What is she? Whered she come from?!
Why?
How come she's totally unaffected?
Stupid is as stupid says.
Is that so?
Hey, you twerp!
Yeah?
What the heck are you?
Im Yachiru Kusajishi. Lieutenant of Squad 11.
Pleased to meet you!
Lieutenant?! Shes the same rank as Renji?
But
Just now, I didnt even notice her until she landed on me.
Shes no ordinary one either.
Ganju!
Yeah!
Take Hanataro and go on ahead!
Ill manage somehow. Take care of Rukia!
What are you saying?
Ganju!
Please
Damn
My my, they went away.
Sorry, but I cant let you pass through here.
You dont get it, do you?
What?!
Dont make me repeat myself.
Ive been waiting here just to duke it out with you.
Your friends or that Kuchiki whats-her-name
Whether they drop dead is no concern of mine
Is that so?
Hey, not bad.
Though your stance is rigid and full of gaps.
Your Spiritual Pressure is something else.
Your run-of-the-mill lieutenants would be no match.
No wonder Ikkaku lost.
But, youre still not up to par with me.
How about it? Ill give you a handicap.
What?
Ill let you take the first swing.
You can cut me up anywhere you like.
Wha-?!
Awesome! Kenny, youre so generous!
Arent I? Im literally a bleeding heart of generosity!
Stop messing with me!
What the heck are you saying?
You think I can attack someone who hasnt drawn their weapon?
Are you mocking me?
Im not mocking you. Its just a freebie.
Its admirable that you dont want to attack someone who hasnt drawn,
but you better save that nicety for another occasion.
Dont be so uptight. Lets have some fun.
To kill or to be killed
Its just another way to kill some time.
So, come on.
You can go for my neck, my gut, my eyeball
If you want, you can even kill me with this attack.
Stop quivering!
Come!
Ichigo
No, Ichigo!
Youre in danger, run!
Idiot, quit squirming!
Are you a moron?
Its dangerous to move all of a sudden!
W-Where are we? Wheres Ichigo?
Were on our way to the Shishinro.
Ichigostayed behind with them.
Stayed behind?! By himself?!
He cant! He has to get way!
I have to go back and help!
Huh? Hey Hana, calm down.
Its impossible! Theres no way he can defeat him
Even Ichigo will be killed!
Hana, you know that pokey-headed guy?
He is
He is the Squad 11 Captain, Kenpachi Zaraki.
The name Kenpachi” is passed down through the generations
to the one among the 13 Court Guard Squads
who most loves fighting and most loves killing.
The name means,
no matter how many times hes killed, he will never go down.
Its beyond the realm of being strong or weak.
He cannot die. Hes immortal!
If Ichigo fights him, he will surely be killed.
I see
After hearing that, Im even more sure we cant go back.
Ganju!
Listen up!
That guy Ichigo asked us
Ichigo asked us to take care of Rukia Kuchiki.
We all felt that Spiritual Pressure.
Ichigo and I both know that that wire-headed freak isnt normal.
So Ichigo made up his mind
to stay back and fight, so that we can go ahead.
And that was because more than anything,
Ichigo was determined to make saving this Kuchiki person the priority!
Do you understand, Hanataro?
Weve been entrusted to carry out that determination!
Ganju
We cant be dawdling here!
If you get it, then lets go!
Y-Yes!
Ichigo
After weve saved this Rukia, well surely come back for you
And when we do,
lets all go back to the Rukongai together.
I still have a ton of things to tell you.
So Ichigo, until then, dont you dare die!
Youve got to be kidding
I know I swung with my full force.
Why is it that theres not even a scratch on him?
Why is it that my hands split instead?
This
What? Hey
Is that it?
Im so disappointed.
What was that? What did he just do?
He touched the Zangetsus blade with his bare hands! Thats crazy!
Its useless, Ichy!
You cant cut Kenny.
Because to Kenny,
this thing is the same as not having a blade at all.
What?
Want me to tell you? Why your sword cant cut me?
Its nothing, really.
When two Spiritual Pressures collide, the one thats pushed down gets hurt.
Thats all there is to it.
In essence
compared to that sword you honed with your spirit pressure
in order to slay your enemies
the Spiritual Pressure that unconsciously oozes out of me is much stronger.
Thats all there is to it.
I swear
I cant believe I spent days looking for a guy at this level.
Even as a joke, its not very funny.
Now its my turn.
At least, let me get the rust off of this thing, wont you?
Im counting on you, Ryoka.
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll always stay close to you
Now and forever
Nanao! Its finally our big turn.
Nanao, where are you?
Chad, you're gonna fight that old man?
Oh, where are you hiding?
Hmmit seems so.
Are you sure about that?
Na-na-o!
