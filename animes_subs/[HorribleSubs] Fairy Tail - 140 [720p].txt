Them!
Oracion Seis!
Right?
Don't they seem really different?
It looks like the members are different, too...
Hey, three in a row!
Oracion Seis-Oracion Seis-Oracion Seis
It really is Oracion Seis!
No, no, no, no!
The reborn Oracion Seis! I'm very glad to make your acquaintance!
Reborn Oracion Seis?!
That's right. Yes, indeed.
We're the reborn Oracion Seis.
Are you Midnight?!
That name belongs to the distant past.
Please remember me henceforth as Brain II.
What are you talkin' about, the second?! You bastards just come strollin' in...
What do you want?!
I have just one wish.
To carry out my father's will.
To destroy everything that has a form...
You're still talking that nonsense?!
Legion, Fairy Tail...
Your mission is now over.
Oracion Seis
What the devil is that?!
Dan! Don't let them get it!
Alright! Understood!
You gotta be kiddin'! That's our line!
Stay out of the way!
The Reborn Oracion Seis Appears!
The maggots are swarming.
I'll knock that right back to you!
That shield didn't repel it?!
Lucy-rin, I can't believe it!
Don't cling to me in the middle of the confusion!
Back off!
What?!
To me, all forms of magic...
What happened to his magic nullifying?!
What was that...?
It refracted the range of Byro-san's magic and attacked simultaneously!
That's why he's called Brain-sama!
Carla! Do you feel it?!
Yes. Extraordinary, menacing magic power...
Ownership of the Infinity Clock is determined by the wizard
that carves his seal upon it.
Therefore, just now,
this clock has become our property.
What a pleasant sound...
Hey! Suddenly coming out of nowhere and snatching it away is cowardly!
I can hear your indignation...
You're all in a state of confusion.
It's laughable.
People of the darkness like us aren't even permitted to touch this clock.
So that's why we gathered you!
It was our plot!
Y-You...
We were used...
I don't believe it...
Then why on earth...
A chill just ran up my spine! These guys are scary!
The magic I'm feeling coming off of them...
It's in a different league than what they had before.
Who gives a damn?!
You danced in the palm of our hand...
Think of it as an honor.
Shut the hell up!
Natsu's fire was dispersed!
That's...
Wind... Nothing as gentle as that.
It's a storm. A storm is coming.
Hey, that face, that voice... Could it be...
You're...
You saw right through him! This man was formerly in Eisenwald!
He is most definitely... Erigor-sama!
My name is Grim Reaper.
Erigor?!
Him?!
You... that form...
People sure do change, don't they?
Whatever! Come down here so I can beat the crap outta you!
Brain, how long are we going to waste time here?
We have a grand aim, don't we?
I know.
But there's Fairy Tail...
I can't forget the humiliation from seven years ago.
Play with them a bit. Cobra, Racer...
Yes.
They're coming!
Engage!
Yeah!
What was that just now?! I couldn't see anything!
Dammit! What the hell is that?!
It's like another person altogether, in both speed and power!
What happened to his Slow Magic?!
I don't think he's using it here!
He's like a beast... A wild animal that's after its prey!
Yo.
It's been a long time, shrine maiden of the sky... and cat.
There's something I want to ask you...
What, you don't know the answer?
Then begone!
I can't move!
What is this overpowering feeling?!
Wait, Cobra!
Your opponent is me!!
Enough...
As always, your voice is abrasive!
Are you okay, Michelle?!
I'll live...
What was that?!
The sound became an incredible wall of pressure!
Dammit! Cobra... You bastard...
I can hear your despair...
Be destroyed by your own voice.
Coco, hurry down the escape route with Byro-sama!
But I...
This is no time to nitpick!
Look at how strong they are...
The outcome is as obvious as vinegar melting papyrus!
Slow...
A gale force wind from the fore... becomes a tornado.
What are you going to do?!
There's still something that I can do!
Since I was born a man, there's still something I can do, even if it puts my life at risk!
You people!
You have something that doesn't rightfully belong to you!
Even if there's a difference in our strengths,
I won't take even one step back!
Dan!
He can be a decent person too, huh?
I'm not sure...
Even though it's pointless... Dull-witted fellow!
Hey! Are you listening to me?!
You're... You're...
You're my Rosslyn!
What's that?!
What's your name?
Angel. And I hate men who act too familiar.
Lightning bonus!
Love at first sight?
He'll never be popular.
It made my whole body shudder. Definitely a presentiment of romance.
No, I'm the one that zapped you.
The difference in power between us is obvious.
Wasting time...
Fairy Tail is weak.
Let's get going.
Angel, get rid of them.
Understood.
The cost is 30...
She's Angel! The Celestial Wizard, Angel!
I suspected as much, though it seems like she's got an odd personality!
Maiden who walks with the Celestial Spirits...
I was a child then.
But now, as my name implies, I'm an angel!
You think that Spirits can stand up against an angel?
I'll show you some beautiful Angel Magic.
But before that, people will grovel before me, despair...
Look at the power that comes from the light in my own name!
I summon the angel that calls forth victory... Barakiel!
Protect the seal and seal away this burial ground!
That's...
No! What the blazes is goin' on here?!
Oh, no. My bad feeling turned out to be right.
You were right? Wait...
Is this the result you predicted, Samuel?
My calculations were off-base... not.
I only made it look like my calculations were wrong.
I have no idea what you're saying.
What do you mean?
Don't you feel it?
The presence of evil, like you've never felt before...
Where are Byro-sama, Dan, and Coco?
What happened?!
Oracion Seis? How?!
They should still be imprisoned!
What's going on here?!
So... who else is at the site?
Actually...
The Fairy Tail wizards, for example...
Fairy Tail again?!
However, ever since that guild got a new master,
I don't believe they've caused any major trouble!
Didn't you know?
Makarov Dreyar has returned.
That's what I've heard, too.
The moment he's back, this happens...
Org, what's funny?
Nothing. I thought this is just like him...
It's nothing to laugh about.
The captain of the Detention Corps is here.
Yes. Good timing. Let him in.
Captain Lahar of the 4th Enforcement and Detention Corps, at your service.
We've been waiting for you. Speak.
Yes, sir. I shall make my report.
Judging by your expression,
the Oracion Seis that appeared in the desert is the genuine article.
I am astonished at your discerning eyes, Chairman.
I see...
I regret to report
that those who should be in prison,
namely, Midnight, Cobra, Angel, and Racer, four of Oracion Seis,
along with the one they later acted with,
formerly of Eisenwald, Erigor...
Simulacra made from magic were in each of their cells.
First him, then the Six Generals...
Simulation Magic?
Though magic shouldn't have worked in any of the cells...
We think they were helped by someone.
They were imprisoned for seven years.
Was there someone who had contact with Oracion Seis?
Yes, sir. Just one person.
A priest sent over by the archbishop of Zentopia.
He came to visit them at certain set times to take their confessions
and help them atone for their sins.
Who is that priest?
There's no record of him.
Impossible.
And even if there is no record, there must be surveillance lacrima, yes?
There must still be footage of the priest.
The other day, all of the surveillance lacrima in the prison were switched out at the same time,
so everything related to this was disposed of.
Follow the disposal route.
Find the footage and verify the person's identity.
And Zentopia should be paid a visit.
I shall meet with the archbishop.
At the moment, our only clue is that priest. Tread carefully.
Yes, sir.
Men!
Natsu! You regained consciousness?!
Huh? Where are we?
Blue Pegasus!
Blue Pegasus?!
Did you remember my parfum?
You saved me? Where's everyone else?
Worry not.
They're all just sleeping.
No one is seriously injured, so we're letting them rest up a bit. Men!
I see...
Oh, my! Natsu-kun is up, too?!
Natsu!
Jeez! How long were you gonna sleep?!
You better give your thanks to them, too!
This is incredible, you know?
Ichiya-san is the one who saved us from under all that wreckage.
Oh, really? Thanks.
We're comrades who fought together. I need no thanks.
There are so many good men here!
Such a waste for them to mix it up with the women.
Now that you mention it...
I was looking after you, Gray-chan.
Don't call me chan!
I'm grateful, Master Bob.
You lied down next to him, too, right?
Don't tell me that!
What happened to the glittery guys?
Hibiki and the others are in another land for a different matter. Men!
Where's Leon?
Ichiya dropped him off at Lamia Scale.
And Legion?
I didn't see anyone there but you folks.
I see...
What's wrong?
Those bastards... Dammit...
They were toying with us...
Next time, we're gonna kick their asses!
I have also heard of Oracion Seis's resurrection.
You have my support.
I know I can rely on you.
Huh? Where's Michelle?
She said she was going out to get some fresh air a little while ago.
It's my fault...
I brought you that clock hand...
It's not your fault, Michelle!
But so many people have gotten hurt...
Uh-uh.
I'm sure we'll solve the problem. You'll see!
Besides, even if
the only good thing was being able to meet you, I'm happy.
Don't blame yourself! Got it?
Yes. Thank you.
Nee-san... I love you.
Father... Why did you entrust that clock hand to me?
I don't know what you were thinking.
The same thing with Key of the Starry Heavens... What did you want to tell me?
I said... not to, but...
What's wrong?
Maybe...
I'm going to try reading Key of the Starry Heavens one more time!
I want to try thinking one more time about what Father tried to tell me!
Why do you hate this book?
I don't know.
Everyone's making a mistake.
Tell us, Asuka. What do you mean, they're making a mistake?
Well, they shouldn't collect the pieces!
You're talking about the clock!
That's right! It says right there in the book!
I see... We were wrong.
What did you say?
I understand. Now I understand!
It meant we mustn't collect them!
What?!
What do you mean?
I'm telling you!
We weren't supposed to collect them!
That's what the message in this book meant!
The pieces of the clock...
We weren't supposed to get them!
Then... don't tell me we...
Is that what Angel was talking about?
They were waiting for us to gather them?
So it seems...
That image was a warning.
I tried to figure it out and got cocky...
I'm sorry!
Everyone...
Father...
I'm sorry!
It sounds like the outcome was truly bitter.
Too bitter! I just know that something bad is going to happen!
After all...
Well, your dad did beat around the bush...
Yeah, right? He was roundabout with that anagram or whatever...
At least it was too difficult for someone I know...
All he had to do was tell us not to collect them!
There are some people who get a fever from thinking about something too much.
Maybe my magic powers up with that fever!
Then let's give each other riddles!
Alright! Now I'm fired up!
Huh? Is Lucy-san laughing?
Well, after all, you're all weird!
What would be the point in brooding?
Like they say, Fortune comes in by a merry gate.
Yeah, right?!
Are you all trying to cheer me up?
You really think that's likely?
At this rate, it'll probably rain tomorrow, too.
What's that?! You lookin' for a fight?!
See, you were tryin' to cheer her up!
If you're going to fight, take it outside!
But don't fight, for my sake!
It ain't for your sake!
This is the Fairy Tail I know and love...
Everyone makes mistakes. But then you recover.
Look at all of the friends you have here who adore you.
It would be difficult for anything to change that.
If you keep that in mind, you should be able to get back on your feet any number of times.
Right.
Please let me enter, Your Holiness.
I have urgent news that must reach the archbishop's ears!
I'm afraid that I cannot let even you in, Duke Byro.
Right now, the only person who may have an audience with the archbishop is me, Rapowant.
I shall pass along your message.
Every second counts!
The Infinity Clock was stolen by Oracion Seis!
They're going to...
I am well aware of that already.
Don't lose your head.
How does he already know?
Surprise!
Cardinal Rapowant...
I don't like his type. For one thing, you never know what he's thinking.
It seems the archbishop plucked him, an influential person, from the local parish,
but I just can't bring myself to trust him.
What did His Grace say in response?!
He gave Legion a new duty.
Princess! I'm scared!
Coco... You betrayed Legion.
Your Holiness!
Apparently, you turned your back on the faith while a member of Legion.
Are you prepared to face the consequences?
You can do what you want.
I have no regrets!
That sound...!
The Infinity Clock!
It's ringin' out from somewhere!
I wonder what the infinity part of the Infinity Clock is...
If we knew that, we wouldn't have come this far lookin' for it!
I think it's fish!
It's not fish, it's a clock!
That's not what I mean. When the doors open, there's fish inside
and no matter how many you take out, there are more in there, so it's an Infinity Fish Clock!
When did it become a fish clock?!
Next time: Hunt Down the Infinity Clock!
Then what do you think it is, Natsu?
Inside the clock is another clock and so on and so on!
That part's infinite?!
