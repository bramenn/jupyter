That's right. I declare to the Pokemon of the world,
I will be the greatest Pokemon trainer,
the greatest Pokemon Master of all time.
Last time, Ash, our hero from Pallet, chose Pikachu,
a Pokemon who was not too thrilled with its new trainer.
Soon they found themselves fighting off a flock of fearsome Spearows.
Pikachu saved the day with its amazing Thunder Shock,
but the electrifying encounter left Pikachu weak
and his fate in Ash's hands.
-Pikachu. -
-We beat'em. -Chu...?
POKEMON EMERGENCY!
Attention, citizens of Viridian City.
Attention, citizens of Viridian City.
We have reports of possible Pokemon thieves in our area.
Be on the lookout for suspicious looking strangers.
Repeat, be on the lookout for suspicious looking... Huh?
Speak of the devil.
Hold it. And just where do you think you're going with that Pokemon, young man?
It's my Pokemon and its hurt
and I've got to get it to the hospital right away.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you might be stealing it.
Just show me your I.D. and you can go.
You see, we just came here from Pallet and we-
You know, you're the fourth person I've seen today from Pallet town.
The fourth. Oh, that means Gary Oak is here already.
It's very unusual for someone to carry a Pokemon around in his arms
and not in a Poke Ball.
How do I know you didn't steal that Pokemon,
especially since you don't have any identification?
Please let me through. I wouldn't steal a Pokemon
and I've got to get Pikachu to the hospital. Please, miss.
Hey, what's that in your pocket?
What? Oh, this?
This, this is perfect.
A Pokedex!
-This will solve our problem. -Huh?
Let's see. If you're the real deal.
I'm Dexter, a Pokedex programmed by Professor Oak
for Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum of the town of Pallet.
My function is to provide Ash with information
and advice regarding Pokemon and their training.
If lost or stolen, I cannot be replaced.
Oh, my Pokedex.
I didn't realize it was also my I.D.
Can I take Pikachu to the Pokemon Center now?
I'll get you there in no time at all.
Sit back, hold on and don't yell.
-Whoa!
Hey, what's the big idea? Ugh, come back here.
WANTED
A wanted poster. How flattering.
Flattering? This picture makes me look terrible.
Then you should be happy the photographer captured the real you.
Exactly.
We'll show these bumpkins.
The people of Viridian City will be sorry they ever saw this face.
We're all sorry to see your face. Stay focused.
We're here to capture rare and unusual Pokemon.
Don't forget. Meowth!
-Absolutely. -But of course.
And just remember, I'm the top cat.
- You got it. - Meowth!
There it is.
Pokemon Center. It's gigantic.
This is tricky. Just hold on. Here we go.
Whoa!
-We have a driveway, you know. -It's a Pokemon emergency.
-Please help it. -Looks like a Pikachu.
We'll do what we can.
I need a stretcher for a small electric Pokemon, stat.
Chansey.
It'll be okay. Rush this Pokemon to the critical care unit.
Chansey.
We'll begin the treatment right away.
-Uh... -Who are you?
His name is Ash. He's the Pokemon's trainer.
If there's anything I can do, please, just tell me.
-You can be more responsible. -Huh?
If you want to become a Pokemon trainer, young man,
you don't let your Pokemon battle till it's in this condition.
But you don't know what happened.
What's past is past. Now we have to heal your Pikachu.
-What can I do? -Just leave everything to me.
Please.
It's in your hands. I know you'll give the Pokemon excellent care.
-You got it here just in time. -That's my job!
Oh, my goodness. I left my motorcycle parked at the front desk.
Next time, use the driveway.
Ash, you'll have to go to the waiting room.
Can't I...
Pikachu.
I'll call home.
Ring, ring, ring! Phone call!
Ring, ring, ring, ring! Phone call, phone-
Hello, this is the Ketchum residence.
Hello, Mom? -Oh!
Oh, hi, honey. Is everything okay?
-Where are you, Ash? -The Pokemon Center in Viridian City.
You're already in Viridian City?
It took your father four days to get there when he started Pokemon training.
Oh, he'll be so proud. You're the apple of his eye.
Yeah, a rotten apple. -
Oh, Ash, don't get discouraged. You're doing fine.
Honey, you're growing up right before my eyes...
spreading your wings and soaring like a Spearow.
I feel more like a fallen Pidgey.
I won't let you talk about yourself that way.
Just be confident.
You can do anything that you set your mind to.
-Do you understand? -Yes.
And are you changing your underwear every day?
-Yes. -Okay.
Good night, son. I love you.
Me too, Mom. Bye.
Huh?
Hey. Wow.
That's the flying Pokemon I saw. Hmm.
Ring, ring, ring! Phone call!
Ring, ring, ring! Phone call! phone call!
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!
Uh, this is Ash. Who's calling?
Here I'm over here. Ash, it's Professor Oak.
Don't you recognize me?
No, Professor, I didn't recognize the back of your head.
Eh? Oops, wrong camera.
There. Ahem. I just spoke with your mother
and she tells me you've made it to the Pokemon Center in Viridian City.
Is that correct?
I couldn't be talking to you if I wasn't here.
You couldn't be talking if you- Oh, I see.
I dialed the Pokemon Center in Viridian City and you were able to answer.
Yeah, because that's where I am.
Mm hmm. I suppose that proves it.
The other new Pokemon trainers made it there with no problem
and I'm pleasantly surprised you got there so soon.
I admit, when you left, I had my doubts that you could handle your Pikachu
but when my grandson Gary said
that you wouldn't have a single new Pokemon
by the time you got to Viridian City,
I bet him a million dollars that he'd be wrong.
Well, money isn't everything, right?
Oh, why do I even bother?
But I did see a flying Pokemon like that one.
It flew right over the rainbow.
Don't talk such nonsense. You couldn't have seen this Pokemon.
Trainers have searched their whole lives and never seen it.
-It sure looked like it. -You must have been mistaken.
Ah, there's my pizza.
Coming!
It was very nice talking to you, Ash. And good luck.
Mm, anchovies, spinach and pineapple pizza.
-Huh? - Now I've got you.
I knew I'd find you here.
Hey, what happened to your bike?
What happened to my bike?
You happened to my bike, you little loser.
This is what's left after you stole it to save your Pokemon.
Now I can see why your Pokemon is in the... Whoa, whoa, ah, ah, ah!
Oh!
- -Let me help you.
I don't need your help and you're going to pay for what you did to my bike.
I'll make up for it. I promise I will, really.
But I can't do anything about your bike until-
I don't want any of your lame excuses, kid.
I just want a new bike right now!
It's my Pikachu.
-My Pikachu's not too good. -Huh?
Is it very serious?
I think so and there's nothing I can do to help now.
Oh.
Huh?
Pikachu, are you all right?
Your Pikachu's resting. It's a good thing you got it here so fast.
The procedure went well and it should be fine.
-Thanks to the Pokemon Center. -Yes, thank you very much.
Now your Pokemon needs a good rest in the recovery room.
You should go in with it, Ash. Thanks.
Listen, I'm sorry about your bike,
but I'm going to need some time to make things right.
-No way, I fell for that last time. -Huh?
Well, you should take care of Pikachu now and we'll settle up later.
Uh, okay.
Your attention, please. Our Viridian City radar sensors
have detected an aircraft belonging to a gang of Pokemon thieves.
If you have a Pokemon in your possession, exercise extreme caution.
Guess we woke up this sleepy dump.
And how dare they act like we're criminals?
Well, we'll teach them to respect that name.
Meowth. And when we snatch all their Pokemon,
those scared little mice will know I'm the top cat.
We know, Meowth. We know.
Ekans, Koffing, attack!
Koffing!
Ekans!
Koffing!
What are...? Who are they?
Don't be frightened, little boy.
Allow us to introduce ourselves.
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above...
-Jessie. -James.
Team rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Meowth! That's right.
What are you talking about?
He just doesn't get it, does he?
How can I? You don't make any sense.
We're here for the Pokemon.
You're not getting Pikachu!
Pikachu? We're not interested in your precious electric rat.
We seek only rare and valuable Pokemon.
You're wasting your time.
This is a center for weak and injured Pokemon.
Well, that may be so, but I wouldn't be at all surprised
if we find a few little Pokemon gems among all the junk.
You're starting to bug me.
-Isn't that cute? -the boy's bugged.
Meowth. Then let's squash him.
- Koffing, attack! - Ekans, go!
Koffing!
-Koffing! -Ekans!
Hey, the lights. They must've cut the power.
But we've got our own pika power source.
Pika, pika, chu, chu.
Oh, look at all the Pikachu.
Pika, pika, chu, chu!
A crisis situation has arisen.
Initiating emergency Poke Ball transport sequence.
We have to save those Poke Balls.
This is the Viridian City Pokemon Center. We have an emergency situation.
Transporting Poke Balls.
This is the Pewter City Pokemon Center. Downloader activated.
Ready to receive Poke Balls.
Koffing!
- Oh! -Get those Poke Balls!
Uh, right!
This is war. Don't just hold them. Throw them!
All right. Poke Ball, here we go. Ah!
-Pidgey. Aah! -Ekans!
That thing can't beat us.
No? Well, try this one. Poke Ball, here we go. Aah!
Empty?
-We're never going to beat them that way. -Some of the Poke Balls are empty.
Well, now she tells me.
This one feels like a real winner. Poke Ball, go. Aah!
Rattata!
-Heh, pipsqueak. -Meowth!
-Ekans! -Rattata!
I guess I'm going to have to take this into my own hands.
You grab Pikachu and get out of here.
I'll take care of these three clowns.
That's pretty big talk coming from such a little lady.
At least you're right about the pretty part.
Thanks for the compliment.
The girl thinks she's pretty.
I agree with her. I think she's pretty too. Pretty pathetic.
I'll show you.
Poke Ball, go!
Goldeen, goldeen, goldeen, goldeen, goldeen, goldeen...
Huh?
Goldeen, return.
Goldeen, goldeen, goldeen.
-That's her best shot? -She's all washed up.
You know as well as I do that a water Pokemon can't battle on land.
-I was just warming up. -Warming up?
-Just get Pikachu out of here. -Right.
-Koffing! -Ekans!
-Koffing! -Ekans!
-Pika, pika! - Pikachu!
Pikachu!
-Pikachu! -Pikachu!
Do I have to do everything? That mouse is cat food. Meowth!
Just wait. Pikachu, you're mine.
- -Pika, pika, pika, pika.
-Pika, pika? -Pika.
-Pika, pika power? -Pika!
So you want... You want more power.
What's this?
Well, let's just say that Pikachu and I...
are going to generate a little excitement for you, Meowth.
-Huh? -Uh-oh.
Meowth?
Pika, pika. Pikachu!
Too late. But not for the fireworks.
Great, a cat losing to a mouse.
That Pikachu is no ordinary Pikachu.
It's certainly very rare, a perfect prize.
-Let's catch it. -Perhaps we will.
Your Viridian City Pokemon were transported here safely.
Thanks, sis.
Ash, Misty and Pikachu are heading your way, to Pewter City...
if they can get safely through the Viridian Forest.
Don't worry, from what I've seen,
those three can take pretty good care of themselves.
Well, I hope you're right.
-What's the matter? -Look, over there.
Oh, cool, it's a Caterpie. It's one of the bug Pokemon.
Even if it is a Pokemon, bugs are disgusting and I don't like them.
-Do something. -All right, stand back.
This one's a piece of cake.
Poke Ball, go.
Will Ash capture the Caterpie?
What sinister plans are being concocted by Team Rocket?
Will Misty ever get a new bicycle?
All the answers on the next Pokemon.
