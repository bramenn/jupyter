Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
W-What is this?!
It's huge!
Ill shoot you guys into the Seireitei with this.
From the sky.
Sky?!
Sky?!
My name is Kukaku Shiba.
I'm the best pyrotechnic in Rukon District!
Pyrotechnic?
Right!
Koganehiko! Shiroganehiko!
Raise it!
Y-Y-Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Huh?!
What is that?!
What's happening?
The floor
is rising!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
The ceiling isopening!
Is this for real?!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes...!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes...!
Are you kids scared?
This is the special Kukaku Shiba Super-sized Fireworks Stage.
The Flower-Crane Cannon!
Don't say it before I do!
I-I'm sorry
What, speechless?
What kind of joke is this?!
You may be a fireworks expert or whatever,
but as if you could shoot us over with that-!
What is this?
The Reishu-kaku, Spirit Core.
Place your palms on it and focus your spiritual energy!
Huh? Like this?
How do you focus your spiritual energy?
Huh? What are you saying?
Like this!
If you're a Soul Reaper,
surely you know how to use your Kido.
Actually
Huh?!
This boy is the newbie Soul Reaper I told you about earlier.
He can't use Kido at all.
What?!
Like this?
Geez! How hopeless! Ganju, show him!
Yes!
Hey, give it here!
Why you-!
Kid! Wanna fight?!
Yeah Take it if you can.
I'd rather die than be shown by you!
Cut it out!
Sorry
Sorry
Huh?
W-What's that?!
This is the Cannonball.
Cannonball?
Now listen up.
You think that the only thing guarding the Seireitei is that barrier,
but you're wrong.
That barrier is made from an ore known as SekkiSeki
that is rare even in Soul Society.
This is a fragment of it.
As you can see,
it completely breaks down spiritual energy.
That's why it's impossible
to bore a hole through the barrier with spiritual energy.
On top of that
even when cut,
it emits a wave that breaks down spiritual energy from all sides.
Which means...that the Seireitai has a spherical barrier around it
from the sky to the underground.
And sothats where this comes in!
S-SisI'm tired-
Deal with it!
This is the Special Hard Spiritual Partition Penetration Device that I invented.
In other words,
if all of you combined put your spiritual energy into this Spirit Core,
you can create a temporary cannonball that will break through the barrier.
And then
I'll shoot that cannonball with the Flower-Crane Cannon
and it'll pierce straight through the barrier.
Any questions?
Errwell
All right, you are dismissed!
Go to the underground training room
and practice concentrating your spiritual energy!
Yes, yes!
Yes, yes!
Take them!
Yes!
Yes!
Let me go!
What the hell?!
Don't touch me! Leggo!
Put me down!
Listen, if any one of you loses concentration,
you'll blow up right there!
What?!
You all need practice!
Practice hard!
Hey, you never mentioned that!
Hey, good job.
S-Sis
Go down below and help them practice.
Hey, Sis
Are you really gonna help them?
What do you mean?
I'm against it! Helping a Soul Reaper!
What'll I say to Brother?!
Sis, I
Ganju!
I told you Don't ever speak of it again!
Sis
If you understand, go!
Listen
Never show such a weak face in front of them!
This is the first time
I've had to wear the Lieutenant badge.
Of course it is!
Its the first time I've been ordered to wear it like this!
Lieutenants are to put on their badges
and wait in the aids room 2.
This is getting interesting.
Abarai Iba
Hinamori. No one else showed up yet?
Yes, I think so.
Lieutenants are scattered all over Soul Society working diligently.
It might take about half a day for everyone to gather.
My Captain can't be reached at all. What a pain.
Huh? Who is your squad captain again?
You know, the Hitsugaya boy.
Oh, that little prodigy. Thats tough.
Abarai
Huh?
Have you seen our Captain Aizen?
N-No, I haven't.
He's been acting strange lately.
Even this morning.
But he won't answer when I ask him if anything's wrong.
I don't know what to do.
Don't worry.
Huh?
Nothing's the matter.
Even this summons will probably be cancelled soon.
Dammit!
In your view, should she die?
What is it? Just what the hell is going on, Captain Aizen?!
Training Room  No! That's wrong, Ichigo!
It's not wohhh.
It's nuahh!
Nuohh!
No, no! Nuahh!
Nuohh!
No!
Kurosaki
It's nuahhh?
Nuahhh.
Nuahhh!
I dont understand! Explain it better!
Sorry, Brother.
I've decided to help that Soul Reaper,
like the one who killed you.
If you were alive,
and saw me not helping them, you'd scold me, wouldn't you?
Youwho loved Soul Reapers and died as a Soul Reaper.
Now, please Orihime.
Oh! You're doing just fine!
Ishida!
It's quite narrow, but the shape is there.
HmmThe shape probably reflects his personality.
Next! Chad!
Oh, this isa bit unstable, but very powerful!
And finally, Ichigo.
This is terrible!
Absolutely terrible!
What is that...
I can only conclude that you have no talent.
No talent at all!
No talent at all!
Shirogane!
I said I don't understand!
You! Teach me some useful pointers, damn it!
Uh, Brotherdinner's ready.
Huh? Hey guys! Dinner is ready!
You must be hungry.
Now that you mention it
You didn't get to eat in Rukon District, did you?
Those guys can't use spiritual energy. So they don't get hungry.
Go and eat.
But
Never mind me.
Go and eat. I'll come, after I figure this out.
Really? Okay then
Yeah.
Inoue, you're coming, too right?
Oh, I'm not hungry at all yet, so it's okay.
HehI'm lying.
I am a bit hungry Oh, how embarrassing.
Inoue.
Go. I'll be fine.
N-No I want to practice some more.
I'm really not hungry.
Inoue!
Please
All right.
Okay Since you're asking me.
I'm going then.
H-Hey Inoue!
C'mon, Ishida. Chad, too!
Dammit!
Is she that important to you?
Huh?
This Soul Reaper you're going to save.
Not really.
Huh?
Give it here!
Then did you, like, promise to save her?
No.
Then it must be money.
She promised to pay you if you saved her.
No way I can use money from here in my world!
Then why? Why are you so determined?!
I owe her!
She saved my life. And I haven't repaid her yet.
She gave me her power to save my family and me
even though she had just met me.
Because of that, she was arrested
and she's about to be executed.
I don't want to turn into a pathetic guy who'd turn his back on her.
What?
Give it to me!
Huh?!
What're you doing?! Give it back!
I'm going to practice, too!
Cover your ears! Don't you dare listen!
I'm going to review the trick I developed myself.
Huh?
Visualize this
Draw a circle in your heart
as dark as possible, and as heavy as possible.
Thenimagine yourself jumping right into the center of the circle.
This is the basic image that works for all Kido.
So easy.
It's so easy I could cry!
I didn't even have to practice it!
Sorry to bother you.
What a ham!
Such terrible acting! Idiot!
Draw a circle
in my heart
Thank you for the meal.
Yes.
Huh? Inoue, are you done?
Y-Yes, I'm full-
See? My stomach is full.
Y-You don't have to go that far.
Forget I ever asked.
ActuallyI was going to take it to Ichigo.
That's right, Kurosaki still hasn't
Oh! It's breaking apart! No! The object!
The Great Kukaku arm pillar is going to fall!
Its Kurosaki!
Let's go!
What happened?! Hey Ganju!
I-I'm sorry, Sis
I just showed him once.
I never imagined it would turn out like this!
You fool! Gather your spiritual energy together already!
I did it!
You did it, Ichigo!
Yeah!
You idiot! Don't lose your concentration!
Huh?
Weren't you listening to me, fool?!
I told you!
If you lose concentration, youll blow up!
Yes, you did.
I'll say, you
You're just as guilty, idiot!
Both of you, no food tonight!
Why?!
Why put me together with him?!
Shut up! Got a problem?!
Owee! Okay, we understand.
Okay, we understand!
You're here.
Captain of the Squad 3
Gin Ichimaru.
What's going on?
I get called so suddenly and look at this crowd?
The captains who control Soul Society are all here for me?
Maybe not.
The Captain of the Squad 13 isn't here.
Did something happen to him?
He's absent with an illness.
Again? I hope he gets better soon.
Quit joking around.
You know you weren't summoned here for that.
I understand you went and played with the Ryokas by yourself.
And I hear you failed. Explain yourself.
You should have no trouble dealing with four or five Ryokas.
Oh, they didn't die then?
What?
Oh, I thought they were dead.
My intuition has gotten dull.
You can stop that monkey business.
Theres no way that captain-level guys like us
would fail to tell instantly whether an opponent's Hakudo has ceased or not.
There they go again, stupid squabbling among old fools.
Come on! You make it sound like I let him go on purpose.
That's precisely what I'm saying.
Shut up, Kurotsuchi.
I'm talking to him now.
What did you say?
So stupid.
Oh boy tempers are running high.
Enough of this!
But I think the reason why you have been summoned
has been made clear.
Acting alone, and letting the target escape
Well? How do you defend your actions
Ichimaru?
I can't.
What?!
There's nothing I can say to defend myself.
I made a simple mistake. I won't make excuses.
I'll accept whatever punishment-
Just a minute, Ichimaru.
First, let me ask you something.
Urgent alert! Urgent alert! Intruders in Seireitei!
All Squads get into position! Repeat!
Intruders?
Those Ryokas?
It can't be
Ichigo...
With much appreciation
send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I dont know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move
hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
Youre not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
Four students and one cat into Seireitei!
Got it! I'm off, Sis!
Attention, please!
The Cannonball will be shot very soon.
Guests, take your seats now or else!
I'm really worried.
