The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Oh, yeah! Can you hear this voice?
Oh, yeah! It's hoarse from yelling.
Oh, yeah! Until your heart can hear it...
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
The moon and sun high-five.
Are you sure you're not forgetting something?
When you're not here to make me laugh,
even what I'm looking for can't be found.
Snowing, be honest with yourself and smile,
because when two people lay close, time overlaps.
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Don't say goodbye!
Last time on Fairy Tail!
I want the two of you to lend me your power.
Will you come with me?
Make a team...
We're in deep trouble!
The forbidden magic, Lullaby, was given birth by the Black Wizard Zeref long ago.
The sound of the flute is said to steal people's souls.
Currently, a battle to decide the fate of the Lullaby flute is reaching its conclusion.
Natsu!
Do you get it now, you Fairy Tail brat?
Flame can never defeat wind!
You son of a bitch...
It's almost like a typhoon...
Your flames can no longer touch me!
Eat this! Storm Shred!
Damn... you...
Break through!
It's not just my flames, but my fist can't even get close to him!
Damn it!
The Strongest Team!
What's the matter, punk? That all you got?
I thought you'd be a bit tougher.
No matter.
I'll end this now.
This is Flying Phoenix magic that will tear anything to ribbons!
Emera Baram!
Emera Baram, he said? If you get hit with that you'll be torn apart!
Scatter to the wind, you hotheaded brat!
Natsu!
Natsu, get up!
I'm impressed his body's still in one piece.
Not bad for a young wizard.
Natsu!
Worry not. The old geezers'll be following him shortly.
From the sweet sound of the lullaby...
Lullaby, this... Lullaby, that...
If you want the old men's heads then fight them fair and square!
That's my Natsu!
Impossible! He's still standing?
If you don't have the will to fight them, then lay off!
You're one stubborn brat!
Damn...
Damn it! Why can't I get close to him?!
That's...
I can't stand it!
You son of a bitch!!
The some eerie magic...
It's like his emotions are manifesting themselves as flames...
This is... Erigor's wind is flowing in a strange direction...
Flames of emotion?
It's true that there was an ancient magic like that...
No, this kid couldn't possibly...
What's this?
My wind is heading towards him!
I see!
Natsu!
Give up. You can't win. Just let Gray handle it.
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?!
He's drawing away my Storm Mail!
You bastard!
The super-heated air around Natsu moves upward extremely fast, creating an area of low pressure.
And wind blows toward areas of low pressure!
I will be the one to defeat you!
Such incredible super-heated magic!
He couldn't be...
Sword Edge of the Fire Dragon!
So a Dragon Slayer really exists?
How about that, Happy?
Right! That's Natsu, The Salamander all right!
That's not what you said a second ago.
Cats have very weak short term memory.
You said that I couldn't beat him, so Erza should do it!
His memory is even worse than a cat's.
Not Erza... Gray!
But anyway, you won Natsu!
Yup, so we're good!
I wonder why that last attack worked?
'Cause you're just that awesome, Natsu!
So that's why!
Natsu!
You guys are late! It's already over.
Aye!
As expected.
Erza, are you okay?
Don't worry about me.
I-I can't believe that Master Erigor lost...
You actually had trouble with this guy?
Trouble? It was a cinch! Easy!
It was pretty touch and go there...
And besides, you're gonna attract weirdos with your bare chested muffler look.
I don't wanna hear that from you.
Lucy, give me your clothes.
Why me?!
Anyway, splendid work, Natsu.
We've protected the Guild Masters.
Let's go to the meeting hall.
We'll report what happened and let the masters dispose of the flute.
Clover's not far from here.
Kage!
That's dangerous!
I've got the lullaby!
You let your guard down, Flies!
That bastard!
What the hell? And we saved him!
After him!
According to the report, Eisenwald is gunning for the Guild Masters' regular meeting.
We'll head there now, and round them up in one stroke!
It doesn't matter if they're wizards.
We'll show them just how scary the Fiore Army can be!
Okay. The sound of the lullaby should reach them from this distance, no problem.
Finally... Finally, the time has come...
These girlies are quite the lookers, yes!
Young wizards these days have really upped their level of looks and skills!
Photo spreads are the best...
No, no, no! I don't have time for this. I have to find out where they're head-
It's not what you think!
This is part of my studies! I don't feel the slightest bit guilty about-
You don't have to make excuses...
Oh, you're injured.
What the heck are you doing wandering around out here?
Uh, well...
Wait! Isn't this Fairy Tail's Makarov?
Fate won't let me escape from these flies, will it?
Um...
Would you listen to me play a tune?
I'm not allowed to bring instruments into the hospital, so...
I-I wanted someone to hear me!
That's one creepy flute you got there.
It might look strange, but it has a lovely tone.
I'm in a hurry. But I suppose I could listen to one song.
Okay!
I win.
Listen up, now.
Finally...
We're just getting even with all the legal guilds!
They sure got a lot of nerve for a bunch of no-talent idiots!
With this we'll lock ourselves onto the road of darkness,
and get our revenge on the people from the magical world that stole our livelihoods!
You won't get your rights back by doing something like that!
Try thinking about the future a little. All of you lot.
Kage! We need your power!
Wasn't he an ally from your own guild?!
There he is!
Master!
Gramps!
Shh!
We're just getting to the good part. Now watch!
And wow, you all are just so cute!
Totally my type!
Who the heck is this?
That's Master Bob.
Erza, sweetie, how you've grown!
This is the master of Blue Pegasus?!
What's the matter? Hurry and play it.
We can't let him!
We said, keep quiet and watch. This is the good part.
It's the master of Quatro Cerberus!
Master Goldmine!
If I just...
If I just blow, then everything'll change...
Nothing will change.
Weak humans will always be weak, no matter how long you wait.
But weakness is not always a bad thing.
Humans are weak creatures from the start.
Uneasy by ourselves, we form guilds.
Where we have allies and friends!
In order to thrive, we bind together and progress ahead.
These awkward combinations might run into more walls than would a single person...
And we might take a long time to get where we're going...
But, as long as we believe in tomorrow and place one foot in front of the other,
we will be filled with power from within.
Living a strong life means being able to smile!
And not relying on something like that flute.
I surrender!
Master!
Gramps!
Gramps!
Why are you here?
Excellent, as always!
Those words were so moving!
That's gonna bruise!
And that settles that.
Way to go, gramps!
Stop patting me!
A bunch of cowardly wizards, every last one of you!
Something's coming out!
What the heck is that?
I can't stand it anymore!
I'll devour them myself!
Your pitiful souls, that is!
That's way too big!
So that's what you complain about?!
What is this thing?
I had no idea about this!
Oh, my! How upsetting.
This is a demon of the book of Zelef.
This isn't good!
Should we help?
My back hurts, so I'll pass...
Why did the flute turn into a monster?
That monster IS the lullaby.
In other words, it's living magic.
That's Zeref's magic.
Living magic?
Zeref? Isn't he ancient history?
The Black Wizard Zeref was the most evil wizard in the history of the Magical World!
To think that a part of his legacy would appear before us after all these centuries!
So then, which one of your souls should I partake of first?
Say what?!
Are souls tasty, anyway?
How should I know? And don't ask me!
I figured that's what he'd be wondering about.
Natsu, Gray, move away from everyone!
How bossy!
Don't order me around!
I'm counting on you!
Aye, sir!
There's Happy 2 again...
The big guy's all bark and no bite! He ain't got nothing!
Charge!
Back off, small fry!
Captain, the mountain has disappeared!
What?
R-Retreat!
Okay, I've decided! I'm going to eat all of your souls, you pitiful wizards!
Sounds like fun! Go ahead and try it!
You can do it!
What do they plan to do with just the three of them?
What about you, Lucy?
I'm out of Celestial Spirits I can use today,
and I might just hold everyone back, see...
Excuses.
Shut up, cat!
What a horrid voice!
What's this terrible feeling?
It's begun...
Oh, no!
It's the lullaby!
Our souls are being devoured!
Let's go!
Right!
Requip!
The Knight!
Ice Make Lance!
Take this!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
He's punching with fire!
And this one's an ice wizard!
She's requipping armor!
You're really pissing me off now!
How about another one?
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
Amazing! I've never seen such a combination attack before!
Their movements are perfectly in sync!
Aye!
I don't have a good feeling about this!
Here comes the lullaby!
The plants are withering!
It's the curse of the lullaby!
I'll be dining on your souls!
What the heck?!
It didn't do anything!
What's with this sound?
What happened to my beautiful sound?!
I see! After those attacks from before...
They opened up a bunch more holes, so he can't play properly.
So after all this build up, this is the punchline?!
Look, his stomach's empty.
How dare you mock me!
He's snapped!
Both big and bad-tempered!
Ice Make...
Shield!
So fast!
He can use Maker Magic to create something that large instantly?
Maker Magic?
Magic that gives form to magical power.
There's also magic that can steal form away.
Damn you!
All right! Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up!
You... You're a friggin' monster!
What did you call me?!
He's climbing me!
Requip!
The Black Wing armor!
That's a magic armor that will add tremendous power to a single attack!
Ice Make Saucer!
Natsu!
Now!
All right!
With a flaming right hand...
When you combine the flames together...
Try eating some of this!
Dazzling Blaze of the Fire Dragon!
Excellent!
Wonderful!
They defeated Zeref's demon so easily...
W-Wow...
So this is...
So this is what Fairy Tail wizards are like?
They're the strongest team all right! Super cool!
Aye!
How about that? Incredible, yes?
Great going, everyone!
He wasn't nothing too special, was he?
A pushover...
What a bunch of fools...
I'm no match for them...
We've got to get you to a doctor, yes we do!
It's hugging me!
Well, I don't know what was going on exactly, but I guess we all owe Fairy Tail one.
But, look...
They went overboard!
Where'd the regular meeting hall go?
Aye!
A mountain or two are gone!
Master!
Something flew out...
We really did a number on it!
This is no laughing matter!
Somebody capture them!
Kids take after their parents, you know!
Brings back memories of when we were active.
S-Seriously?
You look just like I did when I was younger, Kage deary...
I sure had a lot of fun back then.
We all did so much crazy stuff, the council was always angry at us!
By the way, the hottie is me...
No way that's you!
Kagywagy, you're the image spittin'!
Like hell I am!
Anyway, I think you should be able to understand a bit now.
About how guilds can be fun.
Something came out.
Oh, my.
Okay then, I'll capture them!
You're the one we're trying to capture!
Oh, really?
Take me away to someplace!
Let's ride on a tin horse, just the two of us.
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
It's sad that my beloved doll can't talk to me...
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
Every time I think of you tears start to flow...
I'm a crybaby, aren't I?
In the moon (the moon) at night (at night)
I'm always (I'm always)
searching for the rabbit!
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
so much it's like I'm under a spell.
This love is a monologue
from which I'll never awaken.
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
since I've completely fallen in love.
I wonder what spell I could chant,
to get through to you?
The perfect thing to say.
Spouting this and that,
I just love you like crazy!
One day I want to be able to tell you
You got me.
My words of thanks.
There's nothing more to say!
My wallet's feeling it again this month.
Maybe you could live a richer lifestyle if you didn't keep destroying cities and stuff wherever you go.
If I pay my rent... I won't... I won't have any money left for food!
That's it! If you can learn Natsu's magic, then you could eat fire!
Next time: Natsu Eats a Village.
I see! That solves all my problems!
Huh? No witty reply?
Witty reply? What could make you think that?
Lucy, now you're just being mean...
