And Nidorino begins the battle with a Horn Attack.
Oh, but Gengar bounces right back and there it is,
the Hypnosis Power of Gengar!
This could be the end of Nidorino. Wait! The trainer recalls Nidorino.
Which Pokemon will he use now?
-Oh, it's Onix! -
Now this giant Pokemon is on the attack.
Ho-ho! But Gengar jumps aside.
Gengar is moving beautifully today...
Yes, I am Ash.
Ash Ketchum is a boy from Pallet Town.
And now that I'm ten, I can finally get my Pokemon license.
Ten-year-olds can get a beginner Pokemon from Professor Oak,
the town's Pokemon expert.
I will journey to gain the wisdom of Pokemon training,
and I hereby declare to the Pokemon of the world,
I will be a Pokemon Master.
-Pokemon Master! That's what I'll- Ash, get to bed!
It's 11 o'clock and you should be asleep.
But tomorrow I begin my Pokemon journey. I can't sleep.
Well, if you can't sleep, you should at least get ready for tomorrow.
-Here. Watch this. - Good evening, Pallet.
Tomorrow's the big day for the newest class of Pokemon students.
I'd like to introduce you to Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle.
Each one is available for new trainees. Which one shall you choose?
-Go to bed when this is done. -All right, I'm going.
-And change into your pajamas, okay? -I'm going.
POKEMON I CHOOSE YOU!
Raising Bulbasaur. That'd be really simple.
It's perfect for beginners.
I choose you, Bulbasaur!
Then there's Squirtle.
I choose you, Squirtle!
Choose it or lose it.
Oh, hold on.
Charmander. Those in the know say that's the best way to go.
I choose you, Charmander!
Ah!
Oh, no! What time is it?
Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Charmander. Anyone's fine.
Just, please, save one for me.
Gary, Gary, he's our man.
If he can't do it, no one can!
Oh, sorry. Excuse me!
Hey, watch where you're going! Well, you must be Ash.
Better late than never, I guess. At least you get the chance to meet me.
Gary?
-Mr. Gary to you. Show some respect. -Huh?
Well, Ash, you snooze, you lose and you're way behind right from the start.
I've got a Pokemon and you don't.
You got your first Pokemon?
That's right, loser. And it's right inside this Poke Ball.
Let's go, Gary. Let's go! Yeah, yeah!
Thank you, fans. Thank you all for this great honor.
I promise you that I will become a Pokemon Master
and make the town of Pallet known all around the world!
-Excuse me. -Yeah?
I was just wondering if you could tell me what kind of Pokemon you got.
None of your business.
If you showed up on time, you would have seen that
I got the best Pokemon from Professor Oak.
It's good to have a grandfather in the Pokemon business, isn't it?
Thank you for coming out to see history in the making!
Now I, Gary Oak, am off to learn the ways of the Pokemon trainer!
I'll show you.
So you decided to show up after all.
Oh, Professor Oak. Where's my Pokemon?
-Your Pokemon? -Yes, I'm ready.
You look like you're ready for bed, not for Pokemon training.
I hope you don't think you're going to train in your pajamas.
Oh, no, Professor. I got messed up this morning,
and I was a little late, but believe me, I'm ready for a Pokemon.
I thought about it a lot and it took me a long time
but I finally decided to choose Squirtle. Oh!
Already taken by someone who was on time.
Oh, I wish I hadn't overslept.
But now I will choose as my Pokemon Bulbasaur! What?
That one was also taken by a kid who wasn't late.
Oh. Well, that's no problem
because my Pokemon will be Charmander!
-Ah! -The early bird gets the worm
or in this case, the Pokemon.
Does that mean all the Pokemon are gone?
-Well, there is still one left- - Professor, I'll take it!
I think I should warn you. There is a problem with this last one.
-I have to have a Pokemon. -Well, in that case.
-Pikachu. - Its name is Pikachu.
-Oh, it's so cute. It's the best of all. -You'll see.
-Oh, hi, Pikachu. -Pika.
It's also known as electric mouse.
It's usually shy but can sometimes have an electrifying personality.
-I see what you mean. -Shocking, isn't it?
Now, take these, your Pokedex and Poke Balls.
-Mom. -Oh, Ash, I'm so proud of you.
You're finally going to fulfill your dream and start your Pokemon training.
But I'm going to miss you so much.
Oh, my little boy.
Pikachu.
I packed your sneakers and jeans, nice clean shirts and underwear,
and your favorite snacks and some hot chocolate in case you want something hot
but be careful not to burn yourself and a pair of rubber gloves to do your laundry
and a new clothesline to hang it out to dry-
Mom, you're embarrassing me in front of all these people.
Don't you know I'm a big kid now?
Pokemon trainers can take care of themselves.
I understand. Hmm?
-That's your Pokemon? -Pikachu.
Yeah, that's my Pokemon! -Pi.
Ugh. With Pikachu at my side, I'll get all the Pokemon in the world!
I thought all Pokemon stayed inside their Poke Ball. Why doesn't this one?
Uh, oh, yeah, right. Pikachu, get in the ball now.
-Pi. -Huh?
-Pi. -Huh?
-Ka. -Huh?
-Chu. -Huh?
Pikachu.
Oh, you're playing catch. You're friends already.
Uh, sure.
Pikachu and I are real pals. Right?
- But it's a little weird. - Weird?
Those rubber gloves your mom packed will come in handy!
-Why? -Rubber blocks electricity.
Hooray!
Don't forget to change your underwear every single day.
-Okay. -Pikachu.
Pikachu, are you going to be like this the whole way?
Pi.
- Is it because you don't like me? - Pika, pika.
Well, I like you a lot.
And since you're the Pokemon I'm training,
don't you think you could be a little nicer
and just open your mouth and tell me what's wrong?
That's not exactly what I meant.
- Is your name all you can say? - Pika.
Well, then, you're just like all Pokemon and you should act like one
and get inside the Poke Ball just like it says in the Pokedex.
While being trained, a Pokemon usually stays inside its Poke Ball
-You see? -Pika!
However, there are many exceptions.
Some Pokemon hate being confined.
Okay, then. This ought to make things better.
-And I'll get rid of these. How's that? -Pi.
-Still not good enough? -Pika.
-Pika? -Huh?
-A Pidgey. -Pidgey is a flying Pokemon.
Among all the flying Pokemon, it is the gentlest and easiest to capture,
a perfect target for the beginning Pokemon trainer to test his Pokemon's skills.
This is great. It's our lucky day!
-Pikachu, go get it. -Chu.
-Aren't you ever going to listen to me? -Chu.
-But why not? -Pika. Pika, pika, pika.
Cha!
Okay, I get the message. I don't want your help or need it.
I can get that thing all by myself.
All right, I've pledged to get all the Pokemon in the world.
Now I'm ready to take the next step to be the number one Pokemon Master.
Enjoy your last moments of freedom, Pidgey,'cause you're mine!
Poke Ball, go!
I did it! Huh?
I blew it.
To capture a Pokemon,
you usually have your own Pokemon battle with the other.
Now he tells me.
But I have to do everything myself!
Wait. I've got an idea.
Okay. Just be quiet. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Hi, little friend.
Sorry, buddy!
What happened? Hmm?
Pidgey's gust power creates tornadoes.
-It also has a sand attack. -Sand?
Guess it's not my lucky day.
Hey! Get out of there! Ah.
A forest Pokemon. Rattata.
It likes cheese, nuts, fruits, and berries.
Yeah, but this isn't a forest. It's an open field.
It also comes out into open fields
to steal food from stupid travelers.
That means I'm stupid?
Hmm?
Ah. Hmm?
I'll get you this time.
I got it!
I wonder what that is.
Unlike Pidgey, Spearow has a terrible attitude.
It is very wild and will sometimes attack other Pokemon and humans.
Ah!
Pikachu. Pika!
Hey, leave Pikachu alone! It didn't throw the rock.
Wild Pokemon tend to be jealous of human-trained Pokemon.
-Oh. -Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Ah, you got it!
Spearow!
Uh-oh.
-Uh, should we run? -Pikachu.
Aah!
Don't worry, Pikachu. No matter what, I'll save you!
Pikachu.
Don't run ahead! I said I'd protect- Ow.
-Leave it alone, Spearows! -Pika!
Pikachu!
Well, here we go. Ah!
Huh? Ugh.
Hey, I got a bite! Oh, wow, I really think this could be a big one!
Nah, it's just a kid. Oh, and a Pokemon!
Oh, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. Not you!
Look what you've done to that poor little thing.
-Is it breathing? -Uh, I think so.
Well, just don't sit there. It needs a doctor right away!
There's a medical center not too far from here. You've gotta get moving now!
-You mean a hospital? -Yes, for Pokemon.
-Um, can you tell me, which way do I go? -That way.
They're coming back! Run!
Hey, what are you doing? -I'm borrowing this.
But, hey, that's my bike! -I'll give it back someday!
Oh, you!
- Pikachu. - Just hang on now, Pikachu.
We're almost there.
Huh? Pikachu!
- Chu. - Pikachu, this can't happen.
-Pikachu, get inside. -Chu.
I know you're afraid of going in there but if you're inside, maybe I can save you.
Please, Pikachu. Please listen to me and go inside.
After that, then. After that, just trust me!
Pika.
Spearows, do you know who I am? I'm Ash from the town of Pallet.
I am destined to be the world's number one Pokemon Master.
I can't be defeated by the likes of you.
I'm going to capture and defeat you all! You hear me?
Pikachu, go inside the Poke Ball. It's the only way.
Come and get me!
Whoa!
-Pikachu! Whoa!
Pikachu.
-Well, we beat them. -Chu.
Chu.
-What's that? - There is no data.
There are still Pokemon yet to be identified.
This is just the beginning of the amazing adventures of Ash and Pikachu.
Their journey is destined to be packed with nonstop action, millions of laughs,
heart-pounding perils and endless excitement.
Together they'll encounter fantastic friends, evil enemies
and meet creatures beyond their wildest imagination.
And as their story unfolds,
we'll unlock the magic and mystery of a most wondrous place,
the incredible world of Pokemon.
