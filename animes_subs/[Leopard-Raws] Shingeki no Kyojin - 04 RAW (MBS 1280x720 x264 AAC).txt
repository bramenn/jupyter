In the year 845...
the Colossal and Armored Titans
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,
along with the life we'd known.
And the insatiable hunger of the Titans was unleashed on humanity
after a hundred years of deprivation.
No!
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,
losing twenty percent of its population and a third of its territory,
to retreat within Wall Rose.

The Year: 850
2 Years After Enlistment
You're too slow!
Run, you laggards!
What's wrong, Arlert?
You're falling behind!
Is it too heavy for you?
Will you be the one guy to remove his equipment?
If this were a real fight, you'd be Titan food by now!
Damn it!
Give me that.
At this rate, we'll all fail out!
We're being graded on this exercise.
If you do that, you'll lose points, as well.
Just don't let them find out!
And don't make me change my mind!
Reiner Braun.
A strong soldier, physically and mentally.
And trusted by his comrades.
I will not slow everyone down, even if it kills me!
Armin Arlert.
While lacking in physical strength,
he's demonstrated an extraordinary aptitude for his studies.
Annie Leonhart.
Her strike form is flawless,
but she works poorly with others and tends to isolate herself.
Bertolt Hoover.
He has great potential, but lacks initiative.
Jean Kirschstein.
A master of 3D Maneuver Gear,
but his brash personality causes friction with the team.
I can't strike as hard as those two,
so I'll have to find the Titan first!
I'll be the one who makes it into the Military Police!
Thanks, Jean!
I was right to follow you!
Sasha Blause.
She has unconventional, good instincts,
but they make her unsuited to teamwork.
Connie Springer.
He demonstrates superior physical agility, but lacks mental agility.
They're coming!
Damn.
Mikasa's beat me again in strike depth!
Mikasa Ackerman.
A master of all subjects,
and widely considered one of the best in our history.
Eren Jaeger.
He has no outstanding talents,
but he's worked harder than anyone to improve his marks.
And he is more motivated to attain his goal than anyone.
Ouch...
Sorry, I'm not good at holding back...
Now it's your turn to be the bandit.
What's wrong?
What's the point of this training?
Why are soldiers training to fight people like this?
Only an idiot would fight an opponent unarmed.
Where's your sense of responsibility?
We're soldiers.
We may be called on to fight at a severe disadvantage, and retreat will not be an option.
We must be able to handle any opponent,
whether that means using a cannon or martial arts.
That is our responsibility as soldiers.
Forget all that... Look.
Oh, Annie?
As usual, she's good at slacking off without getting found out by the instructor.
Okay, Eren...
I think that slacker needs a lesson.
Let us show her what a soldier should strive to be.
You don't want the instructor to headbutt you again, do you?
If you don't want to get any shorter,
remember what happened when you came here, and take this seriously.
Hey, isn't that a little harsh?
She's really mad.
I always thought she was scary looking,
but she's way worse when she's really mad.
Let's get going, Eren.
Me?
Annie, you know how to do this, right?
Here I go!
What?
Did she kick my leg?
Can I go?
No, this drill doesn't end until you grab the dagger.
Wait, Annie.
You're supposed to do this a certain way!
Here.
Now it's your turn to attack me.
No, I...
Go on, Reiner...
Weren't you going to teach her a soldier's responsibilities?
Yeah.
Sometimes, a soldier can't retreat.
Like now!
That was amazing.
Where did you learn that?
My father.
Your dad taught you that?
It doesn't matter.
There isn't any point in doing this.
You mean this exercise?
Martial arts won't improve your score.
You should just go through the motions, like them.
The only ones allowed to join the Military Police and go deep within the walls
are those who rank in the final top ten.
The only ones who take this seriously
are either people like you, who do whatever they're told,
or real idiots.
Crap, the instructor...
For whatever reason,
the better equipped you are to fight Titans,
the farther you're assigned from them.
Where do you think this farce begins?
I don't know!
Isn't it because that is how humans really are?
Anyway, I'm not stupid enough
to enjoy playing soldiers in this shitty world.
You aren't cut out to be a soldier at all.
I was so focused on getting stronger, I never even realized...
such an obvious contradiction.
They're honing their Titan-killing skills
so that they'll never need to fight them.
That can't be helped.
Before Wall Maria fell,
only the few in the Survey Corps needed to know how to use Maneuver Gear.
To save the knowledge base from decline,
Just give it one strong blast.
they used the Interior to motivate...
Use the generated momentum, and you'll conserve fuel.
You make it sound so easy.
Well, I guess not everyone can do it...
But it's worth remembering.
If you want to join the Military Police, anyway.
Yeah, I hope I can get in...
I can't imagine a greater honor than serving near the King.
Hey, Marco.
Cut the noble act and tell the truth!
You want to join the Military Police
because life deep inside the walls is soft and easy.
No! I really think that...
An easy life, deep inside the walls?
Until five years ago, this was considered deep inside the walls.
What's your point, Eren?
You don't need to go to the Interior.
You've gone soft enough in your own head.
You...
Don't you think it's strange
that we're training to fight Titans, just to end up farther from them?
Who cares?
For my own sake, I hope they keep this stupid system.
You piece of shit!
Shut up! This is reality.
Stop it, Eren.
Stop.
Screw you!
Let go! My clothes will rip!
Who cares about your clothes?!
I'm so envious!
What are you talking about?
That's right, he...
A ranting idiot with no control.
But I'm different now.
I'll use what I've learned to handle this situation.
What the hell was that?
The martial arts I went through a world of hurt to learn while you were screwing around.
You think taking the easy way out, doing as you please, is reality?
And you can call yourself
a soldier?
I heard quite a commotion.
Would someone like to explain?
That sound was Sasha's fart.
Huh?!
You again?
Learn to control yourself.
In the end, two hundred and eighteen trainees managed to hang on till graduation.
Dedicate your hearts!
Today, you trainee graduates will be given three choices.
You can join the Garrison, protecting towns and reinforcing the walls.
Or the Survey Corps, who risk their lives beyond the walls, in Titan territory.
Or the Military Police, who serve the King, lead the people, and protect internal order.
Of course, only the top ten students,
whose names were just announced can join the Military Police.
I finally made it this far.
Now it's our turn
to devour the Titans!

I did it!
I'm joining the Military Police!
We won't go hungry anymore!
How did I score lower than Eren?
Damn it!
You seriously aren't joining the Military Police, Eren?
You did all that work to make the top ten.
I'd already decided when I began.
I wasn't training to live in the Interior.
I was training to fight Titans.
You'll never beat them!
You do know how many
tens of thousands have been eaten?
We lost over twenty percent of our population, so we know for sure.
Humans cannot defeat Titans.
So?
If you think we can't win, you'll just give up?
Well...
It's true that humanity has only suffered defeat until now.
But we didn't know anything about the Titans then.
Fighting them head-on is pointless.
We did lose,
but the information we gained gives us hope for next time!
Will we abandon the tactics that cost tens of thousands of lives to develop,
and let the Titans eat us without a fight?
Hell, no!
I am going to exterminate all of the Titans,
and escape these cramped walls!
That is my dream...
Humanity isn't finished yet!
Wait, Eren!
If you want to go outside the walls, then go.
I'm joining the Military Police, at any cost.
Eren, when you were talking about your dream...
Yeah, I got that from you.
To live outside the walls, not inside.
I'm joining the Survey Corps.
Are you serious, Armin?
You got the best written test score, so you should use that!
I won't hold you back, even if it kills me.
I'm joining the Survey Corps, too.
Hey, you're the valedictorian...
Join the Military Police!
If you join the Military Police,
then I'll do that.
If you join the Garrison, I'll join, too.
You'll send yourself to an early grave without me.
No one asked you to do this...
I don't want to lose any more family.
They're here!
The main force of the Survey Corps!
Commander Erwin, kill the Titans for us!
Look, it's Captain Levi!
They say he's as strong as an entire brigade.
Shut up.
This is totally different than five years ago...
There are so many people who have high hopes for the Survey Corps!
Everyone's cheered up.
There haven't been any problems for five years.
And they've improved the fixed cannons.
Maybe the big Titans won't come again.
Right!
You can't seriously believe that, you stupid lovebirds!
You think we're a happy couple?
You're getting ahead of yourself, Eren!
Hey, you guys!
Hannes!
I heard you graduated yesterday.
Hard to believe you're the little kids I remember.
What about you?
You've gone from a drunk to a captain of the combat engineers.
Listen to you...
I'm still sorry
I wasn't able to save your mother.
It wasn't your fault, Hannes.
We aren't ignorant anymore.
I'll never let anything that sad happen again.
We will defeat the Titans.
I don't know whether to be happy that you've grown up or not.
Don't die.
Huh?
You're joining the Survey Corps?
Connie, you were so eager to join the Military Police!
I was, but...
Your speech yesterday affected him.
Shut up!
It was my own decision!
No need to feel embarrassed.
It isn't just you.
Thomas...
You can't...
Um, everyone...
I brought meat from the officers' storehouse.
Sasha, do you want to end up in jail?!
You really are an idiot!
Idiots are scary...
Let's all split it...
We can slice it and make sandwiches!
Go put it back!
Yeah...
After all the land we lost, meat is really valuable!
It's fine!
Once we retake the land, we can raise cows and sheep again.
I'll have some of the meat, too!
M-Me, too! Get it ready!
I also will, of course!
You guys...
Why are you standing there, Eren?
We need to get back to work, or they'll find out.
It isn't lunchtime yet.
It's been five years since then...
Humanity is finally regaining its dignity.
We can win!
Our counterattack
has only begun!
So hot!
Wh-What is that?
Samuel!
Sasha!
Samuel,
don't move!
That was close...
The wall has been breached?
Not again...
The Titans will come inside the walls again!
I will annihilate all of you!
Annihilate all of you...
Fixed cannon maintenance team 4,
prepare for combat!
Our target is the Colossal Titan before us!
This is our chance!
Don't let it get away!
Hey, there...
It's been five years.
Hell has reopened its gaping maw.
There is no reprieve as Titans devour soldiers.
In the midst of it all,
Eren rescues Armin from death's door, but...
