Hey!
( !)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
All right! I'll say it!
You are my best, best friend!
(Fly!) When I joke around a bit,
(Shine!) You joke around more in response.
(La La La) Nothing is better than this!
(Why!) Even if something bad happens,
(Fine!) I immediately forget about it!
(La La La)
Always keep it going!
Being together 24 hours a day isn't a problem.
Just like twins, or a parent and child, or clone cyborgs.
Then isn't there no reason to clear your eyes?
Those are completely, completely different issues.
(Fight!) Even when I get in a fight with you,
(Down!) even when I get really down,
(Shy!) even when I feel like I want to be alone,
before I realise it, you're right there; we'll be together even in death!
I wonder why it is.
I want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
time goes 100 times faster!
It's fun, isn't it?
It's way too fun!
As expected of my best friend!
What is it?
The synchro is amazing!
Always making an uproar,
bothering the neighbours a lot.
What time is it now?
And then yo de le hi hoo!
I don't get it at all!
So re doh si la!
It's better than I imagined, the absolute best!
Even if I say this and that, we're still friends. (Hooray!)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
Cha Cha La Cha La Cha Cha!
One day,
I had a talk with my father.
It was about the various happy...

Green Green
Birds are singing in the blue sky.
green green
Green Green
Up on the hill, la la, green is sprouting.
At that time,
my father said, while holding me to his chest,
not to cry, la la la, even at painful and sad times.
green green
Green Green
A gentle breeze is blowing in the blue sky.

Green Green
Up on the hill, la la, green is swaying.
Green is spread out.
Green is spread out.
Green is spread out.

When you absolutely must pass by a menacing crow,
it is extremely important not to lose eye contact.

Narration: Aikawa Rikako
It's true!
The Daiku Cafe had a renovation!
Here it is.
Oh, wow.
They turned it into a cafe.
I've been here before, so you can go ahead and order first, Mio-chan.
Oh, really?
Well then...
I'll take a grande white chocolate mocha Frappuccino.
Eh?
Also, I'd like a shot of espresso with caramel syrup,
hazelnut syrup, chocolate chips and extra whipped cream.
Die!
Wait! Yukko, where are you going!?
The sleeping medicine didn't work on Shinonome.
That's where this comes in!
A mixture that increases the rate of oxidation,
and as added insurance, it also numbs the senses.
Mr. Rust+!
If I get Shinonome to drink this,
I'll easily capture and have my way with her.
What will I do after I capture her?
Well, this and that...
What should I do?
Huh, we're using compasses today.
Nano-chan, did you get a compass too?
Yes!
Everyone.
Today's class is now a free-study session.
Oh! Yay!
Nakamura-sensei collapsed again?
Nakamura sure collapses a lot.
Sasahara, why are you skipping clean-up duty again?
I cleaned up my own area.
You left behind a lot of dust!
I see.
Hurry up and get back there.
By the way, how did you know I was on the roof?
Are you stupid!?
I just came up here because the weather was so nice!
I see.
Thanks for going through the trouble of checking my area, too.
Don't get the wrong idea!
It's not like I'm doing it for you or anything!
Wow.
It's the weekend.
I'm supposed to meet up with Mai-chan in the next town over.
Apparently I'll get free candy, so I'll bite!
Would you like some bread?
Oh no, it's fine.
I ate on my way out!
Aren't dogs, like, against the rules or something?
It's fine.
I need to stand up because my stop is coming up soon!
Coming up next is Tokisadame Wholesale Town.
Tokisadame Wholesale Town.
Nice timing, announcer!
Tokisadame Wholesale Town.
All right.
The exit is to your right.
Let's just get off!
To everyone on the train...
Farewell!
Well, well, well, I'll just say farewell from this side, then.
Endure it!
There's no reason to get embarrassed over such a little thing!
Oh, pardon me!
Oh, I give up!
I'll never see her again.
This is the next town over.
Nobody here knows me.
Don't worry about it!
Wait...
Is she following me?
It must be my imagination.
I'm just thinking too much today.
She said there'd be a Daiku Burger as soon as I left the station...
Where is it?
The map Mai-chan gave me...
It'd be quicker just to ask.
All right!
Excuse me, where can I find the Daiku Bur -
Hey!
Why have you been following me!?
There'll be copyright issues if you do that!
Daiku Burger is right over there.
I'm meeting up with someone there, too.
If you want, I can show you the way.
Sorry, Nee-chan.
I was held up in club.
You're late!
She really was meeting someone?
Sorry for the wait.
I guess Mai-chan isn't here yet.
But seriously...
It's been extremely embarrassing!
Whatever.
I'm in a different town.
That's right!
If you think positively about it,
it's good practise for life.
That's right!
I'll overcome this embarrassment!
Now, I'll be able to overcome anything!
Yukko.
Sorry for the wait.
Mai-chan!
Could that possibly be...
Trick or Treat.
If it's come to this, then there's no helping it.
I'll get my treat.
Trick or Treat.
Are they dressing up for Halloween?
Crows are like this!
I really can't fall asleep.
They say if you count sheep jumping over a fence,
you can fall asleep.
All right, I'll try it.
One sheep...
She fell asleep with one sheep!
Professor, that's amazing!
I'll try, too!
One shee -
The sheep... didn't even make it over.
It's finished.
Thanks.
As expected of Nee-chan!
Does Sasahara-san teach you this kind of thing?
Why does he have to teach me everything?
But don't you guys get along really well?
Not at all! Not at all.
I mean, not at all!
Nee-chan, calm down.
Still, you ironed his handkerchief earlier.
That was just garbage I found on the street.
Eh?
It was Sasahara-san's, wasn't it?
I'm telling you, that's not what happened.
I was just exercising my arms,
and there happened to be an iron there.
Also, there happened to be a handkerchief under it.
Something like that...
Something like that!
She's so easy to read...
But Nee-chan, you looked so happy when you were ironing it.
That's stupid!
At that moment...
At that moment, the Earth was just passing through the Photon Belt!
So, listen to this!
What?
I talked to Ono-kun yesterday!
You're so lucky!
On a train for two hours.
On a bus for one.
From the tough city,
I have come to this remote S-town.
Even though I didn't believe I would ever find it again,
I couldn't give up, and I've continued to search for that book.
That book, which is said to be a myth,
gave colour to my grey childhood days.
It is in this library.
I will be able to read that book in this age.
I am thankful that I happened to meet the donor.
Because of that, I got my hands on it.
With my heart beating fast,
All right, time's almost up.
Everyone, make sure you wrote your name.
Ten.
Nine.
Eight.
Sev -

Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Zero.
All right, pass them forward.
Halloween was a while back.
This coffee isn't very coffee-like.
Huh? It's not coffee-like?
What does that mean?
I don't really know how to explain it,
but it's not really... coffee-like.
Just take a sip.
Come on.
Really, what does it mean to be not coffee-like?
It's not coffee-like.
Everyone!
It's finally finished!
Meet Biscuit 2.
I'm Biscuit 2.
Oh, I remember him.
Such a bland reaction!
Hey, take a closer look!
But I already saw him before.
1 and 2 are different!
He's much more amazing!
My name is Biscuit 2.
I'm a biscuit robot created by Professor Shinonome.
As the name implies,
my power source is biscuits.
I operate on the power of biscuits.
Professor, it's about time for a biscuit.
Eh?
But this is the last one...
Biscuit 2's special skill is speed-reading.
Go ahead.
Finished!
There!
Why aren't you amazed?
Well, I can read fast, too.
Then why do you always read so slowly?
I think that this way...
What's wrong, Biscuit 2?
I get sleepy when I read a lot of words in a book.
That's pretty normal.
Why won't you say it's amazing?
I'm really amazing!
What?
You're mad about something small like that?
It's not something small!
But you were already amazing.
Is that so?
Maybe I made a bit of a mistake.
I don't really think you made a mistake.
Hey, hey.
How amazing am I?
Um, how about as much as the Chichibu Mountain Range?
I don't know how much that is!
Um, then how about the Nullarbor Plain?
Eh? Why not something bigger?
Then, how about a whale?
Oh, that might be good.
Whales are big, aren't they?
Yeah, they are!
It's not that it's fine like that,
and it's not that it's fine like this,
it's fine like that.
What are you doing?
I'm doing sugoroku.
TL Note: Japanese backgammon.
What are you doing?
I have a quiz.
A quiz is peaceful and fun!
Winning money by making the princess happy...
You gotta have something fun like this every now and then.
Right?
The ball was in this one, right?
It's actually in here.
Nice going, number 66.
I can't believe you had that kind of skill.
I'm actually aiming to be an official magician for the empire.
If that happens, you'll have a nice job.
Yeah.
I'm fired up now, too!
I'll definitely win the prize money!
Hey, it's time.
Be quiet.
Now then,
proceed in the order of the number you received.
Number one, please step forward.
I'm first.
Oh, number 66 is first?
The money will be won right away.
An imperial magician, huh?
Seize your dream, number 66.
Now, where is the ball?
I want to be an imperial magician!
Next.
Number two, step forward!
It's time.
Time for my name to be known by the world!
I'll turn this into a chance.
That's...
Number 4, the comedian.
He can do it.
I, number 4, shall be going.
Next.
No way. Number 4, too?
Hey, are you okay?
It's me.
But you said...
I can't believe it turned out like this.
But my only skill is with quizzes.
I must assure that the princess gets it correct.
It's okay.
I won't let myself fail.
I should probably make it a simple one.
I, number 6, will give a quiz!
What kind of bread can you not eat?
Oh, it's multiple choice!
A) Frying pan.
B) Melon bread.
Now, which is the answer?!
What?
I don't know.
That is correct!
I regret everything!
It's over.
Even the quiz master was expelled.
Next.
I, number 7, will recite all the cities that have hosted the Olympics!
I will never forget your courage, number 7.
What's wrong?
Is there no one who can please the princess?
What should I do?
I intended to do a cheer...
You fool!
I was going to break chopsticks with my ass!
I was going to play a bamboo screen!
I was going to chop up a cabbage!
We're all going to be erased.
Hey, hey.
I hope you're not forgetting about me.
You're...
From that comedic stance,
Comedian 13!
I'm gonna go visit the brink of death...
Wait, 13!
That's far too dangerous!
Do you think I'm simply going to do the swan lake dance?
Well, watch closely.
I'll teach you about true comed -
Watch me!
Comedian 13!
Why me, too?!
Next. Number five.
How long are you going to make us wait?
Hurry up!
Who is it?
Who the heck is number five?
Is it you?
No!
That's the number on my hat!
Hey...
Number five is you -
He's finished!
Hey, number five!
Get out here!
What's wrong?
And still!
Next.
I don't care who.
Someone go.
No matter what we do, it's...
No matter how many lives you have, it's not enough for that!
I won't participate in such a selfish kind of recreation!
I'll go stand in the hall!
I'm a sweet grande white chocolate mocha Frappuccino...
chocolate chips and extra whipped cream.
Next time on Nichijou: Episode 19.
Look forward to it!
