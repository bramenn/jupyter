One, two...
This is pretty fun.
You can stop chopping wood now.
Are you done with this?
I'm going to put it away.
S-Sure.
I wish I could have her clean my room, too.
I think it should be done now.
It'll be fifteen minutes in three more seconds.
Do you really need to be so precise?
What are you putting in there?
Miso.
My secret ingredient.
Don't do that in the main pot, please!
Why did you burn the rice?
Can you blame us? We've never done this before!
We'll do it ourselves, then.
Go keep an eye on the curry.
Yo, dude.
Don't act like you can't hear me.
I'm not letting you pretend you've forgotten about me.
Of course I haven't.
I remember your name, too.
Maeda!
It's Maeda!
You and Nakano-san are doing good, right?
S-Sure.
You're lucky you have a partner for the folk dance.
I couldn't find anyone.
So tell me...
How can I get a girlfriend?
Hey, are you listening to me?
I can't wait for the rice to cook.
Uesugi-san.
I'm going to move all this test of courage stuff.
Yotsuba.
Weren't you in charge of the campfire?
Yes.
But I thought you might want some help.
You're here on this camping trip when you usually only camp out in front of textbooks.
I'd like to support you as much as I can.
All right, Maeda, keep an eye on my group's dinner.
Don't go giving me orders!
And aren't you going to hear me out?
The test of courage is optional.
Go invite a girl from class.
Just try not to freak out, because we're going to go all out.
Like this.

Come on, there hasn't been a single ghost.
What're the people in charge doing?
Damn it!
I was hoping the suspension bridge effect would do me a solid,
but this isn't scaring her at all!
That bastard!
He's got a really scary look on his face!
Oh, gosh. My heart's racing now.
Be the suspension bridge you want to see!?
We're doing great.
I'm so happy to see life in your dead eyes for once.
Yeah?
I'm glad I've come back to life.
I was afraid you might not come.
Let's make sure we aren't left with any regrets after school camp.
The next group's coming.
Get them!
We're going to eat you!
Futaro.
Yotsuba's here, too.
Oh, it's you guys.
You already know the gimmick. I shouldn't have bothered.
Whoa, you scared me!
Yeah, right.
You did.
Hey, you're blond.
What did you do? Did you dye it?
It's a wig.
Anyway, there's a dangerous cliff ahead.
Follow the signs...
Miku, are you listening?
Wh-What?
There's a dangerous cliff ahead.
Be sure to follow the signs.
I know.
Let's go, Ichika.
What's wrong? She was rather cold.
Was she?
That aside, Uesugi-san,
I sense doubt in the way you're scaring people.
You need to make a more elaborate entrance.
My classmates told me this forest is haunted.
That's obviously false information.
Same thing with the campfire legend.
They have, like, zero credibility.
Who freaks out over such a cheap toy?
I thought this school camp would be more fun.
Instead, we had to share a room with him right off the bat.
Good thing nothing happened, I guess.
So that wasn't you, was it?
What wasn't?
Go study!
I can't take it anymore!
Wait up, Itsuki!
Oh, dear.
We overdid it.
Huh?
Which way did they go?
You finally got to see Futaro-kun.
You should have stayed a little longer.
I think I'm weird.
Futaro is tutoring all five of us.
What do you think of Futaro, Ichika?
Itsuki!
Where did you go?
Is this even the right way?
No way!
Why is this happening?
School camp's supposed to be fun,
so why am I out here all alone?
No!
Ow...
This sucks!
Are you all right?
I found you, Nino.
No way.
You're...
The photo...
It's the face from the photo!
What are you talking about?
Come on, let's go.
Come with me.
But I'm not...
S-Sorry!
Shit, she's going to kill me.
What?
I'm really sorry.
She's unusually docile.
Hey, what's your name?
Sorry, it's just that I've seen you in a photo before.
You looked really good.
A photo?
I knew there were students from other schools at this camp,
but I never thought I'd meet his relative.
Who is this?!
A-A relative.
D-Don't tell me...
Shoot, this wig!
So wait, does she think I'm the guy in the photo?
This is bad.
Should I tell her the truth?
That the photo was actually of me?
But she might be able to blackmail me with it.
I'd rather not.
I'll have to...
Oh, go straight down here and you'll end up on a bigger path.
Bye.
W-Wait.
I got separated from my sister.
Could you help me find her?
Uesugi-san...
Where are you?
So your name's Kintaro-kun, huh?
Yeah.
Hurry up and get over here, Itsuki.
Or else...
He's totally my type!
Man, I want some booze.
I'm underage, but I want some booze.
I wanna break the law.
How's that?
Do you hate me now?
So wild. I love it.
It had the opposite effect!
Itsu
Your sister may have headed back.
Five lengths below the Big Dipper is Polaris.
North is that way.
Now we know which way we're going.
Wow, you're so knowledgeable.
I like smart people.
Liar.
You're way better than someone who loves showing off his grades.
P-People do that?
You know him.
He's your relative.
Huh?
Let me take a good look at your face.
Sh-Shoot...
Look. You have a bruise on your forehead.
O-Oh...
It's just a scrape.
It'll heal on its own.
I can't allow that.
One of my sisters always comes home injured.
There, all better.
This is throwing me off.
Did you hear a voice or something?
Wait, my sister said this forest is haunted.
Cut it out.
I-I know.
I have this good luck charm!
It'll protect us from any kind of evil!
W-Wait, don't leave me!
I'd be too scared by myself!
Well, I'm not scared.
Huh? The path...
Jeez, he's not very manly.
I'm kind of disappointed.
There's a path this way, too.
It's the edge of the forest, too.
No, you idiot!
That way is...
What?
Shit!
My hand!
Thanks.
I should be the one thanking you.
Where is your sister, though?
Maybe she really did head back.
What's wrong?
Sorry, I don't think I can move.
I'm scared.
Can you hold my hand?
Y-You know, we might be in for more scares here.
What am I saying to a guy I just met for the first time?
Forget I said that.
All right.
That's a really powerful good luck charm.
Hang onto it, and it'll protect you for sure.
There're rumors that it'll even grant your wishes.
Just for you.
Will you be here tomorrow too, Kintaro-kun?
Yeah.
My school's having a campfire tomorrow.
There's a legend about the folk dance that we do.
Any pair that's holding hands during the finale ends up together.
Y-Yeah?
Some even say you'll get together just by holding hands once.
The shyer students do it secretly, out of sight.
That's it?
It's so overblown and childish.
Kintaro-kun...
Would you dance with me?
Uh...
I'll be waiting.
It's that voice.
I-It's coming.
I-Itsuki!
Come on, Itsuki!
Nino!
I was so lonely!
Y-You're too misleading!
Come on, let's go.
O-Oh, okay.
I'm surprised you were fine by yourself.
I wasn't.
I was...
What is it?
I'll be waiting.
What now?
What do I think of Futaro-kun?
I think he's going through his awkward phase.
I mean, he's pretty unbalanced, don't you think?
Imagine if he grows up the way he is now.
I don't mean that.
How do you feel about Futaro?
Miku, I think we should trade spots for the dance.
You're worried, aren't you?
Let's be fair.
You should be his partner.
Try not to regret things.
These times aren't going to last forever.
I wish school camp would last forever.
Reception
You seem happy.
Do you have some good news?
I'm not telling you.
This is a pain in the ass.
I could just dance with her in my disguise,
but I'm already supposed to dance with Ichika.
I can't do both.
I should tell Nino the truth.
Huh? Nino?
What's up, Futaro-kun?
Ichika, Miku! Just who I wanted to see!
I need to ask you
Oh, shoot, I just remembered I have work.
You two young'uns carry on.
What's up with her?
I'm glad you're still here, though.
Have you seen Nino?
No.
Wait, do they hate me more than I thought?
You just noticed?
Just a word of advice.
If you don't want it to get even worse,
stop acting so suspiciously.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is bad.
I have to do something about this fast.
I'm so glad you're here to help me.
You just want me to move these, right?
Right.
They were keeping them in here to avoid the snow.
The team is hard at work for the campfire tomorrow.
All right.
Are you actually a boy, Uesugi-san?
B-B-But it's always easier with more help.
Y-Yeah?
I'm just returning the favor for the test of courage.
Exactly.
I had to do all the scaring myself while you were gone.
It seems like I've been getting a lot of hate.
I need to regain their trust as soon as I can.
It could affect my tutoring.
Let's get the next one.
It's good exercise, too. Two birds with one stone.
Th-This is killing me.
Have I always been this weak?
Nanako-san, do you have a moment?
There's a key next to the shed door.
Ready, and...
It's so heavy.
Oh, hey. I thought you were someone else, Futaro-kun.
You weren't assigned to this, were you?
Where's Yotsuba?
Wait a second. It's not just Yotsuba, but also Ichika here.
This is a good chance for me to regain some respect.
I should have worn a jacket.
Please don't fail on me, my body!
Set communication skills to maximum!
I was helping Yotsuba.
Let's go.
Did you enjoy the test of courage?
Huh? Y-Yeah, it made my heart race.
Excellent.
As a member of the committee, I'm most delighted.
Although my heart was also racing because I wasn't sure you could pull it off.
You got me there.
Wait, hold on.
Why are you talking like that?
It's weird.
How do I usually talk?
You don't go out of your way to talk to us outside of studying, huh?
Tell me what's on your mind.
I see.
So you don't want people to hate you.
Th-That's not really what I meant.
Our Futaro-kun, of all people?
Seriously, that's not it.
Your big sis here will help you practice, then.
Practice? How?
I'm not as good at this as Miku, but...
You! Are you even trying to hold it?
This is so heavy for me!
Nino!
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and do your job.
Itsuki!
Come on, reply.
R-Right.
I was so taken by you that I couldn't focus.
Okay, that was kind of weird.
Just be more normal.
Although even then, there's a trick to it.
Be as strong as Nino when you're talking to her.
And be nice when you're talking to Itsuki-chan.
And always use your own words.
Oh, you can be nice to me, too.
N-Nice, huh?
I'll remember that.
I'm glad I got to talk to Ichika first.
She isn't just the oldest sister for show.
She sees me and the sisters without prejudice.
She has a rational eye.
Okay, next is Mi
What's wrong?
Nothing.
That's the last one.
Now, we're set for the campfire tomorrow.
Tomorrow, huh?
You've heard from Miku, right?
Yeah, apparently we're supposed to be dancing tomorrow.
How did this happen?
It's embarrassing, huh?
Well? Should we practice?
Ichika or Nino...
If I have to choose one or the other...
Should we call it off?
Like you said, it just kind of happened in the moment.
I can't get over the legend thing, either.
And you can deal with Maeda if I'm not there.
Besides, it wouldn't be good for you if the others saw you dancing with me.
Ichika?
Huh?
Why...?
It's not what you think.
Sorry, can I put this down for a second?
Well, let's get it done and head back to the inn.
Huh, there's no more left.
Oh, yeah.
That was surprisingly quick.
Yeah.
Pardon me.
Have you seen Uesugi-san?
Uesugi? That guy?
We haven't.
I see.
I wonder where he went.
Remember when this happened last time?
Is there a reason we're hiding?
Be nice.
Be nice.
No one's looking.
Shoot, I just made it weird again.
Click?
Click?
Wait.
No way...
Where's the key that was here?
Well, they got us.
Next Time on The Quintessential Quintuplets
Quintuplet Trivia!
That blond guy is your type, huh, Nino?
Blond hair dye is against school rules.
He looks cheap.
I bet he goes around not even working.
Right?
I'll have to support him, won't I?
