Stop! Stop!
Wait for the traffic light!
Something interesting's bound to happen this year...
Who will end up crying, and who will be left laughing?
Usotsuki na anata nakimushi no atashi

Why can't things go well between
the liar, you, and the crybaby, me?
You don't notice my styled hair
or my nice set of press-on nails.
Love isn't about the unhappy tears that go along with it.
Those tears only leave my eyes dry and hurt me.
I love this destiny
between only you and only me.
I want to accept your hot feelings
and be taken by you forever.
Despite your uncute, tearful face and your shortness, I still love you.
Episode 16 ...
We won't be able to make it any smaller than this.
Doesn't matter. It's going into the bonfire anyway.
Are we really gonna light it all on fire?
I'll take back what I said before.
What I said on the day of the summer festival.
I don't say things like no matter what happens, we'll always be friends.
After all, there's no one who could replace you.
That's why I'm going to try my hardest to keep our friendship intact.
I guess I must like you or something.
This must be the real confession time, huh?
Just kidding.
I'm glad you're my friend.
You better make sure you don't forget those words.
W-What the hell?! What are you guys doing here?!
Hold him down!
Hurry and tie him up!
Don't hate us for this!
Don't hate you for this? Moto! Help me!
I told you that I'd try my hardest to keep our friendship intact, didn't I?
If everything goes well between me and Takahashi, everything will be fine!
That's why I'm not going to let you confess to her.
This is the best way to do that, right?
T-That's dirty!
You're too naive.
Sorry! Once I'm all finished, I'll let you go.
Love you, Take-chan!
See ya!
H-Hey!
Ah, carry him over to the science room.
Moto!
I didn't want this kind of confession!
They just turned on the music.
Here comes the time for confessions this year!
Ah, look over there! He's confessing to her!
No way!
I do!
Are we getting married out here?
You're crazy.
Takahashi.
I'll only say this once, so listen carefully.
I love you.
Every time I remember, my heart beats so fast... as if it happened only yesterday.
Umm, excuse me...
Do you have a minute?
I'm sorry. Save it for later.
Later...?
Mizuguchi.
Hello?
Nana. Where are you right now?
Huh? I'm helping out at the announcement booth.
Something happen?
How can you ask something like that right now?
He's here...
The announcement booth?
Tell her I'll be right there, so stay put!
Yano just left, headed your way.
And one more thing...
If my intuition's correct, Takeuchi-kun's coming, too.
Think hard about it and give them an answer, okay?
No way...
Both of them are coming...
What'll I do...?
Is Takahashi here?!
Huh? She was just here a minute ago...
Did she go somewhere?
Huh?
She ran away, didn't she?
What'll I do?
I'm still not sure about my feelings...
Damn it! They locked me in!
Out of my way!
It's no good... I'm too much of a coward...
I'm too gutless to actually break the glass...
I'm sure he could shatter it without a second thought!
You're too naive.
I have my own way of doing things.
I can drop down onto the roof of that storage shed.
If I screw up... I'll come back as a ghost and haunt you!
Takahashi!
Takahashi!
I'm sorry, Yano...
I'm... too much of a coward...
Where are you?
Pick up!
Takahashi... Takahashi!
I cannot pick up the phone right now.
Damn it!
Takahashi-
I won't let you go to her!
Hey! Let go of me!
As if!
When did you even...?!
Too bad for you, huh?
God damn it! I won't forgive you for this!
That's my line!
I'll get to her first!
I'll die before I let you!
You wanna fight?!
Damn straight!
Enough!
Fighting over her is useless.
She doesn't want to talk to anyone right now.
Let her be.
She... wanted me to pass that along.
It just means she doesn't want to hear us right now.
That's it, right?
That's pretty much her answer, isn't it?
What the hell is up with that...?
If she doesn't want to hear us out, she should tell us to our faces.
If she wants to refuse us, she should say so herself!
Please try to understand Nana's feelings.
I can't.
Well... I can sort of understand how Yano feels, too...
Hey. Do you know how to forget about an old love?
You find a new love.
If that new love is true, then the old love will naturally become part of the past.
What is... true love?
Takahashi.
You're in there, aren't you?
Please say something.
You're not being fair, running away like this.
Why are you hiding?
It's not like you.
Come on out.
But I can't come up with an answer!
I don't know what's best... what's most right... Will I be able to get through this without crying?
No matter how much I think about it, I just don't know...
I don't want to be hurt anymore...
I don't want to hurt anyone, either.
Hey, Takahashi...
I don't think anyone wants to hurt anyone else...
But I think the person... or people...
And of course, no one wants to make you suffer.
But... in the end, if it has to be that way...
You should stay hidden like this tonight, Takahashi.
But... can I say one thing?
Takahashi... no one knows what's the best, or what the future holds.
Until you actually see the results, no one ever knows.
So at the very least, why don't we rely on what we do know?
Let's keep the feelings we have right now precious.
The feelings I have right now...
Can I really...
You found...
It's that easy.
Goodbye.
And of course, no one wants to make you suffer.
Takeuchi-kun!
Is that all you came for?
Didn't you have something you wanted to say to me?
Like... didn't you have another reason to come?
Yeah.
What was it?
Moto and I...
I thought I'd say that... but anyway, hurry and go see him.
He's being really sulky.
You're both... so nice...
I need to answer you...
Yano, where are you?
I'll give you as much love as you want!
I'm watching you, so...!
I'm always watching you, so...!
I'm always watching over you, so...!
Nanami, you big liar...
I don't want to hurt him...
And then I chase after him again...
Why do we keep falling in love with each other?
Why did you come?
Because I thought you'd be crying.
I'm not crying, damn it...
I'm not...
You've always annoyed me from the start...
You say your own selfish things, and you stir up all my feelings...
You're so clingy...
You're cruel.
Yet despite all that...
You annoy me.
I wish I could rewrite my past.
But I can't.
That's impossible.
What kind of present will make your past pale in comparison?
Something like this...
A reality where I exist and you're there next to me.
Will I be able to become stronger...?
I have a condition.
Tell me all about Nana-san.
I don't know much about her.
I haven't pressed the issue so far because I've been thinking of you.
I want to hear about your feelings for her, and once I sort out my feelings about them...
It might be difficult for you, but... I think it's necessary for this to work.
I want you tell me about Nana-san with your own words from your own mouth.
If you can't do that, I can't come back.
Can you?
I didn't see the meaning in doing something like that...
Will you just run away from it?
I guess you would. There's no way you could confront it now.
After all, you've been running from it for two whole years now.
Who said I couldn't do it?
So you do feel like talking about it.
If you can do it, and do it well, I'll give you this as a present.
You...!
Didn't you tell me you erased it?!
I asked you over and over, but you kept telling me you didn't have it, didn't you?!
I was obviously lying.
Looks like you're a little naive yourself.
Don't worry. I won't try to pull you down.
I just want to say that now that Takahashi's serious, you'd better get serious, too.
If you only take a half-assed attitude towards this, you have no right to make up with her.
That's so lame!
Shut up.
So in the end, you didn't confess to her at all?
There's no way I could...
Why are you going about this in such a roundabout way?
As long I'm going out with Yano, we'll eventually run into this problem again...
I wonder if he'll be able to talk about it...
He told me he would.
I'm kind of interested to know how he feels in his heart.
Umm... Takeuchi-kun, would you listen with me to the story about Nana-san?
Huh? Me?
Honestly, I'm really uneasy about it...
I'm also a really nice person, I guess.
Huh?
Or maybe...

Everyone's in the way. I waved my hand, but your back is
already swerving through the crowd of people and sinking into the evening sun.
I closed my eyes and began to remember
the words you told me. Only happy memories
are supposed to be there, but I become anxious.
Why does my heart waver so?
I want to tell you about my overflowing feelings...
I love you, I love you, I love you more than anything.
Wherever I am, whatever time it may be
you're always there for me.
And I'll accept that because
these memories won't fade.
One day, under the deep sea, the time we had
will become blue sand.
And I wonder if it'll be put to sleep
like these undying feelings I have right now...
I'm quivering alone
in this bed without you.
But when I rolled over, I couldn't see the blue sky.
You always loved
looking out at the town
from this room, didn't you?
The passing seasons
were gentle to us.
Things got awkward, and we became unable to speak to each other,
and you returned to the sea.
But I feel that you're still
living the closest to me, with me.
When I accept the loneliness
I try to leave it to someone else
because it's a little easier that way.
Come dawn,
I'm in this bed without you
quivering alone.
But when I close my eyes, I can see the blue sky.
Look, another star shot by in the summer's night sky.
We lovers could feel it in our hearts and upon our bodies.
With just the warmth of your hand holding mine,
I feel like I could go anywhere, fly anywhere.
Instead of counting the infinite stars,
I'd rather stay like this with you,
forever connected to you.
Even if I get hurt, or hurt you,
I don't know what I'd do.
But I love you.
Look, you're smiling, and your heart must be beating faster.
We're clumsy, and we can't say things very easily.
I'd like to keep the feelings we have now precious
and not wait for them to arrive tomorrow, or have missed them yesterday.
Instead of painting my dreams,
I'd rather stay like this with you,
forever embraced.
I want to protect you
so you'll strongly leap into my arms.
I don't know what I'll do
but I love you.
A silent rain falls.
A slightly chilly rain.
But it continues to fall, without actually hitting me
as if it's trying to freeze my heart instead.
I've always found your gentle back
on any day, but where do my
winding feelings point?
I wonder what you see
before you?
We keep on running
and we seem like we're going to reach, but don't.
At that distance away from you.
Rain will fall again someday.
A slightly lonely rain
will pour all around and spread
as if it's meant to soothe my heart.
I'm always looking at your cute back
but these winding feelings
point me in the other direction.
What am I waiting for
at the end of my search?
We keep on running
and we seem like we're going to reach, but don't.
At that distance away from you.
We keep on running
and we seem like we're going to reach, but don't.
At that distance away from you.
At that distance away from you.
At that distance away from you.
Episode 17 Preview...
I met her in my second year of middle school...
That's all.
Takahashi... are you sure it's not Moto...
Oh, just forget it... There's no helping it today.
It'll just be a normal date.
I've never done anything with my dad before.
My chest hurts...
