Just up ahead, I'll defeat Erza...
and become an S Class wizard!
Somebody's there!
Who could it be?
Gildarts!
Hello there, Natsu.
You drew the short straw, huh?
It's over...
Recently, on Fairy Tail...
What is it?
The bells are ringing?
Them ringing like this means...
Aye!
Gildarts has come back!
Aye, sir!
Not like I care, but what's the celebration about?
It's like a festival, Carla!
Definitely one festive guild...
It's only natural for everyone to celebrate.
It's been about three years since he came back.
So, the entire city was reconstructed with this in mind?!
That's amazing! Isn't it, Carla?
Yes. Amazingly stupid.
He's coming!
Aye!
Gildarts, fight me!
Right off the bat with that?!
I told you to fight me!
I knew it! He's crazy strong!
Fairy Tail! As we have done since days long past,
I will now announce the participants in this year's S Class Wizard Advancement Exam!
Each of your powers, hearts, and souls...
I have judged them all this past year...
There will be eight participants!
Natsu Dragneel!
All right!
Gray Fullbuster!
Finally, the time has come...
Juvia Lockser!
Huh? Juvia is participating?
Elfman!
Those who are Men should become S Class!
Cana Alberona!
Fried Justine!
Levy McGarden!
Mest Gryder!
Natsu versus Gildarts.
And this is Tenroujima.
The first trial is a test of might as well as luck.
This is D route, one of the eight possible paths...
S-She's strong! I had no idea she was this strong!
It's...
What's wrong, Juvia?
You won't be able to become an S Class Wizard like this!
Sea Empress Armor...
Then you intend to nullify Juvia's water attacks!
Juvia will... beat you!
Water Slicer!
You can repel Water Slicer?!
You're mine, Erza!
I'm not done yet!
Take-Over!
Your skill has improved, Lisanna.
But as always, you have trouble with distances.
And that makes you a washout!
What am I here for, a critique?!
I see...
When Erza-san evaded Lisanna-san's attack,
she left herself open, even if just for a moment...
If I aim for that...
Then how about this?!
Now! Water Cane!
Owww...
Don't make me laugh, Juvia.
When it's two against one, attacking while your foe is busy
responding to your partner's attack is all too obvious.
If I'm expecting such an attack, then I'm not open at all.
It's an elementary lesson!
The first time I met you, at the Tower of Heaven,
I sensed you had more drive than this.
Was I mistaken?
I shall give you no quarter, Juvia!
Meanwhile, Lucy and Cana had successfully passed the first trial...
I'm back among the living...
Doesn't it feel great?
You're too sensitive to heat.
What can I say? Too hot is too hot!
We'd better get going.
We don't have to leave right away. Just a little longer!
What's with the leisurely attitude?
What?
Has Natsu's stupidity rubbed off on you recently?
Words will never hurt me...
Anyway, I don't wanna leave here just yet.
I know! As long as we're here, let's wash our swimsuits!
Yeesh...
And on A route...
Of all people...
To run into you...
Little brother or not, I'm not gonna treat you with kid gloves, Elfman.
W-What the hell?! I'm here too, you know!
So this is the power...
I'm no good at holding back...
I'm all fired up!
Er, Happy, what the hell are you doing?
Preparing to go home.
No need. Whether my opponent is Gildarts or whoever...
My punch is gonna make him cry out, It hurts!
It hurts.
Too early! I haven't done anything yet!
Here I go, Gildarts!
I'm gonna show you just how strong I've gotten these past 3 years!
Hold on a moment.
Calm down, Natsu.
I'm not mentally prepared yet...
Hey...
Don't rush him without thinking!
Gildarts can pulverize his opponents!
Crash!
I just told you I'm no good at holding back...
N-Natsu's been obliterated...
As if!
He crushed the ground and used it as a cushion?!
I'm still goin'!
He's a punching bag!
Natsu's face...
He's so serious...
And yet, he's smiling...
Fire Dragon's Roar!
You've gotten stronger, Natsu...
Child of the Dragon...
No!!
Natsu...?
The power just...
How could you...?
Test or not, you went way overboard...
Natsu's...
No.
I don't think he's dead.
That's not the kind of magic it was.
See?
Huh?
I used Disassembly Magic.
Lots of Natsus!
Ow!
H-He'll return to his normal form soon.
But unfortunately, this is the end of the line for you, Natsu.
You fail the...
Hold it right there!
I haven't thrown in the towel yet!
Tell'em!
Don't underestimate me just'cause I've gone chibi!
I'm all fired up!
I'm Natsu!
No, I'm Natsu!
This is scary!
I just had a good idea!
This is actually a stroke of luck!
With this many me's, I'll be able to beat Gildarts!
You made a big mistake!
This fight belongs to me!
This is the first time anyone has dared fight me
after turning into multi-munchkins!
I'm exhausted...
Now's my chance!
Aye, sir!
Fire Dragon's Sword Horn!
Sword Horn!
Oh. Natsu...
Hey!
Say it hurts, Gildarts!
Say it!
What? Let a guy relax, would ya?
I just got home.
Oh, shut up! I'm gonna take you apart!
Take you apart!
Here I go! Fire Dragon's...
Iron Fist?!
Natsu!!
Owww...
The guy's a monster!
Are you okay?
But I'm gonna beat that monster!
Aye!
Gildarts!
Fight me!
Yo.
Eat this!
Knockout!
Not Eat this.
I-I'm back...
He's at it again...
This makes how many times?
That kid never learns his lesson.
Still, to keep facing Gildarts, no matter how many times he gets slapped down,
he deserves recognition for his courage.
He deserves recognition for his courage, she says!
Who the hell do you think you are?
You got something to say to me, wench, why not just get it off your chest?!
Don't go acting like you're some kind of mentor!
I'll clean the floor with you!
I'm back! And now...
And now...
Fire Dragon's Claw!
That's pretty low!
Grin...
Scary!
Amusing!
Come outside, Natsu.
He's already outside!
Hold on! Time out!
That looks more interesting, Erza!
Mm! What do you say we check it out?!
Nobody around here has ever heard of an indoor voice!
But you're going to watch it too, aren't you, Gray?
Well, I guess...
What's wrong, Cana?
Aren't you going?
I'll pass...
Suit yourself.
You haven't even hit him once, Natsu!
Oh, shut up...
What's wrong? Is this all you've got?
Listen up, Gildarts...
You're strong, the strongest in the guild...
You can barely stand up, Natsu...
And that's why I'm gonna beat you one day, I swear it!
That sounded cool, Natsu, but I think it's iffy at best.
You'll see... I swear... I'll...
Yeah...
I won't pull my punches either...
And I ain't gonna lose...
Here I go, Gildarts!
It's an army of Natsus!
He never learns...
Here I go! Fire Dragon's...
Roar!
Iron Fist!
Claw!
Gross!
Annoying little turds!
I'm all fired up!
Go back to your normal form!
Now's my chance!
Dragon Slayer Magic!
He's close!
Crimson Lotus: Exploding Flame Blade!
Is it over?!
I don't believe it! Natsu gave it everything he's got!
And it had no effect whatsoever?!
I wouldn't say that! Look closely, Happy!
I moved Gildarts from his original position!
That's one giant step!
You moved him?
Come to think of it, Gildarts didn't take even one step!
On the other hand, he beat you senseless without even taking one step, Natsu!
And you're staggering!
I am not!
You're not?!
Very impressive, Natsu.
I have a good sense of your power.
As an examiner, I could pass you right now, but...
Don't give me that crap!
If I can't defeat you, becoming an S Class Wizard would be pointless!
I figured you would say that.
That's why I ain't gonna hold back on you.
What is this pressure?!
You walk the path of magic, but to arrive at its summit,
there's something you still need.
Learn now what that is.
W-What is this?!
Magic... Incredibly powerful magic...
Natsu...
Excellent...
I find no fault with you when it comes to standing against me with courage.
However, very few have the courage to sheathe their sword once it's out.
Fear is not evil...
It tells you what your weakness is.
And once you know your weakness, you can become stronger as well as kinder.
It's necessary in order to become an S Class Wizard.
That's what you learned today.
You pass.
B-But...
Go. The examiner says that you pass.
But the exam isn't over yet.
The Master is behind this, so you know an even more arduous test awaits you.
Have confidence. I know you can do it.
And now let me speak to you not as an examiner, but as a good friend...
It isn't all about powerful magic...
But I know how you feel, your desire to win...
Age or career has nothin' to do with it...
I'm the same way, see...
I don't wanna lose against you.
I'll fight you again, anytime.
Go on, now, and become an S Class Wizard, Natsu.
Come to think of it, it feels like I haven't seen Mest for a long time.
Where was he again?
He was Mystogan's disciple, right?
They were probably traveling here and there together.
But he wasn't around in Edolas...
Yeah, now that you mention it...
Huh? Have I met Mest before?
Oh, come on! You must have met him sometime...
Next time: Mest!
For example, there was that time... um...
Huh?
He probably used magic to make himself fade into the background.
Oh, I see!
