the classroom is having a boring class
this boring
Oh my! This must be what they call a karaoke box.
What, Nagi-sama? It's your first time doing karaoke?
Yes, it's really unusual.
Haven't you ever gone with your sister?
I haven't, since our interests are different.
Rather, why are you here?
Why of course, because Jin-kun is here.
Umm, don't get too close to me.
Hey, get off of him. He doesn't like it.
Somehow you're so popular that it even seems deliberate, Mikuriya.
But why don't you look happy?
Oh, has someone entered songs already?
That's me. Since we can sing all we want, it will be in place of a BGM.
The first one has got to be this one!
Uh... this is in many ways... yeah...
When was that song from?
I'm sure it was before we were born.
Like I said, how long are you guys going to be standing there?
Come on and sit down already!
What is this book about?
We choose the songs that we want to sing out of the titles written here.
Jin-kun, how do you read this singer's name?
Where?
This one.
Well... hmm Ichiyao...
Sorry, I'm not really good with things like this.
What is this...
They're swirling hard, a lot of things.
Yes.
Well anyway, this karaoke is supposed to strengthen our friendship.
Everyone, be frank and lively!
Friendship amongst these members?
Quit chattering! It's a waste of time!
Who's singing first?
Geez, you guys can't decide!
Rock paper scissors, got it?
The losers start putting in songs!
So then,
Rock paper scissors!
A girl who isn't used to singing trying so hard is nice!
Takako, you're a pervert.
Well, thank you for listening.
Gosh, I hate being the first one up...
So, who's next?
Jin-kun, what kind of songs do you like?
Nothing in particular...
So then,
Next is Daitetsu-kun.
I've never heard Daitetsu-kun's singing before.
Come to think of it, neither have I.
So then, has god given two talents at once?
Let us hear it then.
Then, a ballad.
Amazing.
He's naturally good.
It's a charming bass.
This man is loved by the god of art!
Is he getting Muse all for himself?
He's great.
Wow, so that's what this button does.
It's exquisite.
You were great, Daitetsu.
No, but I was nervous.
That was my first time singing.
That was your first time?
Well, there usually aren't many occasions where I can sing.
Jin-kun?
Where are you going?
To the bathroom!
Who's next?
It's me.
I put this in thinking you would sing it.
I won't.
Such a niche class of anime song.
Hey, what are you putting in a popular song for?!
Even I can read the atmosphere around here!
No! Put in anime songs, got it?
And ones that you would especially recommend!
What kind of embarrassment play is that?!
All right!
Excuse me!
He's naturally good and the song is quite natural.
Not fun.
Oh Mikuriya, good timing.
Order a Lemon Squash.
One Lemon Squash please.
How was that?
What is that song?
An original video animation from 15 years ago.
An insert song in Youjyu Kishin Chaos Blade.
Run away with you!
That's my recommended song, damn you!
You guys got less excited, didn't you!
Right?
Don't underestimate an otaku, damn it!
Annoying.
Takako, you're the worst.
Who's next?
I-It's me.
You haven't chosen yet?
I've never done anything like this before so...
Oh, then why don't we do a duet together?
Hey, let's do it!
If I were to do something like that, I'd rather sing alone.
Throw-
This is...
Not too good...
There's really nothing to comment about.
Isn't it as expected of him in a way?
Excuse me.
Here's your Lemon Squash.
Oh yes, thanks.
I will take away the plates.
Oh, these too please.
I will be wiping the tables.
Excuse me!
Encore! Encore! Encore!
Why you!
Mikuriya ran off...
Well that was pretty embarrassing, so...
He was exhausted by the second half.
But he did manage to sing until the end.
You're next, Nagi-san.
That's right. I'm excited!
You should give a bit of that courage to Jin.
Oh, but it might be enough.
Since you're already giving so much to Jin.
What do you mean?
The old Jin would never have sung in front of others.
Really?
Yes.
He seems to have changed a little after starting to live with you.
Don't worry about it too much.
It was your first time, so it's natural that it didn't turn out as you wanted it to.
It was your first time too, wasn't it?
That's true, but...
You're lucky you can do anything well.
I can't do anything right.
No need to rush.
You can improve step by step.
Everyone has their own strengths.
Daitetsu...
Whether it's singing or drawing,
you have your good points.
I'm sure of it.
Daitetsu, what are we singing next?
Eh, we have a next round?
I shall sing!
What the heck is that song?
Dokkoi Foods, the song of Hello Soybeans.
Oh, that advertisement song.
Why do you know such a song?!
They had it at Tatsuya!
I can sing the theme of Shirigiya Supermarket too!
Nagi basically only rents out songs like this...
She's of the ripe age, yet lacks the sex appeal.
Tatsuya, Tatsuya of where?
Being of the ripe age yet lacking sex appeal?
I'm sorry to interrupt you when you're getting all excited, but...
It's your turn right, senpai?
Since you can say all you want to everyone like that,
you must be such a great singer.
Well, how about we see how you do?
Oh no, Akiba-kun.
Takako is amazing when she sings.
Disgusting.
Disgusting.
Disgusting!
But she's good...
She's good, but disgusting.
Zange-chan, where are you going?
To freshen up.
How was it?
How was it you ask, but...
Oh man...
What do you think?
I don't know how to answer...
An anime voice that's completely different from her usual figure.
Why is even her dance so perfect?
Uh, but the quality was so good it could have been cut as a single.
Only teens should be allowed to sing this song, I guess?
I'm still in my teens!
It's a counter-reaction.
Oh, I see.
A counter-reaction.
Sure she would make a counter-reaction.
What are you guys all in consent about?
It's just what I like, so what's wrong?
Just when I thought I would win by being the last one...
That kind of impact is cheating!
Don't you have a song you're good at?
Huh? Singing nursery rhymes at the karaoke is just ridiculous!
All right, I got it.
I'm sorry I said too much.
Then, let me do as I wish.
Since you also want to be liked by that boy too.
Why are you trying to sing continuously?
Because nobody else is singing!
But Zange-chan should be next.
She isn't back yet.
Did she get scared and run away?
What does that mean, Neesama?
You sure took a long time.
What were you doing?
Just a strategy meeting.
It's my turn on stage, eh?
Yes, we take turns.
A song reveals your inner self.
Places like these are the best chances to understand each other.
Dokkoi Soybeans is out of the question!
It's Hello Soybeans by Dokkoi Foods!
I, who am rumored to be making a CD debut, shall let you hear a true girl's song.
What is this turn of events?!
Jin-kun.
I don't mind being unable to sit beside you.
But, I would like a place in your heart.
Please listen.
Y-Yeah...
Huh?
This is...
Bad.
But she's cute!
She's bad but she's cute.
She's the opposite of you in one sense.
This is in one sense a counter-reaction.
Hey!
Isn't that against the rules?!
It was made like this!
Jin seems troubled!
Get away from him!
You're not, right?
W-Well...
Does karaoke usually have such complicated matters swirling around?
No, I don't think so.
Oh, I guess time's up.
Too bad.
Finished? Then second round!
Here we go!
Huh?
Next, only duets!
Jin-
Daitetsu, let's sing together!
I'm sweating in a strange way now.
Yes, a strange feeling of fatigue.
Jin, what's the matter?
It seems like I'm forgetting something.
Shino-senpai didn't sing anything!
That's true!
That's unfair, senpai!
Shino?
You shouldn't let her sing!
Oh, why is that?
Because her eyes will open.
Right?
Yes.
But...
If you...
Next time on Kannagi...
Huh? Nagi?

That day, my heart skipped a beat on that hilly road.
I am slowly scorched by the sunshine
I pinched my cheek for what happened in my dream.
Feeling your lips, hiding my shaking hands
I tried my best to act nonchalant.
The sweat sparkled.
You always strike without notice.
But I have my pride, you know.
But someday, I want to become honest.
You are still dazzling.
I want to get close to you in a more natural way.
But taking you by force is too boring.
But you see, this isn't bad after all.
Always be by my side.
I want to be the first star that twinkles in your evening sky.
I believe you forever,

Let's run away
A city sky shining with neon signs.
Skyscrapers wearing dirty dreams.
In this night where violence crawls,
the fallen angels lure and smile.
Smoldering in the deep part of my heart,
surpass rage and go on a journey.
If I were to be hurt because of love,
let me be ripped from the tip of my finger.
Oh I want to drown in tears, oh I want to drown in tears.
If only love is the one last bond,
even memories become obstacles.
Love nakedly.
Let's run away!

Throwing away the inferior heart.
I run past the alle y.
Don't look back or you will be caught.
There is no yesterday.
I'm okay with everything if I'm with you.
A red rose being back to back.

A lonely...
Yes, a piercing...
With you, even to hell.
Oh the sadness burns.
Oh the pure feelings reach high.
