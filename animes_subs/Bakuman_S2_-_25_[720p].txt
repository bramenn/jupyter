Dream of Life
I won't give up on it, won't be persuaded
My dream is the one irreplaceable thing
The chagrin I've felt I always bore with pride
This story will change all my solitude into something positive
Even if we rise above our life, a different one awaits us
I will cut a path for my future
Inside my heart lies a dream I wish to protect
so I can go on believing, chase the wind and put my hopes on it
There is only one place I have my eyes set on: where we can laugh together
There lies a light that connects to the dream you gave me
I will lead you towards a future neither of us is aware of yet
When I look back I see my footsteps
made by countless moments of happiness and sorrow
This proof that I have lived until today is what lends me strength
I will engrave it into my chest and walk forward with proud strides
I have a dream I want to see through
I can alight my passion, set fire to it
As we pursue our dreams, we will meet and split
You taught me a strength only I wield
I will stand up, go on, no matter how often I stumble

Dream of life
First chapter storyboard...
Complete!
It's way better than before!
Yeah, even I can tell!
Shujin, let Hattori know.
Right!
In only five days, they've redone it from scratch and taken it this far!
It's much better!
Oh thank goodness.
I suppose you two didn't get much sleep?
So,
how else can we fix it?!
Can it get better?!
So that it can definitely beat Niizuma!
Let's see.
Is the title okay as is?
Perfect Crime Club...
It may be a bit stiff.
Yeah...
It should be more shounen manga-like.
Well, there's the tried and true method of putting the protagonist's name in the title.
Like Captain Tsubasa?
Yeah.
Tanto was like that, too.
That way you know right away what it's about and who's the main character.
It's certainly easy to tell from that, and it's simple and easy to remember.
If that's the case, then...
Chimitsu Kei... it doesn't leave much of an impression.
It may be too plain for a main character.
Oozora Tsubasa.
Sakuragi Hanamichi.
You want a well-defined name with as much impact as those.
A name suitable for a main character...
Speaking of main characters, there's one more thing you need to fix.
One more thing?
A design suitable for a main character.
Since the setting calls for a normal elementary school kid, we want it to be realistic,
so to a certain degree it's okay, but he's just too normal right now.
There's no difference between him and his classmates.
The impact of his appearance...
This is more important than his name, isn't it?
You're right.
He needs to have a special characteristic.
I'll do his character design.
Takagi, you worry about the name and the title.
Let's redo all the main characters' names, not just his.
Got it.
I'll think of them as soon as I can.
You don't have to hurry with the names, since we can just cut and paste them in.
But the character design needs to come first, so I have to hurry.
I've given them all the advice I can.
I'll leave the rest to them.
I've got you two assistants.
I've made sure they're suited to your art style.
Oh, and we've got Orihara on board, too.
Counting backwards... we'll make it if we start the manuscript around the 13th.
The 13th is the New Year's party.
Oh, right.
If we have a new serialization, we have to go, don't we?
The New Year's party.
I want to do what my uncle couldn't do, and the things he left undone.
What he couldn't do?
What he left undone?
What he couldn't do was make a living off of manga alone.
What he left undone was getting first place in the rankings!
Is the coming of age ceremony over already?
How could I let you keep working alone when I haven't come up with character names or a title yet?
Iwase and Ishizawa were there too, so we ducked out early.
But you've really drawn a lot of them.
There must be a hundred.
I've drawn everything I could think of.
Is there one that jumps out at you?
You're the one who knows the most about art.
I'm good with whatever you come up with.
I haven't come up with anything yet, which is why I'm still drawing.
Since we want to keep things realistic, there's a limit to what I can do with the hair.
Ugh, I don't want an elementary school kid looking like that.
I know!
I guess we can't go to today's New Year's party, after all.
Oh, it's Abe!
We saw each other at the ceremony.
Hey!
Yeah.
I'm not home yet.
Huh? Right now?
Both of us?
Ashirogi isn't coming?
What a shame.
They're working hard, aren't they?
I'm happy.
I can't believe they'd give up this brief time of enjoyment.
So...
What's up with that outfit, Akira?
It's punishment for the editors whose authors didn't show up.
And you, Yuujirou?
Fukuda is still drawing his manuscript.
Boss Fukuda isn't here either?!
What are these people thinking?
Hiramaru.
We'll have to work harder, too.
Let the hardworking folks work hard.
Meanwhile, I can take a break.
I'm living large with these Otter figures selling like pancakes!
Do you want one, too? An Otter figure
Aoki!
Hiramaru, I misjudged you.
You are conceited.
Hey
I was just joking! Hey, wait!
You got what you deserved, Hiramaru.
Oh, Akina!
Happy New Year!
Congratulations.
Your latest manuscript was fantastic.
I'm counting on you for the rest.
Of course it is.
I will become the best in the business.
I'm expecting art that's even better than your usual quality.
Roger!
The editor swap put a fire under Akina.
We've got some powerful rivals, Ashirogi Muto!
Akira!
Yuujirou.
It looks like you're up.
Are we seriously doing this?
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for!
Next up is the Hattori combo, Giraffe Akira and Zebra Yuujirou with Otters 11 !
Hello?
It's Mashiro.
I'm sorry we couldn't make it to the New Year's party.
Don't sweat it, this is part of an editor's job.
Thanks to that, I've finished the character design!
Oh, really?
I'll be going back to the officecan you send me a fax?
Yes.
The phone strap idea is good.
The way he changes modes with glasses isn't forced.
It's good!
I'm glad!
Put this in the manuscript right away.
Right!
It's been a while!
Nice to be working with you again!
You too.
Sorry we made you wait for half a year.
What are you talking about?
I've grown over this past year, and I'm ready to bust my tail for you!
The new assistants will be here soon, won't they?
Right.
Moriya and Shiratori, right?
He said they're both younger than us, I think.
It's the first time our assistants will all be younger.
I'm getting kind of nervous.
Because you're shy, Saiko.
Oh right, about this Moriya guy...
So he was a finalist for the most recent Tezuka prize.
That's some strange art.
But it's good. He has design sense.
I couldn't find anything on Shiratori.
They're here!
This is Moriya. He's one year younger than you two.
He was attending design school,
but after he was a finalist for the Tezuka prize, he left to draw manga.
Yes. If I'm aiming to be a manga author,
I figured it would be quicker if I start out as an assistant.
This is Shiratori. He just graduated from high school last year.
He applied to be an assistant for Niizuma,
but his assistants had already been decided on, so I brought him over here.
I didn't get in to art school and was wondering what I was going to do...
when I saw the recruitment for assistants.
I love drawing, so I'm glad.
You haven't actually drawn any manga before, right?
Right.
But I like reading them.
I guarantee their skill.
Looking forward to working with you.
Looking forward to working with you.
You, too.
We're counting on you.
Mashiro.
Yes?
This is your third serialization.
You can take it from here, right?
Yes!
Then I'll get going.
Good evening!
Th-Then...
I'm going to give you each a copy of two pages of the manuscript with a rough sketch of the backgrounds.
Please draw it in.
I'll choose one of you to do backgrounds so that the style doesn't change from page to page.
So only one of us will be able to draw?
Sounds good to me.
Okay, I'll do my best.
Skill is a given, but they need speed and sense, too...
I'm finished.
What?
Me, too.
What?!
Please look over it.
Okay,
But I'll only decide once Orihara is finished.
I understand.
I'm done!
Even I'm getting nervous.
Yeah.
I'd like to ask...
Shiratori to do backgrounds.
Yay, I get to draw!
That's great, Shiratori!
Congrats!
Why him?!
His art is nearest to what I imagined.
Until the style of this manga is solidified, I'll have Shiratori do it.
I understand.
Anyway, this Perfect Crime Club is really good!
Yeah, I like how it's unique.
The title's still a placeholder. I'm planning on changing it.
The main character's name, too.
Really?
As long as we have the time, I'm going to keep nitpicking over the details until I'm satisfied.
Well, I don't think the title and the main character's name will really affect the rankings.
You're really thinking this through.
Rankings, huh.
There's something wrong about stuff like rankings.
There's no point in drawing manga just to get popular.
But manga is for everyone to enjoy, right?
Popularity is important.
You can't draw a good manga if you think like that!
Though since you don't draw any manga, I suppose it has nothing to do with you.
Then what's your ideal manga?
To me, manga is a form of self-expression and a fine art.
I believe all manga should be thus.
Fine art, huh?
If you do it that way, you'll feel good about yourself, but it won't sell.
Jack is a business,
so the manga has to appeal to a majority of people.
Isn't it obvious that rankings and sales figures are important?
To try and draw for Jack without understanding that...
Shiratori, you've gone too far!
Saiko...
Please tell us
your opinion.
We are trying to get this to sell.
But that's because we don't have the talent.
Parents used to say to their kids... well, maybe they're still saying this...
Reading manga makes you stupid.
They wouldn't let them read it.
But manga gradually came to be recognized as having cultural value.
That's why I think you should draw a manga with content and quality that you wouldn't be ashamed to say has cultural value.
But since we don't have the ability to do that, we have to draw it with popularity in mind.
I think it's okay for anyone to draw manga like that, in accordance with their abilities.
Yes, everyone should draw in their own way.
Good work, Mashiro.
Oh, thanks.
I didn't know what was going to happen during that argument!
Well, it looks like they're at opposite ends of the spectrum.
It's hard to say who's right or wrong.
Opposites, huh?
Opposite?!
I could turn this around...
I was too caught up with the idea of a perfect crime.
If I think along the lines of them not committing real crimes, then...
What's he saying?
I've got it!
How about this?!
If you put them together, that's morals and truth.
They fit the main characters, since they're the opposite of crime.
Doumoto Makoto.
Tokunaga Minoru.
And Annojo Mai!
They're not bad!
They're kinda cool, even!
They're great. Let's go with that!
You're awesome, Akito!
This is what happens when I get a flash of intuition.
So what about the title?
I haven't got that yet.
That's disappointing.
Well, we still have a few days before we need to finish.
It's a perfect manuscript!
The story and art are a given, but the protagonist's names are good, too!
And this title
Perfect Crime Party.
PCP!
The Japanese translation is Perfect Crime Party.
Right!
I was watching the news and I thought party as in political party would work well.
Party has a cheerful image, and since it's also used in video games, I thought it would make it seem fun.
A typical Takagi analysis.
The effort you two put into this really shows.
Yes! We'll definitely get first place for the first chapter!
We've put everything we possibly could into this to accomplish that!
I think aiming for that with this manuscript is more than reasonable.
The rest depends on Fukuda's one-shot, since that'll be in the issue, too.
Fukuda's one-shot?
I didn't hear about this!
This is why I said it was impossible to do a one-shot and KIYOSHI at the same time!
You gave me your permission!
That's why I'm helping you right now!
But this manga is good!
It's on fire!
Road Racer Buchigiri.
There was a super car boom.
Now I'll cause a super bike boom!
It's not bad to have a hobby.
It's all because you said that to me, Yuujirou.
I'm grateful to you for that.
Well, thanks a bunch!
But I'm pissed that it's in the same issue as Ashirogi's first chapter!
It means they want to compare it with a new serialization.
The editorial department put some thought into it.
I feel sorry for Ashirogi Muto!
I'll steal the top spot from them with this!
This is the finished sample copy.
It sure is nice to be on the front cover.
Fukuda's manga is good. It feels like a straightforward shounen.
He drives by girls on purpose to flip up their skirts.
Typical Fukuda.
Both his characters and story are typical mainstream.
I think it's good, too.
Mainstream...
This is gonna split the votes.
Fukuda's on a roll.
Making a manga about your hobby sure has a big effect.
But if it comes down to a new serialization and a one-shot, people are more likely to vote for the new serialization, right?
That trend does exist, but it's not a sure thing.
Buchigiri has a clear goal of becoming the number one racer.
The race scenes are showy and intense.
PCP has a lot of exposition and will look plain in comparison.
But the content is good, right?
Yes, it is.
Then...
That is, if they understand what's going on.
The majority of the readers are in their teens.
Buchigiri is easier for them to understand.
Aida, what ranking do you think PCP will get?
If it splits votes with Buchigiri,
then it may be hard for it to get ahead of the other popular manga.
It's all up to the readers.
Hey, the early results are in tomorrow, right?
I've told him to only let us know the final results.
What? But I really want to know!
Rankings, huh?
Moriya, not again
I would like to know as well.
I hope it does well.
Me, too.
It definitely will!
That's right.
PCP is the manga that must rank highly.
Will we place even with Niizuma?
Or even higher?
I can't seem to calm down.
Hey, what time will the final results be out?
Judging from last time, the call could come as late as 5 PM.
Mashiro, what time are your assistants coming?
4:30.
I hope he contacts us before they get here.
Then let's try calling him!
They may be out already!
He'll contact us as soon as they're out.
Just calm down.
But...
I read it!
I thought it was really good!
I especially liked the part where they spent two weeks preparing and
in just one night, made a message with flowers in the flower bed.
I wish someone would do that for me.
It'll be okay.
See, the assistants came already!
What? It's not even 4 yet.
Hattori?
I'm astonished.
It's the best by far.
422 votes.
A 150 vote lead over 2nd place.
1st place.
Hey, the door's open!
Yes!
We did it! We did it!
We did it!
We did it!
We did it!
Yeah, we did it!
We got first place!
By a landslide!
You did it, Saiko!
Let me in, too!
We did it!
422 votes... we haven't seen that since CROW!
CROW got 401.
And back then, there was no one-shot.
It got even more than +NATURAL did with its recent 1st place.
Natural only got 310 votes!
If there wasn't a one-shot, how would it have done?
Anyway, it's amazing.
2nd place with 268 votes?
Yeah, Ashirogi was just too overwhelming.
That's frustrating.
But it's a great vote tally.
Fukuda Shinta should make Buchigiri.
That's what the readers want.
You can wrap up KIYOSHI.
Make a serialization storyboard for Buchigiri!
Wow, isn't that great?
I got beat pretty bad by Ashirogi.
I'll pay them back with a serialization!
They did?
Yes, and by a landslide.
This was only because PCP and Buchigiri were good...
I'll rewrite it.
Huh?
I cannot afford to lose to Hattori and Takagi.
I'll rewrite everything you haven't sent to the printer yet!
So she said she wants to rewrite as much as possible.
Even what I'm drawing now?
Yes, if possible...
Akina said she'll make it better, right?
That's right.
Roger!
If she wasn't that fired up, I'd be disappointed!
If we don't make it better, Ashirogi will overtake us!
Under 10 and over 18?
Yeah.
The main demographic voted too, but those two age ranges were particularly conspicuous.
Let's analyze that and use it for reference going forward.
All right!
Let's set aside the difficult issues for now, since Hattori went out of his way to bring us a feast!
Before I realized it, I was at the grocery store...
Hattori.
Can I have the results chart?
No. Even though you're an author, I can't give it to you.
Do you want it as a keepsake?
No, I have someone I want to show it to.
Then I really can't give it to you.
Other authors' rankings are on here.
I have no problem with you telling your own rank to others, though.
Then...
Would you come with me?
Okay.
Is it okay for me to come, too?
There's no point if we aren't together.
This is...
Uncle...
This is what you wanted, but never managed to get.
A first place ranking in Weekly Shounen Jack.
It's not like I got this all by myself.
Many people helped me.
But Ashirogi Muto got 1st place!
So what if your first chapter got first place?
Of course it would.
Back when Fist of the North Star was popular, it got first place with more than 700 votes.
The real challenge starts from here, right?
When you get really popular and are truly number one,
come back here.
Of course I will!
Six months.
We'll see how it goes until their 25th chapter.
If they get such low rankings that it should be canceled, then after their 7th chapter, I won't hesitate.
And if they aren't head to head with CROW and +NATURAL by chapter 25,
I'll cancel it right then and there.
We managed to get 1st place in the rankings,
but the anime still goes on!
Can Ashirogi Muto make their dreams come true?
Bakuman: Season 3!
Please watch it!

The fight doesn't end until I fulfill my dream
I wonder how far I've come now?
In ten years, I'll be living the dream
It's the scenario I wrote for myself, so I'll have no regrets
But life isn't that easy, and it's full of obstacles
Still, I swear to myself that I won't ever back down
I have a dream that I absolutely want to achieve
So I fuel my passion until I succeed
There will be meetings and partings along the way
But I'll simply believe in my strength that you've taught me
And rise back up again and again and again
