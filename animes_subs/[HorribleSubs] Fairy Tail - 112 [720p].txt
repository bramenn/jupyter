What is this?
The grave... It's shining.
The rain?
What is this light?
One of the Fairy Tail's 3 Grand Spells, Fairy Glitter...
What does this mean?
The Words I Couldn't Say.
Damn you... What the hell are you after?
I asked you already. Where is Mavis's grave?
W-We don't know, either!
The grave of the founding Master?
It has something to do with the second test?
I see. I understand!
I'm sure it's something completely idiotic, but I suppose I'll ask anyway...
You want to become an S class wizard, too!
But we're not letting you into Fairy Tail!
I knew I shouldn't have asked...
H-Happy!
Cats should keep their damn mouths shut.
Was I asking you?
I don't give a crap about some exam or S class...
Stop treating me like an idiot.
You're the one that's treating us like idiots!
Lucy-san...
That grave is sacred to us!
Even if we did know where it was, we'd never tell you...
Lucy!
Why, you...
The sparkle of fairies...
Fairy Glitter!
It's said to be on par with Fairy Law.
One of your guild's 3 Grand Spells, yes?
What? I got no idea what you're talking about!
Natsu!
I-I'm being crushed!
That sparkle is a merciless light that cannot stand the presence of enemies.
We don't know!
Happy, hang in there!
I want that magic.
I am... the son of Igneel!
I won't... be grounded...
He's running!
Even in this gravity? Impressive!
It seems that spell is sealed at Mavis's grave...
Will you tell me where it is?
He jumped!
This guy sure hates to lose, doesn't he?
Iron Fist of the...
Not listening?
Natsu!
Oh, no...
W-What is he?
Is that Makarov lying over there?
Oh... I should just ask him.
Stop!
Just you try laying a hand on Gramps!
You won't get away with...
Stay down and shut up, you brats.
Or should I just crush you all right now?
Huh?
He's too strong!
What'll we do? What'll we do?
Somebody...
Somebody...!
What? What does this mean?
What I want isn't some spell!
What about the exam?
Master, where are you?!
Even though I got all this way...
Even though I thought I might finally become an S class wizard...
The last 12 years are riding on this exam...
12 years ago, my mother died from an illness,
and I found out in her will that my father was still alive.
I searched for him, and it led me to Fairy Tail.
My father's name is Gildarts.
Miss, what are you doing standing there?
F-Father...
Hurry back home now.
Stand there too long and your clothes will start smelling like booze.
Huh? Why?
Why didn't he realize who I am?
I missed my chance to tell him...
Hey there, squirt, you need something?
It's dangerous to hang around here, you know.
Um, when will Gildarts be coming back?
Wait, are you...
No, I'm...
The job he just headed out on...
Two, three days, a month... Who knows, really?
What? He'll be back before long.
Go ahead and drink some juice.
As I waited for my father to return, and visited again and again,
I ended up joining Fairy Tail.
The city split!
Cana, it's the one you've been waiting for, Gildarts!
You had to wait for two months, didn't you?
But...
Yo! Good work there.
I'm back, Master.
Seems like it went well.
I got a carrier pigeon with a note from the client expressing their thanks.
Oh, about that...
Great going, Gildarts.
We've got someone we want to introduce to you.
Oh, that's right!
It's our new recruit, Cana.
Treat her nice now, you hear?
U-Um...
Cana?
Oh, I remember now!
Sorry, didn't realize it was you.
You're the little girl I met at the entrance last time, right?
I see! So, you joined the guild?
Well, nice having you.
U-Um, you see...
Oh, sorry about this when you just got back and all...
But, could you come upstairs for a bit?
Seriously? What kind of request is it?
Father would only return occasionally...
And then, he'd head right out again on a job.
Yo!
You've sure grown, Cana.
U-Um...
Hey! You're going to miss the train again!
Crap!
See you later!
Father...
The words I couldn't say back then...
They grew larger and larger inside of me.
I learned the tarot in order to predict the days he would return.
Oh, you learned how to tell fortunes?
You didn't know?
Cana's fortunes are pretty spot on.
Oh? Then you should learn magic that uses cards.
Card Magic, huh? Sounds good to me!
Card Magic? Me?
But, I can't do magic...
The heart!
Everything begins from a heart that believes, Cana.
Fortune, faith, and prayer are all a form of magic.
Miracles where only those who believe can sense them...
That's right.
Believe in the existence of magic, and believe in your own power...
Only those who naturally believe in both can use magic.
Heart...
And so I learned how to use Card Magic.
I thought if I could learn how to use magic, I could get a little closer to my father.
But he was popular with everyone, and the number one wizard in the guild.
I couldn't even be compared to him.
He was always a shining star.
Without being able to say the truth, time passed,
and at some point I became afraid to say the truth.
The turning point was the S Class Wizard Advancement Exam.
Me?
Do your best.
Right!
I decided...
If I passed the test, I would tell my father the truth.
But... I failed four years in a row.
Erza and Mira, who entered the guild after me, passed one after another.
I was just the leftovers.
I'll never live up to my father.
That's why I decided this would be the last time.
I was thinking of quitting the guild.
Meaning that if I fail this time, I have no right to be Gildarts' daughter.
I'll quit the guild, and leave the city.
I'll be your partner, Cana!
I'm not gonna let you quit the guild!
Because I'm going to make you an S class wizard!
Help, help, help!
What's this card?
It's a card to let me know if you're in trouble, Lucy.
If this card starts flashing during the exam,
I'll come to rescue you no matter how far away I am.
What the hell have I been doing?
No!
It shouldn't have turned out like this!
I never intended to betray my friends...
It's too late for me...
I don't care if I can't become an S class wizard...
I don't care if I can't tell my father how I feel...
That's how much... I want to protect my friends!
I don't need anything else!
Just as long as everyone else is safe!
It doesn't matter if I'm no longer in the guild!
Because no matter where I am,
my heart will always be in the same place!
So, please...
Lend me the power to protect the guild.
Because I...
In that case, you have nothing to fear.
Mistakes are not shackles that halt one from stepping forward.
Rather, they are that which sustain and grow one's heart.
That voice...
Now, go.
I give you the Fairy Glitter.
Master Mavis...
Understood.
This may be my final battle.
I owe you big time for these past 12 years, everyone at Fairy Tail!
This way?
Wait for me, Lucy! I'm coming for you!
One of Fairy Tail's 3 Grand Spells, Fairy Glitter...
With this magic, I can defeat any enemy!
I'm going to protect the guild!
Is it you?!
Cana!
Cana!
Cana-san!
You're safe!
Aye!
You ain't gonna hurt my friends anymore!
Fairy...
Light?
What's that magic?
You're kidding me...
That magic you have...
Don't tell me... Fairy Glitter?
Lucy... I'm sorry I left you behind.
I don't have any excuse for it.
I'm really sorry.
Just, believe me now.
If I can hit him with this magic, I can beat him!
Wow!
Did you get it at the grave?
What?!
S-She was at the grave?
Don't tell me the exam...
Let's put that aside for now.
Help me to beat this guy, Natsu.
Keep his attention while I gather up the magic power...
There is no one who can move under my power of gravity.
I never would have thought the magic I was searching for would just show up in front of me.
Fairy Glitter.
I will be taking that spell.
Only those in our guild can use this magic!
You won't be able to use it!
If you trace back the origins of magic, all magic first began with a single spell.
Every type of magic originally came from just one.
Just one magic?
I feel like I've heard that somewhere before...
Those who get close enough to the depths of magic are able to use every type of magic.
Cana!
Move!
Let me ask you, instead...
Can a little girl like you actually use Fairy Glitter?
Of course I can!
It's an extremely difficult spell that gathers and concentrates sunlight and moonlight.
There's no way someone like you could use it!
Don't worry. I'll take good care of that magic for you.
Natsu-san.
He's so stupidly powerful... But in this gravity even he...
Wait, that's not it!
Roar of the...
He did it?
Outta my way, trash!
Nice, Natsu!
Go!
I can use this magic...
Gather to me, O River of Light led by the Fairies...
Impossible! That's...
The sky is shining...
No, it's from the other side...
The stars themselves are shining!
Shine down! To wipe out the fangs of evil!
Fairy Glitter!
What incredible light!
That's one of the guild's 3 Grand Spells!
Disappear!
Fall!
You call that Fairy Glitter?
Don't make me laugh.
It doesn't matter how powerful the magic. If the user is worthless, this is the result.
No...
Did you know?
I can still take that magic even after I kill you.
I didn't have enough power...
Cana!
Don't!
Please!
I wasn't able to fly today, again.
You will fall down to hell.
Gildarts!
No way...
It's Gildarts!
F-Father...
The big tree on this island is called the Tenrou tree, I hear!
It's the island where Fairy Tail's founding master rests, right?
Is it some kind of fairy tree, I wonder?
Maybe a fairy of the founding master will show up or something?
Ooh, I wanna fight it!
Natsu, do you have anything in your head other than eat, sleep, and fight?
Next time: The Tenrou Tree.
Sure I do!
Sneak into Lucy's house.
Play pranks on Lucy.
Lucy...
Sounds like this might go on a while... Can you write it down?
