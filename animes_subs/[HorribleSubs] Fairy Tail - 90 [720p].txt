Reporting...
The rebelling human vermin have connected the Dragon Chain Cannon to the giant lacrima
and are trying to crash it into Extalia.
Nichiya-sama, as well as the majority of the Royal Guard, have been turned into a lacrima,
and are now being held captive in the Royal City.
At this rate, Extalia...
How incredibly reckless!
Fearsome indeed!
To think they would go so far...
Furthermore, one of the Fallen and a human have appeared in the town,
and are spreading the word to abandon Extalia and escape...
They're causing a riot outside of the castle... How should we deal with the situation?
Lead me there.
What?!
My Queen!
What are you intending to do?
The time...
The time has come.
The Boy Back Then.
Gajeel!
Hurry and destroy the lacrima and turn everyone back to normal!
I won't make it...
It's accelerating, damn it!
Oh, no!
Hurry!
We can't let it collide!
Hang in there, Legy-pyon!
It's no use! We're not coming even close to stopping it!
Everyone, release your magic power!
Please, stop!
Stop!
Natsu!
Um...
Help me out, partner!
Aye, sir!
We'll finish this later, cat!
Running for it?
I ain't runnin' or hidin'!
I'm gonna stop this thing and finish this!
Stop it? You're going to stop it?
The entire floating island connected to the Dragon Chain?
That's a fool's errand!
There is no tomorrow for us.
We have nothing left!
Hey!
After this...
And then I'm gonna make you my cat.
It's no use, they're going to hit!
Brace for it!
Damn it all!!
Not yet!
Don't give up, Happy!
Aye, sir!
Gajeel?
Why haven't you returned everyone else to normal like us?
You have to hurry!
That black cat got in my way!
It doesn't matter. It'd take too much time now!
We have no choice but to stop it!
We're totally gonna stop it, damn it!
Coco, why are you...
Lily!
I realized that I don't need eternal magic power!
I'd rather have eternal smiles!
What foolishness!
Hurry up and escape, Coco!
No matter what you do, you'll never stop this island!
We'll stop it...
Even if this body crumbles to bits, I'll stop it just with my soul!!
Aye, sir!
Dear...
What the hell is goin' on?
The Royal Army is attacking!
The humans are attacking!
They're planning on rebelling against the Exceed?
Those damn humans don't realize our Queen's power...
You'll learn some respect today!
I'm sure our Queen's magic will come out anytime now!
Sure, but I hope we counterattack soon, or...
Don't be afraid! Our Queen is with us!
The lacrima hit...
It's not done yet. It seems to have stopped at the edge of the island.
I'm sorry, Carla...
It wasn't supposed to turn out like...
What are you saying? It's too early to give up hope!
Everyone, listen!
You're still here, you Fallen?!
Nady-sama?
Carla!
T-Throwing stones... is... dangerous...
But she's a Fallen...
These people came here to warn us of danger!
But because no one listened to them, it's turned out like this!
What are you saying?
With our Queen's magic, something like this is no problem!
Now, the Queen will...
Uh... Um...
Enough, Nady.
My Queen!
It's the Queen!
My Queen!
That person is the Queen?
Everyone, please raise your heads.
Then listen calmly to what I am about to say.
Why is the Queen here?
'Cause I bet she's gonna do some incredibly destructive magic...
Shh! Quiet!
Right now, Extalia is on the brink of complete destruction.
It is a fate we can no longer resist.
Therefore, I have made a decision.
You're gonna wipe out all the humans, right?
Stay silent and listen!
W-What is it, Queen?
I decided that I must tell everyone the truth.
I am simply an Exceed.
I am hardly a Queen, and most definitely not a god.
I am an Exceed, the same as you all.
N-No!
I have no power to fight the humans.
As you can see, I am one-winged.
For an Exceed, one's wings grow and shrink by one's own magic power.
With both wings, one can display one's true magic power.
My magic power is extremely weak.
I am so sorry I hid all of this...
You are Wendy-san and Carla-san, yes?
I must apologize to you as well.
This is all my fault.
Please, do not hate me, everyone.
What is going on?
The ones who created the Queen were we elders.
We are a very weak race.
Since long ago, we have had terrible things done to us by the humans.
Therefore, to protect ourselves, we made the humans believe that we had power.
Then, for all Exceeds to gain back their self-confidence,
we had everyone in Extalia believe that they were protected by the power of God.
The power of God was nothing more than a bluff known only to us few Exceeds...
At first, the humans didn't believe us,
but before long they began to fear the power of God...
For example, the Human Control that decides when humans die...
It's all actually after the fact.
We don't decide what humans are killed...
We don't have such power, of course.
The only thing we have is that Chagot can see a little bit into the future.
She can see people's deaths.
When she was correct, we made people think it was she who killed them.
It's a lie!
Our Queen is God!
Chagot-sama, hurry and destroy the humans!
We were deceived!
Carla?
Whether or not you actually have power, you ordered me to kill my friends!
That I know to be the truth!
Chagot never gave such an order!
It must have been the humans who used the Queen to...
No!
You placed strange memories, messing with my head!
You ordered me to eliminate the Dragon Slayers, yes?
Since before I even hatched!
That's...
N-N-N-N-No! There's a really long, important reason for that...
Even if there is a reason, I'll never forgive you!
Carla, now is really not the time...
Carla-san is completely correct.
You had no sin in this.
And yet, I made you bear the most painful feelings of all.
Q-Queen!
Please pass judgment on me for my sins by your own hand!
Pass judgment by your own hands!
You, who love both the Exceed and the Humans, have such a right!
Carla...
Queen!
Queen!
Now everyone, get away from here!
My fate lies alongside Extalia as it falls to ruin!
Carla...
Stop this!
We don't want to leave you...
I'll stay here!
This is the end of our history...
That's why the Queen felt she had to tell us everything...
But I want to be with you, Queen!
I want to stay here, too!
Everyone, you can't! This country is fated for destruction!
Carla!!
How dare...
How dare you just give up?!
This is your country, right?
Can't you do anything without a god or queen?!
Didn't you try your best to live on, even if it was a lie?
So why are you giving up so easily?
So what if you're weak?
If everyone works together, you can accomplish anything!
This country will not be destroyed!
Because it's my homeland!
It isn't going anywhere!
I won't give up.
I'll stop it, no matter what!
Carla!
I'll go, too.
Nady...
After all, I love this country!
I think I'm gonna be crushed!
Hold on!
We have to stop this... We have to!
It's pointless...
This isn't something humans can do anything about, no matter how strong they are!
Carla?
I'm not going to give up... on Fairy Tail... or on Extalia!
I'm gonna protect them both!
You're...
I wanna protect it, too!
And I bet everyone else does, too...
This is... What's going on?
That light...
We'll protect our country ourselves!
We came through dangerous times and protected our country and its people!
For our Queen!
Wendy-san, Carla-san... We're sorry about before!
Everyone, we've got to do something about this now!
Chagot, with your wing, you can't...
No, I must!
I must do what I can!
What dream is this?
Extalia has joined together as one...
Lily, why did you save a human?
Because the child was seriously wounded...
Fool! Bringing that thing to Extalia is a grave offense!
However, I must help the injured, even if they be human.
You didn't forget the rules, right, Lily?
You are now made one of the Fallen, and are banished from Extalia!
What?! For this?!
What?
Don't worry... It wasn't your fault I was banished.
First thing I must do is escort you home.
Queen!
Lily!
My Queen...
Are you tired from lying?
I'm sorry... I...
As am I...
No matter how much I may resent it, Extalia is my country!
Lily...
But, it's too late.
Even with this many Exceed, they can't stop it.
I'm sorry, everyone! This is my fault!
I could have stopped them!
I could have stopped the humans!
Your feelings... I know your feelings will get through!
Stop!!
Everyone, go for it!
Push!
We can do it!
We ain't gonna lose!
We shall ne'er give up!
We're gonna stop it, for sure!
We'll push, too!
Aye, sir!
Aye, sir!
Aye, aye, sir!
Please, stop!!
The lacrima is being pushed back..
What?
Carla?
Look at that.
That's...
The lacrima has disappeared...
The Dragon Chain Cannon's chain as well...
W-What's going on?
It has been returned to Earthland.
Mystogan!
I searched for the remaining tear from the giant Anima to return everything to the way it was.
I apologize for my lateness.
Without everyone's help, I wouldn't have made it.
I give you my thanks.
The way it was?
That's right.
The lacrima has passed once again through the Anima and returned to how it was in Earthland.
Everything is over.
We did it?
We protected Extalia!
Lily, you saved my life.
I am glad I was able to protect your homeland...
Thank you very much...
The Prince is back!
Prince?
Black cat!
Lily!
This isn't over!
This isn't over yet!
Hey, Happy, there's a dragon-looking thing out there...
Wasn't there something like that before?
I think you're talking about the Dragonoid... But this one looks different.
They're both just fake dragons, right?
I'll bust it up like I did the last one!
Be careful. If it's just coming out now, there must be something to it.
Next time: Dragon Sense!
What's with this thing? Magic doesn't work on it?
Look, Natsu! It's changing color!
I guess this isn't dragon slaying, it's chameleon slaying.
