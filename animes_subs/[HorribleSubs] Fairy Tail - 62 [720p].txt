Nirvana has started to move, and it's heading toward Wendy's guild, Caitshelter!
Yes...
And we faced off against the Poison Dragon, Cobra!
Yes...!
But you know, doesn't old man Jura kinda look like a potato?
I am not a potato!
I'm kinda... My body doesn't feel so...
Is it his poison?
Damn it...
I can't move... either...
Plus... I'm on transportation...
By the pride of the Six Generals, I will defeat you!
Jura, the Tenth Saint!
Damn it... I can't move...
I can hear it... I can hear the end of the life of an Old Generation Dragon Slayer!
Enough, Cobra.
B-Brain?
What are you...
You did well.
Rest in peace.
In the end, nothing more than a fake Dragon Slayer...
I have no need for him as one of the six generals that will crush the official guilds.
Trash!
Oops. Did you hear that?
Damn you...
Damn you!
My prayer...
I only wanted to hear the voice of my one friend...
Cubellios...
Cobra...
Weren't you... his ally?
Ally? I can gather as many as I wish shortly.
Using Nirvana's power, that is.
You can't call those allies.
They're just puppets!
Now, now... Don't get testy.
I have taken an interest in your power.
I suspect you know what I mean by that.
I will make you my first puppet slave!
Those with the stronger ideals will win!
That is what Jura said!
No... I don't wanna lose...
If I lose, then Father will abandon me...
I don't wanna lose!
Running is futile!
Yes...!
My Heaven's Eye can see through everything!
I have seen!
Liquid Ground!
At this rate, I'm going to be abandoned...
Father... will abandon me!
That may be for the best, yes?
Today, Oracion Seis will be no more!
There he is!
Natsu!
What happened?
It's'cause this is transportation...
Everyone...
Happy!
Cat-dono, you are also unharmed?
Cat-dono?
Save Natsu...
He's being taken away...
Half of the Six Generals are finished.
Their stars have fallen.
Starting now, I will create a new set of Generals.
Including this one.
I figured this would happen eventually. Finally getting scouted by a Dark Guild, huh?
Natsu isn't gonna do what you say!
Nirvana will soak this boy's heart in darkness,
and he will become nothing but my loyal servant.
Hell no, I won't!
You still have that much strength left?
He does not seem so well.
He gets extreme motion sickness.
Hurry up... and beat... this guy...
Stop... this thing...
I'm not doin' it for you, but sure.
Yeah!
Stop?
Nirvana?
Not even possible.
This city will shortly reach its first destination.
We will arrive at Caitshelter.
That's Wendy and Carla's guild!
But why?
Tell us your purpose. Why do you aim for Wendy-dono's guild?
This ultra-inversion magic can change a guild of light into one of darkness in an instant.
I can't wait.
I suspect you'll see true hell.
We can't let this guy off!
This bastard is gettin' to me!
Did you not hear me?
Tell us your purpose!
I have no words for pitiful weaklings like you!
I will become the judge ruling over light and darkness!
Bow down before me!
This man needs to be dealt with.
Dude...
It seems like there is no talking with him.
Begone, worms!
W-What is this magic power?
Stand. I will not let you rest until you say why you are targeting Caitshelter.
Wait, could this old guy...
This is someone with the title of Wizard Saint, just like our master.
I see... You surprised me for a moment there.
I suppose the distinction of being one of the Wizard Saints is not just for show.
There are many other guilds closer than Caitshelter.
There must be some reason why you head there specifically.
There is no need for those that will shortly be dead to know!
Dark Rondo!
Rockiron Wall!
Whoa! That's amazing! And actually kinda scary...
Do you understand how futile this battle is now?
Tell me the reason you aim for Caitshelter.
And what will you do if you know?
I said it was futile!
Oh, is that so?
I have you now.
Oh, no!
Dude, behind you!
Dark Capriccio!
The rocks are bending!
It's futile.
Dark Capriccio is a piercing magic.
It will cut right through those damn rocks!
The Rockiron Wall won't work against that!
He's got a way to pierce through,
but being able to dodge it is impressive, too!
You should take back what you said before.
It is not futile.
Now, what will you do, Wizard Saint?
Dark Capriccio!
Rockiron Wall!
The same thing again?
Perhaps that's what is futile!
My Dark Capriccio will eventually turn you to dust!
That would be good if it were true.
I will finish this. And in a big way!
Dark Capriccio Scream!
Rockiron Wall Continuous Chain!
Jura, run!
He's trapped in rocks.
Supreme Rock Shatter!
Even while withstanding such fierce attacks, he noticed he could use the shattered pieces of rocks!
No wonder even Lyon treats him with respect.
Heck yeah! That guy's the boss of Oracion Seis, right?
We won!
Now... Tell me the reason you are aiming for Wendy-dono's guild.
Wait, shouldn't we just stop it?
Do it for me, please...
I cannot believe that I... was... defeated...
Midnight... I leave the rest to you.
The Six Generals will never be defeated.
When the six prayers vanish,
he will...
He?
And hey, didn't one of those symbols on his face just disappear?
Please don't freak me out like that.
I'm gonna have nightmares about this now!
Everyone!
Wendy!
I figured that all that ruckus was you people.
Carla!
This city...
I think it might be heading toward our guild!
Seems like it. But don't worry now.
The snake charmer's defeated over there.
Then...
It's probably Brain here that was manipulating Nirvana.
So since we defeated him, the city should stop, right?
I don't like this.
In the end, we never found out why he was heading for Caitshelter.
Maybe there wasn't any particular reason for it.
When the six prayers vanish,
he will...
There are still some things left unsolved, but it is over now.
No, it ain't!
Hurry up and stop this thing!
Natsu-san!
Is he poisoned?
The he-cat, too!
You are so pitiful.
Aye...
You are also dreaming.
In the dead of night...
Magic cannot hit me.
Midnight isn't even injured?
I've surpassed my father as the strongest wizard.
My prayer...
My brother!
I wanted to see your face, one more time...
Five prayers have vanished.
Midnight... Do not vanish, no matter what.
That is my prayer.
What the hell?
What in the world...?
There's nothing that looks like controls at all!
Then, how can we stop it?
Damn it!
I thought it would stop if we defeated Brain...
We were naive! Now we have no idea how to stop it!
What should I do? I cast a spell to cure poison, but he's still...
Natsu can't handle transportation.
So pitiful!
I'm gonna hurl...
Motion sickness?
Aye!
In that case...
Maybe a spell to cure his sense of equilibrium will work.
Troia.
I'm baaack!
Fine! Totally fine!
Thank goodness.
I'm glad it worked.
You rock, Wendy!
Please teach me that magic!
It's Sky Magic... That's impossible.
This doesn't feel like transportation at all!
Okay! Lucy, summon a boat or train Spirit!
I don't have one like that!
And anyway, this isn't the time!
Get with the picture, would ya?
We don't know how to stop it. As you can see, there's nothing here.
But Hot Eye... I mean, Richard, said that this was the place it was controlled from.
I do not believe that Richard-dono would lie.
Besides having it stop or not,
hasn't anyone noticed something even more peculiar?
There's no controls, and no one here in the King's Summit.
Brain has been defeated.
So why is it still moving?
Could it be operating on auto-pilot?
Nirvana has already been set to fire!
Our... guild...
Don't worry.
Your guild ain't goin' anywhere.
Let me do you this favor.
I'll stop it, no matter what.
Nirvana will not stop.
As long as I am here.
Natsu, you don't really bring the gravitas when you talk, you know?
What? I say cool stuff all the time!
Like what?
Uh, oh yeah, that!
Like I'm all fired up! and stuff.
Let's do this! Stuff like that.
That's just your catch phrases!
Next time: It is Your Words
I meant words that people remember in their hearts!
I'll kick your ass! Yeah, I guess not.
All people will remember from that is the trauma.
