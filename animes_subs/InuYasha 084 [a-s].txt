Sacred Jewel shards...
We were in search of Naraku,
when a ghastly demon came afterus.
Just then...
Koga saved me.
But a young girl from the Wolf-Demon Tribe appeared.
You promised me...
Don't overdo it.
If itgets too hard,
I'll make you my wife, Ayame.
l-Is that true?
D-Did I really say that?
That demon...
Did Naraku send that as a decoy?
We'll find out once we capture it.
It may know Naraku's whereabouts, too.
That's afterwe save Kagome!
Be safe, Kagome!
Then the elder of the Wolf-Demon Tribe is yourgrandfather?
I call him Gramps.
But there must be a reason
for coming down the mountain like this?
It's only recently...
but a strange demonic aura came down from the northern mountain.
Strange demonic aura?
Gramps said it smells of a demon.
Demon?
Uh-huh...
And around that time,
in-fighting among the Wolf-Demon Tribes
in the east and north, and south and west increased.
So Gramps decided to marry me off to one of the strong young ones
to build up an alliance.
Huh?! Apolitical marriage?
Luckily, Koga and I were already promised.
I said I don't remember!
Gramps thought that Koga would be able to get followers.
And I didn't mind marrying, if it's to Koga.
So it wasn't just a political marriage.
Damn!
Getting all worked up over a stupid demonic aura!
Yourrole may be to make peace...
but all you gotta do is crack theirheads together
and make them see some sense!
It's not thateasy!
In orderto bring the tribes together, we need their trust!
You have to get married and be settled.
Then I'm not suited forthat.
Koga!
What I want to do more than anything right now,
is to get Naraku's head!
I don't have time for anything else!
No matter what?
Shut up!
Go back to the mountain!
Koga!
Ayame...
Stop listening only to what the elder says.
Do what you want to do.
Huh?
Ayame... That's the end of this subject.
Say, Koga!
This demonic aura?!
Demonic aura?
That Inuyasha!
He must have let the demon go!
I can smell it... it's real close.
Huh?
Koga, let's go back to Inuyasha and the others.
Don't worry, Kagome. I'll protect you.
I appreciate your words...
But this isn't the time for such words!
Huh? Koga keeps saying he loves her.
But this Kagome, could she?
Hey demon! I'll take you on.
Besides, I need to ask you a question!
Which way?!
Overthere?
Huh?!
The Hair is attacking!
To stall us?
It doesn't want to let us pass.
Inuyasha!
Go to Kagome!
Awright!
Kagome, wait for me!
You won't get away now!
I'll devour you all... Sacred Jewel shards and all!
Ayame... I don't have any right to ask you this.
But I'll leave Kagome in your care.
In my care? Me?
Kagome, wait there with Ayame.
Koga!
You're just huge, that's all!
Just watch!
Take this!
Now that you've caught up with me...
Now you can tell me!
Where is Naraku?!
The hair's falling out!
Why you!
Koga!
Strike him!
A sacred arrow? Is Kagome... a priestess?
D-Damn!
Are you all right, Ayame?
This demon!
Why don't you get away?
What?
Koga is doing his best to protect you.
Koga isn't like that.
Koga is fighting to protect both you and me.
Huh?!
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!
Inuyasha!
You're all right, Kagome?
I'm okay.
Inuyasha? He's with Kagome?
Koga, what're you doing?!
Putting Kagome in danger like this!
Shaddup!
It's only because you stupidly let the demon escape!
I'll protect Kagome! So stay outta this, Wolf!
I'll protect Kagome!
But you can't!
Koga, Inuyasha is here. Don't overexert yourself.
K-Kagome!
Huh?
Is Koga...
Watch out, Inuyasha.
Don't get tangled up in that demon's hair.
I'll destroy him in one blow with my Wind Scar.
Damn mutt! Coming into the picture like this!
I'm gonna get the demon!
Koga... Could this be...
an unrequited love?
I'll devour you, shard and all!
Hurry, Inuyasha!
We have to save him!
Me?
You're the only one who can!
Hurry before he's eaten! Hurry!
I don't care what happens to Koga.
But I can't let you have the Sacred Jewel shard!
Huh? The hair only scattered away!
What?!
Inuyasha!
No one will get in my way now!
I've finally been...
Damn!
freed from Naraku!
Wha?!
I'll use the Sacred Jewel's power...
and get back my former self.
What?
Kagome!
Kagome!
You're all right?
Everyone!
Who is thatgirl?
She's Ayame.
Koga's fiancee.
Huh? Fiancee?!
We can talk later.
But what is that demon?
That demon said that he had been freed from Naraku.
Huh?
You! Just what do you mean?
That Naraku... he abandoned me and the castle.
He wasn't an incarnation that Naraku created out of his body?
Naraku didn't need him anymore?
Well... he certainly doesn't look very useful.
I shoulda known...
You're too ugly even for Naraku's demon.
What a pity, Koga.
You mean all this time,
you've been fooling around with trash like this?
Damn it all.
Ayame!
Can't be helped. I'll protect you, too.
So stay there and watch.
Mutt, I'll play with you later.
W-What!
Hey, Demon!
You cried about being abandoned, huh?
Does that mean...
you don't know where Naraku is?!
Huh?!
Koga!
Don't be hasty, Koga!
We still have questions.
Now then, Demon... Tell us all you know.
Or else...
It's useless to search.
Naraku has escaped to a place
where no one can touch him.
Huh?!
Where no one can touch him?!
Too bad.
That's all I know.
Huh?!
Naraku cut me off in the midst of things.
I don't know Naraku's plans beyond that.
Serves you right!
It seems he's telling the truth.
Damn! He's no help!
Huh! Can't be helped if you don't know.
However...
There's one thing this trash of a demon is good for.
Why you!
Koga!
Ayame!
She purified the demonic aura!
It's the spiritual power of the iris.
I'll devour you!
- Koga! - Ayame!
They've both been devoured!
Koga! Ayame!
Damn, I can't use the Wind Scar!
I've eaten the Sacred Jewel shards!
As if you can kill me!
Koga! Your arm!
All because I jumped in.
Hey!
Koga!
So you finally caught up.
You two, rememberthe scent.
And make sure all the wolves rememberit.
So you'll use all the wolves to track the scent?
And search for Naraku high and low?
If wolves were able to sniff that Naraku out,
I'd have done it long ago!
Huh?!
Koga!
Hey!
Kagome, I have to go now.
But...
When we next meet, I'll have Naraku's head as a gift.
That Koga... She doesn't love him!
Yet he's trying so hard.
N- No... thanks!
Don't look like that, Kagome.
You're the woman who's gonna be my wife.
What?!
Ahh! Hey wait, Koga!
You promised long, long before you met me...
that you'd marry Ayame.
And yet you're telling me this?
That's something... I don't remember.
But look...
The night of the lunarrainbow...
Don't you remember anything?!
A rainbow...
Huh?!
Huh?!
I'll make you my wife...
when you come down from the mountain.
Look!
A lunarrainbow...
Sorry, but I still don't remember.
Koga, you saw the rainbow, didn't you?
I said I don't remember any rainbow.
Ayame was...
still really... young, right?
Never mind about the past.
I understand now that you have to go afterthis Naraku.
Is Kagome part of a love triangle with Koga and Ayame?
I don't think so...
I think Ayame came to get Koga.
But Koga loves only Kagome.
Unlike some otherguy, he's sticking to one and only one.
What're you doing, Inuyasha?!
Shaddup!
Until you complete your vendetta,
I'll manage something with the elder.
Okay.
But, I don't plan to give you up.
Rememberthat!
Huh?!
I'm the only one who can be your wife.
M-My woman has to be able to sense the Sacred Jewel shards!
Kagome can see it!
See it?
The Sacred Jewel shards?
Then I'll make myself be able to see it, too!
Make yourself able to see it?
As if you can!
- I can! - You can't!
I can!
You can't, I said!
W-What?
You just wait and see.
H-Hey!
See ya!
Hey, Miroku...
If you train, can you make yourself see the Sacred Jewel shards like Kagome?
Impossible, I think.
But I think she's going to do it.
She's full of confidence, too.
That fool Ayame!
Hey Koga!
Now that that's settled...
Why don't you leave those shards that are in yourlegs here?!
No way!
See ya, Kagome!
Good bye!
Wait, Koga!
Damn!
But Inuyasha...
I think Koga's idea about using his wolves makes sense.
It's too simple!
If the scent was a problem, why did Naraku leave his trash?
The source of his scent!
Isn't that too careless?
Oh, you're right.
In otherwords, Naraku...
is confident that he'll never be located.
Isn't that so?
That makes a lot of sense.
And?
Huh?
Not huh.
Where do you think Naraku went?
Tell us yourthoughts.
You figure the rest out yourself.
So he didn't figure it out yet.
I gotta keep it together...
But... Inuyasha is right.
The place where Naraku escaped to...
The place where no one can touch him...
How do we locate such a place?
We were close to the river on that night, too.
I don't feel like I'll lose to Naraku.
But there's no guarantee that I'll be alive
afterl take my revenge.
Ayame, forget about the night of the lunar rainbow.
I won't forget.
I won't everforget that you protected me.
Even if the rainbow fades.
Damn it all!
Just when I'm able to break through Naraku's barrier...
Uh-huh...
But we'll find Naraku.
If we all search together.
All?!
Are you still gonna rely on Koga?
Even his fiancee from the Wolf-Demon Tribe left him.
And you're gonna depend on a guy like that?!
Huh? Are you stilljealous?
l-I'm not jealous!
You're not jealous?
Who cares about that?
You're the one who started it!
Come on... Just continue what you were saying.
Forget it!
I won't!
If only Inuyasha could be a bit more forthright...
like Ayame who loves Koga.
A lunarrainbow...
Huh?
Ain't no such thing as a rainbow at night.
There is.
To people who can see it.
Really?
Ever since Naraku disappeared,
all these demons who've lain low have begun to act up.
Thanks to them, Demon Slayers have lots of work.
But that means more competition.
How can that old woman exorcist endure this demonic aura?
She must be really powerful... or really dense.
Let's clean this up and go home.
Next on Inuyasha: The Evil Within Demon's Head Castle
A beautiful princess! Leave her to me.
- Okay, okay. - Okay!
