Hey!
Deku has a Quirk, right?
You saw that extraordinary strength, didn't you?
Did he dare trick me?!
That damn nerd!
He's a piece of work...
But...
Now, let's start the indoor person-to-person combat training with Team A and Team D!
Come Deku...
I won't do so much damage that this fight gets stopped, but I'm gonna get close!
Wow, he's like a martial arts master!
What's with this guy?
Did he read my moves?
My Deku isn't always going to mean useless!
Kacchan...
Because Kacchan and I lived in the same neighborhood...
Let's go kill the enemy!
Okay!
O-Okay...!
He was the type who could do anything he tried his hand at...
Good or bad aside...
But...
Even though you're scared...
That's what I...
All men are not created equal.
This was the reality I learned about society at the young age of four.
Hey, Bakugo!
Give me your status!
What happened?
Just shut up and defend.
I'm really angry right now!
I'm not asking about how you feel!
Hey!
He hung up...
Going off on his own like that...
What is wrong with him?!
Jeez!
What was Bakugo saying?
Can't tell with just the cameras in a fixed position and no sound.
He's talking to his partner over the small wireless radio.
You can bring that plus the building's floor plan...
Once you wrap this around your opponent, it shows that you have captured them.
The time limit is 15 minutes,
and the heroes don't know where the nuclear weapon is located, right?
Yes!
The heroes are clearly at a disadvantage here!
Heroes should be able to turn the tables on whatever predicament they're in.
Besides, didn't Mr. Aizawa tell you, too?
You know
Here we go
Plus Ultra!
Monsieur, Bakugo is
Uraraka, go!
Looking away?
You must be sure of yourself.
The capture tape?!
Hero notebook number 10...
I'm glad I got to see Eraser Head's moves in person!
What's next?
If it's Kacchan, he'll be impatient
and swing with his right again!
I was right!
That guy's amazing!
He's not even using his Quirk fighting against the guy who finished first in the entrance exam!
He was always good at reacting quickly in a crisis.
He spent years writing his notes and internalizing them.
That fanboy knowledge...
He kicked first this time to keep me from predicting his moves.
He's being cautious now.
Come back here, Deku!
I can't get close to him as easily anymore.
I need a plan.
Hey!
You tricked me, didn't you?!
Was it fun tricking me all this time?!
Huh?!
You have got a flashy Quirk there, don't you?!
Try and get me with it!
'Cause I'm way above you!
He seems real angry.
It's scary!
I had heard from young Midoriya that young Bakugo thinks well of himself, but this is too much.
He completely ignored Uraraka and shot at me.
I knew it.
If they were going to send an advance guard, it would have been better to send Iida, who has more mobility,
and I'm sure he knows that.
That probably means he's running wild on his own, and the two of them aren't working together.
In the first place, our chances of winning are lowest if we have a head-to-head battle with those two.
If Uraraka and I both went to the hideout, that's what would happen.
And even if the two of us stayed here to fight Kacchan,
we're in danger of running out of time.
This is fine.
All that's left is for Uraraka to find the weapon and Iida,
and then I'll head over for a 2-on-1 fight.
That's how we can win.
That's assuming I can beat Kacchan, though.
It's fine.
As long as I'm careful of his palms, I can do this.
Where are you?!
You damn nerd!
And...
You're Quirkless!
How can you even stand in the same ring as me?
It's not like I'm trying to compete with you or anything!
Believe me!
I take back... everything I said!
That's why...
I'm going...!
My Deku means You can do it!
He's just a pebble!
Wow, Kacchan!
This is easy!
Ow!
Izuku, you really can't do anything, can you?
You can read the characters for Izuku as Deku, you know.
Kacchan, you can read?
You can't?
And Deku means someone who can't do anything!
Ohhh?
Ohhh?
Stop that...
Why don't you know?
Kacchan, how many times did yours skip?
Seven!
Wow!
As expected!
What about you, Deku?
Z-Zero times...
Why can't you do it?
Wow!
Lucky!
That's so cool!
Wow, that's an amazing Quirk!
It really is!
It's a flashy Quirk just right for a hero, right, Katsuki?
Oh, I see!
I'm amazing!
No one is...
You're so lucky, Kacchan.
Your Quirk's so cool!
I hope I get mine soon, too.
No matter what Quirk you get, you'll never beat me.
He's just a pebble!
Hey, did you hear?
Deku doesn't have a Quirk.
What? Really?
Yeah, it's called being Quirkless.
That's so lame.
Too bad for him.
He's so weird!
Don't worry about it, Izuku.
You're the least amazing, Deku.
Forward march, members of the Bakugo Hero Agency!
Kacchan!
Hey, are you okay?
He's fine.
Kacchan's real strong!
See?
I was fine!
Hurry up and get back up here!
'Kay, no problem!
Nothing was wrong!
Are you all right?
Can you stand?
It would have been bad if you hit your head.
Don't look at me with that face!
You looked like you were asking for help...
Stop it...!
I'm...
I'm way above him!
Found it.
Now I just have to tell Deku and hide until he gets here.
Baku go is a natural at being bad, but that fits this training perfectly.
Then I must also devote myself to being a villain.
That's right.
This is another trial to turn me into a man who will not bring shame to the Iida family.
Become a villain!
Be dyed with evil in order to become a hero!
I am...
He's taking this so seriously!
Have you arrived, Uraraka?
I knew that you would come here alone the instant Bakugo ran off by himself.
Your Quirk allows you to make the objects you touch float.
That is why before you arrived...
Now you cannot play your little tricks!
You have blundered, hero!
He's starting to look... like a villain...!
Deku!
Uraraka!
How's it going?
Iida found me.
Sorry!
I'm evil!
Right now, he's slowly...
Where are you?
The middle of the fifth floor.
Almost directly above!
We probably don't have much time left, either.
If we run out of time, our opponents win!
I can't...
I can't... lose this fight!
They're loaded.
Kacchan.
Why won't you use your Quirk?
Are you saying you can win even if you don't use it?
Are you underestimating me, Deku?
I have no choice but to do it.
I can do it.
I can!
I'm not scared of you anymore!
With your stalking, you probably already know...
My Quirk, Explosion,
lets me secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat from the sweat glands on the palm of my hand and make it explode.
If they made this the way I asked,
then these gauntlets will store the nitroglycerin inside them, and...
Don't tell me that's...
Young Bakugo, stop!
Are you trying to kill him?!
If I don't hit him, he won't die!
This is supposed to be a class!
Young man!
Young Midoriya!
Is that...
even allowed...?
Wow...
The more that's stored in these gauntlets, the stronger the blast.
Come on, use your Quirk, Deku...
Even if you're at full strength...
Bakugo, answer me!
Did you do that?
What in the world did you do?
This is my chance!
Explain yourself!
If we retrieve the weapon, we'll win!
I won't let you, hero!
We need to touch the weapon itself for it to count as being retrieved.
Can she make herself float now, too?
Release!
It's a special move that's hard on my body!
Your Quirk is not a threat if you cannot touch anything.
I'll hold out until time runs out!
Deku's trying so hard, though!
Hey, hey, what's wrong, Deku?
I didn't hit you, so you can still move, can't you?
Come at me!
The explosion shot out.
He had his costume made so that his Quirk would work even for long distances.
Uraraka, what's the situation?
Deku!
Ignoring me again?
I can't believe him!
Teacher, you should stop them!
That Bakugo's really crazy!
He's gonna kill him!
No...
I won't do so much damage that this fight gets stopped, but I'm gonna get close!
If I don't hit him, he won't die!
Strangely enough, part of him is still sane.
I don't know if it's small-minded or what...
But anyway...
Young Bakugo, the next time you use that, I'll stop the fight, and your team will lose.
Huh?
To attack on such a large scale inside
is inviting the destruction of the stronghold you should be protecting.
That is a foolish plan for both heroes and villains!
You will lose a lot of points for it!
As a teacher...
However...
Go to the pillar by the windows!
Over and out!
Fine, then!
Let's fight it out with our fists!
It's no good, I can't dodge it!
A counterattack...
Watch the timing...
Now!
What was that just now?
He doesn't look like the type to think...
What do you mean?
He changed his course in a blast that doubled as a smoke screen
and then did it again immediately.
Getting in a clean hit while fighting against inertia...
He's too talented... too talented...
Ugh...
Look, here I come!
It's your favorite right swing!
Deku!
You are...
He's not going to give me a chance to think...
I couldn't do it after all...
He's too strong...
I have no choice... but to use it...
This is a lynching!
He can capture him for this exercise by just wrapping the tape around him!
Those are not the actions of a hero.
I thought Midoriya was pretty amazing, too...
But in terms of combat power...
I should stop it...
But...
He's running away?
That's not something a man should do...
But something's strange...
Why...?
Why won't you use your Quirk?
Are you underestimating me?!
No...
You have been like this ever since we were kids!
Have you been underestimating me like that since then, you bastard?!
That's not it...
You're...
You're an amazing person, so that's why...
I want to win...
Don't look at me like that!
You damn nerd!
These are the first passionate emotions he's shown other than I want to be a hero!
I'm sure this is necessary for you... to arrive at the future you're looking at!
Detroit...
I said, this looks bad!
Teacher!
Both of you, sto
Let's go, Uraraka!
Okay!
There's still no way I can beat you one-on-one...
But
What the?
Sorry, Iida!
Improvised special move
Comet Home Run!
You call that a home run?!
Release!
Retrieved!
No...!
The weapon...!
The weapon...! The weapon...! The weapon...! The weapon...!
That's what...
From the start, you were...
You are underestimating me, aren't you?!
I wasn't...
Because I can't use it...
Because my body...
can't handle... the impact...
Mr. Aizawa too...
said... so...
But...
Hero...
Hero team...
You kids still have a lot of room to grow!
This is just the beginning!
Next time, Bakugo's Start Line!
Young Bakugo will get all teary-eyed!
Go beyond!
Plus Ultra!
'Cause I'm better than you!
That's Kacchan for ya!
I'm better than him!
No Trespassing
You can't go in there!
You can't go in there!
