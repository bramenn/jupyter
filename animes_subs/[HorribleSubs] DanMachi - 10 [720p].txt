Okay. See you later, Goddess!
Okay. You know...
Eina-san told me I needed to make sure I had it
before I adventured in the middle floors.
I think it's a little flashy.
Well, if your advisor says that, she's sure to be right.
Anyway, don't overdo it just because you're Level 2 now.
Right!
Okay, bye!
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Pass Parade Procession of Monsters
What's important is coming back safe! Okay?
Right!
Mikoto, you've leveled, but don't tense up.
Okay!
We'll be off, then, Takemikazuchi-sama.
Yeah.
So those are the children of your familia, Take?
Oh, Hestia.
They're going to the middle floors?
Yeah.
Your Little Rookie is heading there, too, right?
Yup. Today's his first time.
He left early this morning.
Well, worrying won't help anything.
All we can do is wait and believe in them.
Yeah.
An earthquake?
There's a lot of them lately.
You're right.
I think it's just a coincidence, but...
You'll be okay, right, Bell-kun?
You're too slow!
Okay!
Well, I think that's pretty good for our first battle in the middle floors.
Yeah.
They're not more than we can handle.
It looks like we'll be able to deal with a hellhound's fire attacks, too.
Yeah.
Anyway, let's head to someplace more open.
If we got surrounded here, it'd be
Bell-sama?
Yeah, that's Bell.
Those are Al-mi'raj!
Bell's attacking us!
Bell-sama's in a hurry.
I said they're Al-mi'raj!
About the Little Rookie...
As we thought, other adventurers are not very fond him.
Some say he only managed to beat the minotaur alone
because he got lucky with his magic,
or that he just defeated the Loki Familia's leftovers.
The Blessing of the Gods doesn't let you level up just like that.
Some people also claim he's lying about how long it took.
That nobody could beat the Sword Princess's record.
Everyone's so hard on him.
But the more I hear, the more interesting he gets.
I can't wait to meet him.
What are you planning, Hermes-sama?
You seem to have taken quite an interest in this.
What? Asfi, are you jealous?
Of course not!
I just don't want us to get caught up in trouble.
Think about what I have to
All of our members are grateful to you.
Their leader makes their job easy, they say.
And you have a god relying on you, too. That's my girl.
I can't take this...
Hermes-sama?
Chloe-chan! Syr-chan!
Mikoto! Hurry!
Don't fall behind!
Right!
Sorry to make you do all the work.
Please don't say that, Ouka-dono.
We're a party.
Oh, no!
Hellhounds are after us, too!
There's a room up ahead!
We'll escape there!
Damn it! We don't even have time to breathe!
Or even time to talk, too!
The middle floor monsters are much stronger and more
numerous than we've ever seen.
Ouka-dono!
The Hellhounds will be here soon!
We need to get back to the upper floors!
We'll run through them, Mikoto.
Ouka-dono! But then...
I value your lives more than those of strangers
who I've never met before.
If you don't like it, you can bitch me out later!
Oh, no! The monsters chasing them will attack us instead!
It's a pass parade!
You're kidding me...
We're retreating. Hurry to the corridor!
Lili, go on ahead.
Bell-sama!
Firebolt!
Oh, no!
Don't mess with me!
Lili, are you okay?
Yeah...
You safe, too, Welf?
Yeah, somehow.
There are more coming.
That's not all.
From both sides...?
Why are monsters so quick to attack on the middle floors?
Because it's the middle floors, I guess.
Cranel-san,
the dungeon is a cunning thing.
Each incident that happens there may be small in and of itself,
but as they add up, they become a death of a thousand cuts.
And...
Tripping you when you can barely stand
is easier than falling off a log.
You can't regroup quickly.
When its prey is gasping for breath,
moaning in pain,
and thoroughly weakened...
That is when the dungeon bares its fangs.
No way...
Monsters?
No...
I won't make it...
So these
are the middle floors...
Really?
Bell-kun's party hasn't come back?
And they haven't been here either, have they?
That's true.
If nothing else, I haven't seen them.
I see.
I want to issue a quest.
The quest is to find Bell-kun's party!
Hestia!
Take?
Are you okay?
Yeah, sorry.
Man, our luck is crap.
We want to go back up as fast as we can,
but we fell down two floors instead.
It's a miracle all three of us survived that fall.
Yeah.
If it weren't for my salamander wool,
that hellhound's breath would've wiped us all out.
We owe your advisor, big time.
You're right.
Another...
Bell, Li'l Lili,
leave me if you must.
Welf, what are you
Either way, with this leg, I'm only going to slow you down.
But I can't do that!
We don't have a choice.
If we...
If we want to survive, we can also try going down to the 18th floor.
L-Lili, wait.
Go even further down?
The enemies will just get stronger!
The 18th floor is one of several safe zones in the dungeon.
That is, monsters don't appear on that floor.
If we can get some higher-level adventurers
to take us back up with them,
our odds of survival increase.
But how...?
We'll use the holes.
There are many holes like this in the middle floors.
We can probably go down a lot more quickly than we can go up.
What about the floor boss?
That thing's on the 17th floor, right?
If you mean the Goliath,
the Loki Familia should have beaten it on their way down.
Given the time it takes to respawn,
if we go now, we'll get through first.
Have you lost your mind?
It's just an option.
I'll leave the decision to Bell-sama, our party leader.
M-Me?
Okay. Decide.
No matter what happens, we won't blame you.
Let's keep going.
I'm sorry, Hestia.
So you're saying they dumped their monsters on Bell's party?
They were desperate, but... I'm sorry.
If Bell-kun doesn't come back...
I'll blame you until the day I die.
But...
I won't hate you. I promise.
So... please. Would you help me?
As you say.
Even if you want to put together a search party,
most of our high-level members are out on the Loki Familia's expedition.
The only ones I can send down to the middle floors are Ouka and Mikoto,
and Chigusa to act as a supporter.
The others, unfortunately, would just slow you down.
But with just three people...
I'll help too, Hestia.
Hermes!
What are you doing here?
When did you get back?
Oh, I heard one of my dear friends was in trouble, so I hurried over.
I'll help, too.
With your quest to find Bell Cranel and his friends.
Dear friend?
You've barely spoken to Hestia since you came down from Heaven.
She's right.
Some dear friend.
Oh, my. You guys are harsh.
But it's true that I want to help Hestia.
I want to save Bell-kun, too.
I'll take Asfi here.
She's our ace. Don't worry.
What will you do, Hestia?
Finding Bell-kun's party is my top priority now.
I want as many people as I can get.
I'm counting on you, Hermes.
Yeah. I'll handle this.
We'll set out once the preparations are made.
Yeah. That'll be tonight.
Ouka, you guys get ready, too.
Right!
Hey, what is it, Asfi?
Hermes-sama, you just said you'd take me, but...
You can't mean...
Yup. I'm going, too!
But it's against the rules for a God to enter the dungeon!
It'll be fine as long as nobody finds out.
It just means I can't do anything stupid.
This was your plan from the start, wasn't it.
I hope you can babysit me.
Take me, too.
Hestia!
Calm down, Hestia!
It's against the rules for a God to enter the dungeon, so...
It'll be fine as long as nobody finds out, right?
I'm going to help save Bell-kun, too.
I can't leave his fate to somebody else.
I'm going, too.
Got it?
You know...
I'm sorry. This is our fault.
Forget about it.
I can feel it.
It's okay.
Bell-kun is alive.
The blessing I gave him hasn't disappeared.
Hestia,
when you find Welf, there's something I want you to give him...
Along with this message from me.
Is that okay?
Yeah, that's fine.
Asfi, do you think you can protect both me and Hestia by yourself?
I don't think I can guarantee it.
I thought so.
I guess I'll take one more along.
Hey, Li'l Lili.
Can you do anything about this smell?
I'm sorry, but I'm closer to it than you are!
So why don't you hold it, then?
You're not the only one who smells it!
I smell it, too!
But I'm carrying it to help everybody even though you keep complaining!
This our final lifeline.
As long as this awful smell is around us,
monsters will usually stay away.
I know, but...
We can't help it, Welf...
Leave it to me!
Burn, dark magics!
Will o' Wisp!
That really is amazing.
A spell that uses the enemy's magic to make them self-destruct!
I never thought I'd use it this way, though.
But are you okay?
You've had to use it a bunch of times already.
Don't worry.
I'm good for a little more.
What are you thinking, I wonder?
Well, it's fine.
But remember...
I'm the only one who's allowed to play with him.
Lili...
Yeah.
The scent-bag's effect ran out.
No way...
What is that?
Gods damn it!
Bell...
What is that?
Wow...
Well, he's the guy who beat a minotaur at Level 1!
Bell-sama!
Are you okay?
Everyone, you're ready, right?
Yup.
Okay, let's go find Bell
Hestia-sama.
You're...
Don't worry. She's here to help.
Then let's go!
And save Bell-kun's party!
