It appeared as though humanity would be destroyed by the demons.
But a single mage saved them all.
He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
Hey, isn't this just messed up?
Why did I have to get kicked out?
I have more magical power than the royals do.
Magic is everything in this world... isn't it?
This is a load of bull!
Who are you talking to?
I'm just talking to myself.
We're ready.
Yeah... I'll show the Clover Kingdom's Magic Knights the true extent of my powers!
I would always close my eyes
And cower at reality
I can't stand the idea
Of just making excuses to give up
Stand right there
I don't want to be near you
Any minute now
Just wait right there
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)
Black and blue
I'll give up on giving up
And get the world on my side
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive
Every time somewhere under this sky
Break through the tearful nights
And head where the light shines
I want to keep my promise
I'll deliver it to you
shape of love
Capital Riot
There's no reason to run from these jerks.
Asta?
Calling us peasants, rats, embarrassments, failures...
Who cares if you think we're worthy or not?!
Just you watch! I'm going to
That's enough, you scoundrel.
You shouldn't even be allowed to talk!
Silence!
I won't shut up!
He just...
Listen up, you bastards!
I'm going to pile up merit,
become the Wizard King,
and shut you all up!

You fool
A-Asta...
Not a chance.
Become...
Don't make us laugh!
Water Binding Magic: Sea Serpent's Coils!
What?
Mist Binding Magic: Mist Spider's Threads.
I knew it...
He's erasing the magic.
He's no ordinary peasant.
But...
If that's his attack range, there's no reason for concern.
Sand Creation Magic: Sand-Armored Guard!
A-Asta!
I-I think that's enough.
Keep your mouth shut.
Y-Yes, sir.
To act in such a way at a festive occasion like the decoration ceremony...
You will surely be punished.
Come on, now...
Why so soft, Golden Dawn?
Anyone that self-confident needs to be taught a lesson.
That's...
So that they can never talk back again.
Solid, please don't!
Holy Water Bullet!
Asta!
You're such an embarrassment.
Apologize...
to Noelle!
Did you just make me kneel?
You lowly peasant!
I'm not holding back anymore!
Solid, p-please, no more...
Nozel?
Solid, don't be so quick to use your magic on a mere peasant.
B-But...
Silence.
Do you plan to shame the Silva family?
What is this chill in the air?
It's a cold pressure that's different from Captain Yami's...
This is the Captain of the Silver Eagles?
A peasant that foolishly tried to defy royalty... How shall I punish you?
Wh-What should I do? At this rate, Asta will...
That's enough.
You're getting so worked up over a little boy.
You should be ashamed of yourself, Silvas.
It's just as Mimosa said.
You're quite amusing!
Huh?
All right, rejoice! I, Leopold Vermillion, declare you my rival!
Huh?
What was your name? Casta?
Leopold, it's Asta. He's Asta.
Asta, eh? That's a great name, my rival!
R-Rival?!
Come, now! Rejoice!
Rejoice.
Y-Yay...
Vermillion...
Leopold and Fuegoleon are my cousins.

Vermillion Family
My father's older brother is Fuegoleon and Leopold's father.
Also, my mother's older sister is Noelle's mother.
Too many royals.
Huh?
Um... Thanks, but my rival's actually Yuno, who's standing over there.
No worries! One can never have too many rivals!
What the heck?
Hey, Asta! You have a very nice body!
You are indeed qualified to be my rival!
All right! Let us arm wrestle.
Why?!
Guys really are dumb, aren't they, Sis?
Mind your manners, Sol.
My bad, Sis!
Call me Captain, Sol.
My bad, Sis!
Sol...
I know, Sis!
Sis!
Come at me!
Is now really the time for this?
Why are you holding back? Come!
What?!
Becoming Leopold's rival... Asta truly is amazing!
My, aren't we all so very noisy today?
Looks like things have calmed down.
A royal acknowledging a peasant as his rival?
Lord Julius allowed the boy to be here.
He may be a peasant, but doesn't he deserve a little credit?
I never thought I'd hear such nonsense from a royal's mouth.
It appears that the Vermillion family has gone soft.
You're a disgrace to us all.
What?
How am I, an eagle that soars the sky,
supposed to give any credit to an insect that crawls on the ground?
Wh-What a tremendous clash of mana!
H-Holy crap...
You can feel it?
Even if I can't feel their mana, I can tell... that this is amazing!
Shouldn't we stop them, Sis?
This is foolish. Ignore the men and their boorish fighting.
Also, call me Captain.
Sure thing, Sis!
Call me
Th-There's an emergency!
What's wrong?
Th-The capital!
The capital is under attack!
Destroy!
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy!
Wh-What's going on?
Destroy all the fools who can't understand my worth!
Such disgusting creatures. Where did they come from?
You must not value your lives, if you're invading the royal capital like this!
Wh-What are these things?
They keep coming toward us even when we shoot their limbs off!
Do not falter!
Protect the Clover Ki
You won't be able to, you scum!
Get lost, scum! Scum! Scum!
What is this magic?
You're stronger than me, right? Right?!
Get out here, Magic Knights!
The Royal Capital is under attack?!
Stone Creation Magic: Stone Model of the World.
It's... a three-dimensional model of the Noble Realm?
W-Wow!
Even the voices of the people at the scene and their magic levels...
Is he lacing the whole area with mana and simultaneously making it visible?
This is much more advanced than my Magic Flower Guidepost!
A force with this much magic appears in five places simultaneously,
without us noticing...
A formidable spatial magic user must have made them materialize in an instant.
Even then, the guard mages of the Noble Realm work in shifts,
constantly keeping a magic barrier in place.
It should be impossible to enter with spatial magic.
Did they analyze the barrier's mechanism and break through it?
Or did one of the guard mages betray us?
Either way, they must be phenomenally skilled.
How should we assign the members we currently have?
First, we need to guard the area around the castle.
Wait, what the heck are we waiting for?!
I get it! There are people out there who need our help!
I'm gonna go!
Asta!
Where do you plan to go?
We don't even know the full situation yet, and you can't sense magic at all!
I'm going to where it's noisiest!
Wha D-Do you think you're an animal or something?!
Interesting!
Let's see what you've got!
Wait for me, Asta, my rival!
Guys really are dumb, aren't they, Sis?
Yes, they are.
And call me Captain.
Leo's still very much a child.
I'll have to thoroughly retrain him later.
I'm sure you'd rather not take orders from me, but listen well, Magic Knights!
I'll go after Leo and that Black Bulls boy,
and after I've joined them, we'll head to the north district.
You, Black Bulls girl, come with me.
Silver Eagles, I ask that you head to the central district,
where the magic is strongest.
Very well.
Blue Roses, head to the east district!
I'd rather not take orders from a man, but I suppose I don't have a choice.
Here we go, Sis!
Call me Captain.
Golden Dawn, split into two teams and head to the west and northwest districts!
We will protect the people of the Nobel Realm.
Let us go.
I guess we'll just have to save dessert for later.
If we fail to protect the royal capital, we'll bring shame upon the Magic Knights!
Do not let the enemy escape, no matter what!
Right!
Munchy, munchy...
I managed to get in by following Asta and the others,
but it looks like something awful is happening.
This looks like a job for Charmy!
If I do good, I might get the chance to eat even better food!
I smell something delicious!
I have to fuel up before the battle!
Central District
Don't think you're going to get away with...
What? What do you want?
I'll give it to you, just
East District
Mind your manners, Sol.
My bad, Sis!
Call me Captain.
Northwest District
Those who dare to bring chaos upon the kingdom shall perish before my magic!
These things keep getting up with half-assed attacks.
In that case...
West District
I guess we should work off some calories before dessert.
Fools who disturb the peace of the capital... You shall be eliminated!
North District
Wh-What is this?
I've never seen them before. What country is that army from?
Where's Asta?
Little girl... Do you like the Clover Kingdom?
I-I love it!
So please... stop this.
Well, I hate it!
So the town... the people...
And you, too, little girl...
I'll destroy you all!
Then I'll protect them!
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
And push me forward
(I can't find a place to go)
Even the faintest light can still break through the darkness
And change the flow of time
(I will keep believing in you)
In this ever-vivid place
(Break free yourself)
In order to grasp my endless dream
If there is a path that I should choose
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)
Wherever it may lead us
Until my life comes to an end
I will accept any pain that comes my way
(We can try again, we can try again)
Even if we can't see tomorrow
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice
I'll keep screaming them in my heart
Petit Clover!
Mr. Animal
Mr. Animal.
I'm going to where it's noisiest!
Wha D-Do you think you're an animal or something?!
An animal?
Woof, woof.
A dog... My, how adorable.
But a cat might be nice, too.
Meow, meow.
How delightful!
Oh, but maybe something even wilder, like a wolf...
All men are wolves.
Oh, I just can't choose!
Not a chance...
What a creepy enemy! But there's no time to be creeped out.
I will protect the citizens of the Clover Kingdom!
