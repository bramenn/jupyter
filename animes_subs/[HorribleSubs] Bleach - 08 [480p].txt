Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
I shall go
Boy, this hill is really steep.
Is it? It doesn't bother me.
But if you say things like that
Hang in there, Yuzu! Don't give up!
Dad is on your side!
See?
Ignore him, Yuzu!
If you pay attention to guys like him, it will only encourage him.
How naIve. Even if you ignore me, I'm automatically encouraged!
Run!
My deathblow: Father's Slide!
Begoneto the ends of the earth!
Now's our chance. Let's go.
Boy, it's only June, but it sure is hot today.
It was June 17 that day too, but what a difference.
Oh, someone else is here.
You're right. I wonder if she's here to visit a grave too.
Huh? But
she's waving.
Ichigo, do you know her?
No! I don't know her!
Not at all! If I say I don't know her, I don't!
There's something familiar about her
I remember now!
She's a classmate from middle school!
It's all coming back to me! Oh, boy! I feel so nostalgic.
I think I want to talk to her all alone, right now!
And so, I'll go and have a talk with her.
You two go ahead and visit Mom's grave!
Ichigo!
What? Karin, what do you mean by that?
Well, I think the time for you to let go of your brother is close at hand.
Huh? What do you mean? Karin, wait a minute!
Why the heck did you follow me here?
Idiot! What if a Hollow appears when I'm not around?
That's no reason to
I mean If you're gonna follow me, be more discreet!
Well, pardon me I didn't think of it.
What are you mad about?
I'm not really mad
Killed...
That's what you said about your mother, right?
I didn't say that.
Who killed her?
I never said that. Forget it.
You said you've been able to see spirits
ever since you can remember, didn't you?
Then, answer one question.
The one who killed your mother
Wasn't it a Hollow?
There is that possibility.
If your spiritual capabilities were such
that you were able to see souls since you were so little,
the Hollow that came after you
may have killed your mother by mistake!
I can't take this anymore!
You've got to be kidding.
As far as you're concerned, Hollows are responsible for everything.
There was never anything funny about it,
but when you give that as a reason for it
there isn't anything that's less funny!
Sorry to disappoint you, but you're way off base.
It wasn't a Hollow or anything.
The one who killed my mom
was me.
Hey, Ichigo!
Huh? When Ichigo was little?
Why do you ask, out of the blue?
Did something happen?
Yes, well actually
I might have found out about his secret.
His secret?
Yeah. Ichigo might really be a hero protecting the earth!
A h-hero, is he?
I think I was around four when I first met that hero.
He came to my dojo with hair an unbelievable color,
holding the hand of an unbelievably beautiful mother,
and with this unbelievably goofy grin on his face.
He was skinny and wimpy and looked so weak.
He really was a weakling
Speaking of which,
I was the first one to make him cry.
I just poked him once, as a joke.
It didn't even take ten seconds.
But even if he had been crying,
as soon as he saw his mother who came to pick him up
he'd immediately break out into a smile.
I hated that about him.
A boy shouldn't be so happy when he's lost.
That's what I thought, looking at his smiling face.
He was such a wimpy mama's boy
but he seemed really happy like he was having a great time.
And thenwhen we were nine
his mother passed away.
Yeah We were still nine.
He was still a wimp, always clinging to his mother
but she died
He didn't come to school from that day
I wondered what he was doing, so I went looking for him and
I found him on the riverbank where his mother had died.
He was there with his book bag on his back.
When he got tired, he'd crouch down, but then he'd stand up again.
Day after day, he seemed to be searching for his mother, all day long.
I couldn't bear to see him like that Ichigo, back then.
Tatsuki
I killed my mom?
The one who killed your mother Wasn't it a Hollow?
What an idiot I am
Hey, Rukia!
What is it, Kon?
Didn't I tell you not to come out until I called you?
But, Rukia, it's pretty hot in here.
I can't take it.
Can't we go home yet?
Didn't I tell you?
We've got to stay near him,
or we'll be too late if a Hollow makes an appearance.
That's all you think about, Hollow, Hollow, Hollow!
Listen, if your job is all you think about,
you're going to lose all your friends!
Oh Awk!
I-I'm sorry. Are you mad?
What is it?
HmI sure slept well Huh?
Good morning!
You!
I get nothing but these trying missions, you see.
I can't keep them up unless I get plenty of sleep.
S-Soul Reaper?
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Missionyou said?
See ya!
Yeah. See you tomorrow!
Oh!
Oh my What a mean truck driver.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry. Let's switch places. I'll walk on the road side.
It's okay.
I'm wearing a raincoat, so I'm all right.
I'll protect you from stuff like what just happened.
My, how reliable
But no
I can't let you take the road-side so long as you can't beat Tatsuki!
I won a point from her last time.
There, you're all cleaned up.
Hm...
Let's go!
Huh?
Mom, can I hold your hand?
Of course.
I would always feel at ease
whenever my mother was nearby.
Huh? What's that girl doing?
Back then, I still couldn't tell the difference
between humans who were living and those who were dead.
Wait a minute, Mom! Ichigo
No, Ichigo!
When I was really little,
my dad told me they gave me the name Ichigo
which contains the meaning to completely protect one thing you set your mind on.
When I heard that, I decided to protect my mother.
I decided that, but
I don't know what caused it
but it was clear that it happened as she tried to save me.
I just loved my mom.
Not only meso did Yuzu and Karin, who were only four.
And Dad loved Mom, too.
Our whole family revolved around her.
And she was snatched away
from that center
by me.
Kurosaki Family Tomb  It's been a while, Mom  Have you been well?
Well, if you're dead, there's no being well or not, I guess.
We're all doing great me, Yuzu, and Ichigo, too.
Quit crying, already, Yuzu. You do this every year.
We're 11 already this year, we're grownups.
I know I know that, but
You don't know anything
Now, now, now!
Cheer up!
It's time now for our annual Kurosaki Family Headstone Dominoes Tournament!
A full two-and-a-half hours of tombstone toppling
Why don't you go and start your life over from scratch?!
There'll be some wardrobe malfunctions, too
To be honest, that shaggy guy has so much energy it's annoying.
There'll even be some peeks!
Go away!
Wait!
Just who are you?
Answer the question.
It's been a while
The name Rukia Kuchiki was famous back at the Soul Reaper Academy.
Adopted into the noble Kuchiki family
you were known as the'Princess from the Rukon District.'
Oh, and I'm Eikichiro Saidoh.
I was two years ahead of you. You remember me, don't you?
Come on! I was pretty popular too.
People used to call me that funny guy.
See?!
I don't remember you.
R-Really?
Oh, well.
Anyway
I have a few questions for you.
You can't hide it forever
Are you from Stealth Force?
Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ta-dah You are correct!
Quit fooling around! What is it you want?!
Ichigo! Where are you?!
Rukia is Huh?!
Rukia is!
Here we go
You!
Ichigo!
They're getting pretty irritated over there
They wonder why you haven't come back.
Hollows appear. Orders come in too.
That's why I haven't gone back. That's all there is to it.
Then why are you dressed like that?
Dressed? What does it matter, how I dress?!
Oh, well, I guess you're finally coming of age.
What are you talking about?
Don't hide it. Don't hide it.
It's him, isn't it?
The guy who's mother is said to have been killed by a Hollow.
The guy with the spiked hair!
What are you...?
Is it pity?
Or, are you looking for pleasure in the human world?
It's none of your business!
Shall I sew that mouth of yours shut?!
Don't be so embarrassed.
It's best to be straightforward.
Butdoing it with a human boy
Guess you can't say it!
No good, huh?
Too bad. I thought that would be a good excuse.
If I don't get an answer the superiors will be happy with,
I'll have to take you back, even if I have to drag you.
Is that a threat?
Well
I have no intention of returning for a while.
Now you've done it I have no choice.
Rukia!
Rukia!
Hey! Who are you?!
Yo, Spiky! You can see me?
Kon, who is this guy?
How should I know?
What?! You're the one who said it was an emergency!
Hey, Spiky
What about you? Who are you?
I'm
Ichigo! Don't!
I'm a Surrogate Soul Reaper!
Soul Reaper?
No way What a stupid joke.
That's too funny.
Really, Rukia Kuchiki This is a serious crime.
A serious crime?
What's he talking about?
Oh, well. It's no fun fighting a dumb Gigai, but anyway
Let's do this, Spiky!
W-What?!
D-Damn it!
Huh?! Ughh
It's the end!
Huh?!
Ugh
Stupid Ichigo
Interesting. You transformed, and you're a human.
How did you get that ability?
As if I'd tell you after attacking me out of the blue!
Ichigo! Back away! This is my...
You don't have your sword. What can you do?
Out of the way, Kon!
What's wrong?
Karin?
There you are!
What's the matter?
Where's Dad?
He said he was going to have a talk with the priest.
That good-for-nothing!
I'm going to have you keep me company for a while.
The bigger the bait, the better
Karin?
Heh-heh-heh!
Yuzu! Run!
He's strong
What's with you, anyway?
Is brute strength all you've got?
You have no idea how to fight.
Shut up!
What is it?!
It's a Hollow!
A Hollow?!
Where is it?!
Closeand Look at this!
This spiritual energy It's quite a big one!
Hmm Seems pretty strong
Aargh! What? You want to fight again?!
Ichigo, now's not the time!
Your family might be in danger again!
Let's go!
H-Hey!
Oh, no!
Karin!
No! Don't come near!
Karin! Karin! What's going on?!
Yuzu!
What's happening?
Yuzu
What did he mean by serious crime?
Don't worry about my problems now!
We've got to save your family first!
Aren't you going to ask me anything about my mother?
If I do, will you answer me?
It's your problem
a deepdeep problem.
I have no way of asking you about it.
No good way of asking you without tracking mud into your heart.
That's why I'll wait.
When you're ready to talk, tell me about it
I'll wait until then.
Oh dear, this is a problem.
What should I do?
Yuzu
You're so noisy. One hostage is good enough.
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
I decidedto protect
