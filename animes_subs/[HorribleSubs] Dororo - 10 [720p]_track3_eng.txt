Please, no!
Please don't eat me!
Party is over
But I still wanna dance
I can't even sleep
Someday, one day my passion's fire will
From the beginning I knew
One day the flames would die out
Hey, I thought I didn't need anything
But even now, I'm so serious
Ah... I still have time to make it
Ah... but I'm gonna burn it up, baby
Sorry darling, it's not that easy
But surely it's not that bad either
Give me fire
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah
Party is over
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it
Give me fire
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah
10 The story of Tahomaru
There hasn't been any rain for 2 months now.
If this drought continues, it will affect the harvest.
The neighboring Asakura clan is getting restless.
We've gotten news that they've been quietly gathering an army at the border.
We should take action before they start a war.
That grave face...
It must be related to the secret Father is keeping from me.
Mutsu, Hyogo.
I need you to do something.
Don't let anyone from my family know.
HALL OF HELL
It must be that baby.
He's still alive and is trying to take his body back from you.
Answer me!
Just as I thought...
You done?
You okay?
Oh, jeez.
Anyways, that merchant says that the land is really rich there.
The people eat all the white rice they want even in these times.
Amazing, huh?
Let's go there next. We'll make loads of money and stuff ourselves silly.
Whole sea breams, dried abalones, manju steamed buns...
Manju?
They're soft, sweet, and so delicious.
You'll love them, just you wait.
I'd been wanting to ask you.
It's a family seal on that amulet, right? Is it your family's?
I've drugged him.
He'll answer anything you ask him.
My father has given you special orders, hasn't he?
What were those orders?
To find a baby that disappeared 16 years ago...
and the midwife.
Why is my father looking for a baby?
Because...
Answer me.
He tried to bite his tongue off.
Will he die?
No, the cut is not deep.
The drug must've weakened him.
Father, what is on your mind?
The Asakura clan is getting restless.
Is that all?
Father, why are you searching for a baby?
A baby from over a decade ago.
That headless Goddess of Mercy that Mother worships,
does it have anything to do with it?
Please answer me, Father!
It is none of your concern.
-Yet... -End of story.
How can you still be alive?
I'm surprised you found me here.
You always came here as a child whenever anything happened.
And we came for you each time.
Every time.
Young Master.
Let's go home.
When I was a child, huh.
I must still seem like a child to my father.
That's why he won't take me to war and keeps secrets.
I've never seen my father looking like that.
The matter with the baby must mean that much to him.
What's going on?
Please, have mercy on us.
Don't just leave us here to die!
Let go of me! Let go, or I'll...
What's going on?
Sir Tahomaru.
We were passing through this village on our way back.
They suddenly stopped us.
Please, save us!
The whole village is going to be eaten up by the monster.
Monster, you say?
A whirling current?
Ripples in the water suddenly turn into a whirling current.
The current pulls you in, and there's a huge mouth waiting here.
And it eats up our people, boat and all.
Many of our villagers have fallen victim to it.
A whirling current with a mouth...
It does sound like the supernatural.
Fine, I will defeat it for you.
Sir Tahomaru.
You don't believe these people, do you?
Even if it were true, you shouldn't be fighting monsters...
These people are not lying.
My people are suffering. You tell me to leave them?
No, that is not what I meant...
If the monster scares you, go ahead and leave.
Sir Tahomaru!
You don't have to come, either.
You must be joking, sir.
We would follow you even into the depths of hell.
What is it?
The oar seems to be stuck...
It's coming.
There it is! The monster!
It's going to eat us...
Stay calm, pull the ropes!
What's wrong? You can't eat us just by waiting there.
It's a crab! A monster crab!
What a hideous sight.
I will slay you.
Young Master!
It got away.
It's attacking from below.
Sir Tahomaru!
Pull the ropes, get back on land!
It's been hurt badly, too.
It can't come chasing us.
If it had stabbed a few more times, the boat would've sunk.
It is disadvantageous for us to fight on the lake.
What should we do?
Young Master, a word.
The monster eats with its mouth.
We should carry explosives in our clothes and make them explode as he swallows us.
It has a hard shell, but a soft inside.
The monster will definitely be killed.
So the one who is swallowed will die with the monster, huh.
We will do it.
I just said it'd kill you.
It will not.
We brothers only exist to protect you.
If we died, we couldn't do that.
So we will not die.
Young Master.
Look at this land.
The mountains are green, and the streams are flowing.
The paddies are full of rice.
This is Daigo's land.
But I heard it wasn't like this before I was born.
Floods kept the rice from growing.
People chewed on tree roots to keep from starving.
And who made this land so rich?
My father, Daigo Kagemitsu.
I am his son, Tahomaru.
I will defeat any measly monster with my own hands.
What I need you to do is not to die.
Just trust me. That's all I ask.
Young Master.
Yes, sir!
Hyogo, lift me up.
Hurry.
Higher, even higher.
That's it.
Mutsu, gather everyone up.
This is our only way to defeat it.
It won't be easy.
I'll need your help.
We've been waiting for you.
Open the sluice!
There are many small lakes along the main lake.
We connected one with a sluice, with another sluice for draining.
And there you have it.
I see you now. I will slay you this time!
You all stand back.
Come, Mutsu, Hyogo.
-They're subduing that monster... -Wow...
Sir Tahomaru, make it pay for what it's done!
Sir Tahomaru!
Hurray for Sir Tahomaru!
Take this, you monster!
Go back to hell!
This is it for you.
Let me end your misery.
Guard the sluice!
Hyogo!
I'm coming.
-Young Master. -Sir.
Who are you...?
Sorrow scatters in the wind,
piling up to form shadows
Our footsteps admonish indifference in such verbose ways
As I peek into your fathomless eyes, I lose my composure
Is there any hope in the place I am heading to?
I feign amusement and laugh
because this road is so dark
I will be there to shine the light
I'm used to playing at saying goodbye,
but I cried when I waved to you
Our fiery woes fade... and fade... until night falls upon us
If I knew tomorrow would be so mundane,
I wouldn't have said that I wanted to live
I know it's futile but can't help dreaming of a future... a future... you are to blame
