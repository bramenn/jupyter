So here's where you were.
What are you reading?
It's Key of the Starry Heavens.
The guild borrowed the book from the cathedral library to support the others, right?
Huh?
Does the book end like this?
Uh-huh.
Is something wrong?
Master...
What's wrong? You're rather quiet...
It's nothing.
I bet you're worried about Romeo!
Somethin' wrong with that?! I'm his father!
He's with Natsu, right? You got nothin' to worry about!
That's why I'm worried...
What'll I do if Romeo becomes a delinquent?
Look at that, Romeo!
The guy talks like a big shot while he stands on top of an octopus!
But he fought Gildarts to a standstill...
So what?! He's ridin' an octopus! An octopus!
Natsu is setting a bad example...
I'm worried about Romeo-kun's future!
So if I beat him, it's like me beatin' Gildarts, right?!
I'm going to eliminate you.
Where the Crusade Will Lead!
That's some dangerous ink!
Be careful, Natsu!
And it looks so yummy...
Put your appetite off'til later.
Back off, everyone!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
Um... Um...
What should I do? I don't know what to do!
Coco!
Watch out!
Ow... Are you okay?
Um... 7.0...
Where's Dan-san?!
Over there.
Hey, octopus! The least you can do is tell the difference between your enemies and allies!
That's right! Coco and Dan are on your side, aren't they?!
They're proud Legionnaires.
They're prepared to lay down their lives for the sake of this crusade.
What are you talking about, crusade?!
And what kind of guy talks about other people's lives like they're nothing?!
This girl's life doesn't belong to Zentopia or you!
What do you know of what is just?
This crusade
is costing more lives than you people can imagine.
The resonance, huh? Then I'd better get that home soon.
You're not getting it! That's a Man!
Then should we have brother and sisters hurt each other?
You're making a mistake.
For the plural form of brothers and sisters together,
brothers sisters brother/sister brother/sister big brother/little brother/big sister/little sister
it's proper to say keiteishimai.
Yeah?! That's neither here nor there!
Anyway, I'm taking this part with me.
Why are you doing this?!
Why? How would I know?!
But if I do what His Grace says, everything will work out fine.
If you're just doing what you're told...
Is that right?
Then I'll make puppets out of you!
Nee-chan, what's wrong?!
Mira-nee!
Conducting Magic, Second Movement!
This is a forbidden move, but I'll show it to you just this once!
Coming out of Mira-nee's body...
Satan Soul?!
Nee-chan!
Mira-nee!
Do away with these adorable siblings!
No...
Beast Soul!
Awesome!
Oh, no... What should I do?!
This is friggin' awesome.
Everybody who opposes His Grace are bad guys...
And I'm gonna punish the bad guys!
That was some fight between Lily and Sammy, huh?
It was the first fight I saw between two Exceeds.
Since they're the same race and all, they ought to become friends, you know?
That one is incredibly conceited, though...
By the way...
Why is that Sammy cat following us?
Pushy cat...
I'm not following you. I'm just observing.
I'll tell you right now, we're not giving you this clock face!
According to my calculations, it's better that I didn't collect it anyway.
What's that mean?
I can't give you specifics, but...
Nii-san. Can I have a moment?
Look at this! There's a table that practically begs us to sit a spell.
How nice! Shall we have lunch here?
That's fine...
And why was there a size that fit me?!
Well prepared means no worries!
What kind of preparation is this?!
Part of it is to help you get over your trauma, Carla!
Can she get over it this way?
Whether they like it or not, they're all into it...
Besides, to try again to have the first picnic of my life...
Is that right?
We have to go this far for a first picnic...?
But at that last picnic attempt, about this time...
Come on! Let's get started!
Stop right where you are!
Who gave you permission to have a picnic here?!
Wanna suck some mayonnaise?
Lackey A! Lackey B!
Tell'em who owns this plane!
Gotcha, Boss!
The owners of this grassy plane...
Diet? Low-calorie? Get outta here!
Our slogan is, Are you gonna eat that?
That's right! We're...
J-Jiggle Jugs?
There are rules in this plane!
No girls with a good figure can picnic here!
Wanna suck some mayonnaise?
I figured something like this would happen...
And I put my spare flower in my hair...
So we're gonna confiscate all your vittles!
Where's the meat?! I want meat!
Suck some mayonnaise?
You're gonna regret this...
My first time...
This was my second try at the first picnic of my life!
Want some mayonnaise?
I'll make you pay for this.
Requip! Magic Sword, Scarlet Sakura!
It's time for you bastards to learn
what things past cannot be recalled means, from top to toe!
Wanna suck some mayonnaise?!
I knew it would end like this...
Elfman... Lisanna...
Let go of me!
Lisanna!
Well, I'm getting tired of playing...
You're so close, I'll finish the three of you off at the same time.
Stop it. What's so fun about doing this?
I'm not a powerless lamb anymore, am I?
Now, as someone with power,
my job is to eliminate those who would oppose His Grace.
Do you know what a crime it is to make an enemy out of Zentopia?!
You're about to find out!
Oh, no, you don't!
It's useless!
This Holy Tact can control your magic!
Die pitifully,
Fairy Tail wizards!
That power is awesome!
Maybe I overdid it a little...
What is this?!
Nee-chan! No! Don't do it!
Wha...?! I don't believe it! Another Satan Soul?!
I didn't know you could do that!
Elf-niichan... What's that?
Oh, crap... Get back, Lisanna!
That's not Satan Soul...
You've never seen it before. Master forbade her to use it!
The name is...
This octopus tentacle is heavy!
Wait a second, octopus!
This will neutralize the poison in that ink!
Nice timing!
Where'd you call me from?! A stinkin' puddle?!
Sorry, that's all the water there is...
Thank you, Lucy... and... Aquas?
Aquarius!
You caught a Natsu!
This time I'll let you off the hook for summoning me from there,
but work on summoning two Spirits at the same time, get it?!
That way, Scorpio and I can be together here...
I'll do my best!
That Spirit is setting a bad example...
Romeo! Can you get that octopus to open its mouth?!
Leave it to me, Natsu-nii!
Purple Net!
Roar of the...
The idea is to shoot flames right into the octopus's mouth!
That's kind of nasty...
Grilled octopus is delicious!
This one's nasty, too.
You underestimated him.
Kanaloa is a veteran soldier, too.
A simple strategy just won't work.
Oh, no...
This isn't good...
He's got motion sickness already?!
It seems the battle is done.
Well, Kanaloa... Collect the part.
No, you don't!
My father entrusted the hand of that clock to me!
So it's mine! First off, give it back to me!
Why are you people trying to steal the clock parts in the first place?
Steal? You make us sound like common thieves.
Safekeeping.
What does that mean?!
That clock is called the Infinity Clock.
Our orders from the Archbishop of Zentopia
are to collect its parts.
Infinity Clock?
Why would the Archbishop of Zentopia want that?
Time is etched, and then chaos descends...
Do you know what that means?
The sentence you keep hearing in your dreams...
But I don't know what it means...
Once every 100 years,
the magic that the Infinity Clock has accumulated is released and comes into action...
During that time, if the six scattered parts are brought together...
What will happen?
Time will be etched...
What?!
According to the cardinal,
a certain magic guild is searching for the Infinity Clock
and we're the only ones who can stop them. In other words...
Byro...
This is a crusade.
If all the pieces of the clock are brought together...
Chaos will descend...
Is that what it means?
The stakes have suddenly risen...
Do you understand?
A magic guild cannot safeguard items like these.
Certainly, if even one mistake is made in safekeeping them...
But...
There's somethin' fishy about that story!
What?
After all, if you collect all the parts, hell will break loose, right?
Then you shouldn't collect them...
Or are you saying Zentopia should have the destiny of the world in its hands?
That's right! You don't know how to manage them, do you?!
If Zentopia makes a mistake...
There are no mistakes in our doctrine.
And His Grace never makes mistakes.
That's not true.
Everybody makes mistakes.
That's why there will always be wars.
Everyone knows that.
You guys are trying to whitewash it, but you're really up to somethin', aren't you?
Bet anything I'm right!
And if it's not you, then it's that archbishop who's pullin' your strings!
Let me give him a good clobberin'!
What is this blasphemy...?!
Kanaloa...
Natsu-nii!
This spoils the coolness of his words...
What's wrong, Kinana?!
Are you okay?!
It's near...
It's near!
The end... In our hands...
I can hear it! I can hear...
Don't worry. She always has fits like this.
Wakaba, where's our former Master?
In the eastern forest, for therapy...
This isn't good...
Why, at a time like this...?
Run, Lisanna!
How can I? You're carrying me!
This is a breach of the rules!
Now that's a demon!
How sinful! How sinister!
I like the teachings of Zentopia.
Recognize your own sins, don't hide them away.
To make up for them, devote yourself to other people.
But you see...
Why, you... Say what you want!
Your Grace!
Mary is going to break the taboo!
Please forgive me!
Now what?!
Look at that!
I can absorb the people that I control... Conducting Magic, Third Movement!
That's right, I take control directly! This is the taboo!
Is this...
They're moving so fast, my eyes can't keep up!
Mira-nee... is kind of...
Turn to ashes!
No... It has no effect on her?!
You've committed a bigger sin than that.
That is...
You also hurt my little brother and sister...
Just for that, no matter what happens, you're answering to me!
Get away...
She's almost there... Just thinking about it could set her over the edge!
What's going to happen?
S-Stop...
Bad girl!
Bad girl!
Now that's scary...
Nee-chan demolished an entire city in that form like it was nothing!
No wonder she's not supposed to use it...
You understand why we're on a crusade,
yet you still defy us?
To be honest, I don't really understand what this end of the world stuff is about...
But I wanna protect the memento my father left me!
So as for that clock hand and the rest of the parts...
You speak sinfully...
Michelle! Run!
Okay!
Gate of the Bull, I open thee!
Taurus!
Mooost powerful!
One mooore time!
I know you're squished by the tentacle, but it looks great from where I stand, Lucy-san!
Keep the bovine hormones in check and help me!
Indecent...
I'm back!
Natsu!
Alright! Payback, 100 times' worth!
Okay! Yeah! Aye, sir!
Fleuve d'Etoile!
What?!
And then...
Now!
Let's go!
Max speed!
Plus...
Sword Edge...
Can't... hold on...
A fool's breath cancels out Kanaloa's elasticity
and he focuses on just one point...
This is a guild... This is a Fairy Tail wizard?!
All-righty...
Now you're gonna give back what you took from Lucy.
The time is near.
I believe the scattered parts are all converging towards this location.
But I have to finish things up before they arrive.
Then bring it on!
What? Tell me what?
While I am a Legionnaire,
Nii-san and the others are right. I'm also an Exceed.
Our sense of time is different than humans'.
Even a musclehead like you knows that, right, Nii-san?
You tryin' to start a fight?!
Just listen.
Because of the Exceed's unique sense of time,
there's something that leaped out at me after reading that book.
Just in case, I want you to know what it is.
That book... You mean Key of the Starry Heavens?
Asuka hates this book!
The story is weird!
What are you doing, Your Grace?!
It's close... It's so close...
Time is etched, and then chaos descends...
The end is beginning...
The end...
There's something else hidden in that book?!
As a Legionnaire, I shall perform my duty.
But it's the same with Edolas...
No one knows where this crusade will lead
in the human world, Nii-san.
Hey! Isn't nullifying magic against the rules?
Pfft! I can beat that guy even without magic!
Even though you were on the receiving end for some time...
In fact, you couldn't move a muscle...
I-Idiot! Heroes spring into action right after they're in a pinch.
A hero, huh?
Next time: The Time Has Begun!
I think you're closer to an anti-hero...
Come on, any way you slice it, I'm a prototypical hero!
A prototypical hero isn't rough around the edges like you!
