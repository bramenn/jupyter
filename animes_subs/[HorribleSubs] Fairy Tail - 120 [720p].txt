We've got our friends close by!
Now, there's nothing to fear!
Because we're not alone!
Send everything to the pits of darkness!
Fairy Tail, your sun has set!
Dawn on Tenroujima!
Natsu!
I'm gonna fall!
Lucy-san, watch out!
I-Impossible! The Hidden Magic didn't work?!
Unfathomable! My magic is...
They couldn't have...?!
My heart!
What? The earth devils are...
They're disappearing!
The secret to Master Hades's incredible magic power and longevity...
It is a heart contained within the ship... The Devil's Heart...
If that's destroyed... My magic power...
W-What's this?
Huh?
What's the matter, Wendy?
That's...
Tenroujima...
It's returning to normal!
I've been given a new lease on life.
Huh? This is...
Our marks are shining!
Our magic power is returning...
It's back!
We win!
Listen up!
For those who have walked the path of magic,
the devil will never sleep!
Laxus!
Do it!
Fairy Tail!
This might be the final attack!
Let's blast him with all the magic power we got back!
You'll face my wrath for all of this!
We don't have a contract yet, but...
Gate of the Goat, I open thee!
Capricorn!
As you wish, Lucy-sama.
Please!
Of course.
You're...
I am not Zoldy!
I am Lucy-sama's Spirit,
Capricorn!
I learned this from watching!
Wing Slash of the Sky Dragon!
Ice Magic Sword...
Icebringer!
Requip!
Heaven's Wheel...
Pentagram Sword!
Grimoire Law!
New Secret Dragon Slayer Art!
I'm not going to make it!
Crimson Exploding Lightning Edge!
Gramps... We showed'em.
We showed'em the power of the guild putting everything on the line.
This is our Guild!!!
It's over...
Yeah.
We won, didn't we?
Here, your scarf.
Thanks.
Everyone!
Save me, Natsu!
You guys...
Are those...?
This isn't good.
Curses... We really have zero magic power left.
Sorry, but I am also out of magic power.
They're all angry!
Well, I don't really blame them.
That's far enough!
Gramps!
Everyone!
Master! And Gajeel-san, too!
I'm glad you're all safe!
Yes.
With the island returned to normal, so is its divine protection...
There's more of them!
Isn't that Makarov?
And look over there!
Master Hades...
He's been defeated!
Get off this island this instant!
Y-Yes sir, right away!
There's the signal!
Pardon all the fuss!
Oh?
What's the matter, Gray?
Um... Where's Juvia?
She never returned to the camp.
Is she safe? What happened to Zeref?
You did good, coming back.
You think you can set foot on Tenroujima while you're still expelled?!
Pipe down, old man...
Master, please calm down.
His face is huge!
Now, now...
L-Laxus...!
Laxus, you're back?!
Get off me.
Master sure is harsh...
'Cause he's a Man.
Yes.
While he's still expelled, is it?
Okay! Time to continue the exam!
You're gonna do it now?
The second test was interrupted so it don't count!
So let's just do things nice and simple with a big battle!
What's wrong with your head?!
You think you can beat me when you're that busted up?
Stop it, Gajeel!
Yeah, it'll be a cinch!
'Cause right now I'm a Thunder-Fla...
H-Hey...
Natsu?
What kind of passing out is that?
Looks like a side effect from eating something other than flames.
Anyway, shall we return to the camp?
We have to rest a bit or our bodies won't hold up.
You got a point there.
Let's head back!
Hey, what? I'm going to carry Natsu?
Don't worry! I'll be here to cheer you on!
So you'll cheer, but you won't help?
If that is how it shall be,
leave this to meh, Lucy-sama.
Capricorn...
T-Thank you!
Maybe it's my imagination, but is Natsu an afterthought?
And you here, Mr. Cat... Are you a schoolmate of Lucy-sama?
Aye! I am her elder role model!
That is good to hear.
What's with them?
Looks like they're getting along just fine.
I wonder if my father is safe?
Juvia...
Makarov...
Finish me off.
I learned something very important from you.
In return, I will overlook what you did this time.
Leave this island.
Such weakness...
If you let me live, the next time I will surely crush your guild.
I lost to you.
But my children beat you.
Not true. My heart was destroyed, and Tenroujima gave the youngsters power.
Without those coincidences, I would not have lost to your brats.
Why did you fall to darkness?
I told you, once.
The true nature of magic is darkness.
Miracles that are born in the darkness have come to be called magic.
After I retired, I wished to find the truth of this world by walking deep down the path of magic.
This world, overflowing with too much magic, is a false world.
The World of Great Magic is the true magic world!
I wanted to see that world.
And for that goal, I obtained all the keys I needed to resurrect Zeref.
Just a little more! I was so close!
So close to reaching the One Magic!
Even if you find it, nothing will change.
If magic's true nature is darkness, so be it.
And if it's light, that's fine, too.
Magic is alive!
Its role changes with the times.
It grows, along with us.
Every person has their own version of what magic is...
Each person thinks of it differently...
It can become light, or darkness... Or red, or even blue...
Fairy Tail lives together with freedom!
I learned that all from you.
Shut up, will you, Natsu?
Can't you sleep quietly?
Why can't we just let him sleep?
Mira-nee, I just thought of something good!
It's Twin-tail Natsu! Isn't he cute?
Disgusting...
So that thing we destroyed was Hades's heart?
Maybe it was a lucky break, but we did good work.
If we consider that as the power source of the ship,
then the Exceed Squad accomplished our mission.
Yes.
Aye, sir!
Hey... Are you unharmed, Lily?!
Yes. In far better shape than you.
I'm glad you're back, Laxus!
Came back, came back!
Yeah, I ain't really back.
Laxus is back!
I'm tryin' to tell ya...
Elfman did such terrible things to me while you were gone, Laxus!
Would you punish him for me?
You bastard!
Oh? When did you two...?
Hold it a sec! It's kind of hard to explain!
What's that supposed to mean?
Now then, Lucy-sama... If you'll excuse meh...
Thanks a bunch, Capricorn.
I'll be counting on you!
And I, you.
I will endeavor to be of service to you, Lucy-sama.
Which reminds me...
No, nevermind.
What? Don't hold back, tell me!
Well...
I believe it would be best for you to reduce your weight a little,
both for health and magic power reasons.
When I was carrying you earlier, you seemed a little...
Perhaps I could begin to regulate your diet?
Cut down on all the meat and sweets...
On second thought, maybe you could hold back a bit!
It doesn't hurt any more!
Next, I'll take care of your wounds, Levy-san.
I'm fine. Wendy, why don't you rest a bit more?
No! I feel great now that the Tenrou Tree is back the way it was!
But... How did the Tenrou Tree return to normal?
Ultear...
Naw, couldn't be.
You fiend!
Everyone...!
Juvia?
You're safe?
Juvia is so sorry! She let Zeref get away!
Gray-sama, please punish me!
Hit Juvia as much as you want!
I'm not into that!
Yeah, but Juvia is...
W-Whoa...
Then, there's Gildarts...
Yeah.
Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine.
Yeah...
Father...
M-Man!
By the way...
You went and got expelled?
Lame!
Shut up, you old fart!
Gildarts!
Fight me!
You should rest.
In one blow?
Gray-sama! Hurry, hurry!
I'm tellin' you, that ain't my thing!
Wendy... A little help?
Comes in handy...
A Man.
Make sure you get healed up, Lily.
You took more serious damage than I did.
Looks like there's a line.
It's okay! This is when I can be most helpful!
Don't overdo it.
Wendy, switch places.
Erza-san, that outfit...
A nurse?
You don't have any healing power!
Difference in ability doesn't matter during battle, Wendy.
It's your heart that is tested.
Battle?
Hey! Don't go scaring Wendy!
Here she goes...
Now, tell me straight out...
Where does it hurt?
Shall I lower that fever, first?
Or would you prefer an injection?
Great, look what's started...
This is messed up.
No cutting in line, damn it!
Wait in line, you bastards!
Males!
H-Hey... Isn't it good to rest a bit?
Right?
I-Is it because my breasts are too small?
Tying bandages is more difficult than you'd think!
You tryin' to kill us?!
Gray-sama...
To think you'd prefer to be punished rather than punish others!
Juvia is in shock!
Gajeel!
Is it just my imagination, or does the battle with Grimoire Heart already seem far in the past?
Well, this always happens...
That's just how Fairy Tail is!
Master, what shall we do about the exam?
Yes, good question!
Maybe it's best to head back to the guild and clear our heads!
I never could have imagined we would lose...
Can't believe it...
Even though Zeref was right there before us... The World of Great Magic was so close!
Who goes there?
Who is it?
Ones such as yourselves created me...
Wicked minds such as yours summoned Acnologia...
In other words, I am announcing the end of this age.
No one can stop it any longer.
The world comes to an end, here and now.
Zeref...
Oh yeah, I wonder how that blockhead's doing?
Blockhead?
Oh, the guy from the Tower of Heaven!
If I remember, his name was Wally...
Yeah, him!
It's all coming back to me...
Remember? He was all edgy and funny...
Yeah, true... But what's bringing all these memories back?
Intuition.
Next time: The Right To Love.
Enough about the past... You should worry more about whether you passed the exam!
Happy, well said!
10 points!
10 points out of what?
