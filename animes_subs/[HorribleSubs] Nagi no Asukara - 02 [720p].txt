See ya.
S-See you later?
I thought it was pretty.
Huh?
This fish has scales I've never seen before.
Fish?
And you...
This sake is rather weak.
Must be dog piss.
Perfect timing.
My side dish to go with my sake is here.
Um...
What is it?
Take that!
Take that, and that, and that, and that...
This isn't the taste of Mukaido's granny's cooking.
I-I made it.
Oh?
I did something rather rude to you...
and wasted some food on top of that.
Are you... going to curse me?
Episode 2: The Chilly Desert
Good morning!
U-Um...
Th-Thank you for yesterday.
How are you feeling?
Y-Yes, I couldn't be better.
How's he doing?
He?
U-Um,
I'm doing well.
I-I mean...
Thanks for taking care of Manaka yesterday.
Hii-kun?
I'll tell you right now.
Surface people have no business concerning themselves with the Village of the Sea...
Um... Jeez...
Hii-kun!
Hii-kun! That was really rude!
Seriously?
I heard about it! You had a rough time because of him, right?
What? That's not true.
It's because of the surface people!
He's guilty by association!
B-But... Tsumugu-kun saved me!
Tsu-mu-gu-kun?!
Huh? Wh-Why are you so mad?!
You're suddenly sounding so buddy-buddy with him!
Huh?
Th-Then Tsumugu... san?
W-Well, I don't know his last name!
You're acting really strange lately, Hii-kun!
And you're always so angry!
Oh, is that right?
Huh?
What's wrong, Manaka?
Eh?
I-I messed up!
Messed up?
Tsumugu-kun saved me...
But Hii-kun worried about me a lot, too...
and I yelled at him.
I messed up!
Yeah.
Hikari was really worried about you, Manaka.
Chii-chan.
Really worried...
Even though his Ena was dry, and he couldn't breathe that well,
he was really determined...
Y-Yeah...
Hikari isn't really mad.
So try not to be afraid of him.
That'll just annoy him even more.
Okay.
How do you know all this, Chii-chan?
About Hii-kun's feelings and my feelings.
Well... It's because I've been watching you guys since we were little.
Both you...
and Hikari.
Hey, stop, Forehead.
Huh?
You're the two from the other day...
Do you know that woman?
That woman?
Oh.
Do you know her?
She's my older sister.
Liar! You octopus-head!
O-Octopus?
He was calling her by her name.
They've got to be a couple, Miuna.
Uh, I don't really know what's going on here,
but shouldn't you two be in school?
Your teacher's going to get mad...
Don't treat me like a brat, you brat!
I don't need some brat telling me that.
What's wrong?
You brought backup, you cheater!
Seriously, you're one to talk.
Come on, Hikari.
You shouldn't pick on little kids.
Are you okay?
D-Don't touch me with your fishy-smelly hands!
Oh, sorry.
Ow!
Sayu!
Serves you rice dumplings!
The hell?
All right, that's the end of class for today.
Oh, that's right.
Who here wants to try to make an Ojoushi-sama?
What's an Ojoushi-sama?
Do you mean the doll we'd send off in the Ofunehiki?
Right.
Originally, when the Ofunehiki started,
a girl would be sent off as a sacrifice and offered to the Sea God.
Nowadays, instead of an actual girl,
we send off a wooden doll called an Ojoushi-sama.
Why do we have to make an Ojoushi-sama?
Aren't adults supposed to do that kind of stuff?
Oh, I heard they weren't doing the Ofunehiki this year.
Yeah...
that's why we were thinking of doing
something like a voluntary Ofunehiki at our school.
What?
What the heck?
So annoying.
Hikari, calm down.
Is there anyone who wants to do it?
All right, Tsumugu.
Why do we have to...
This is the job of the surface people!
Then you shouldn't have volunteered.
The surface people don't have a clue.
That's why we have to keep an eye on them.
Jeez.
Why did you offer to make this?
My family are fishermen.
We live off the sea, so I wanted the chance to give the proper thanks.
That means we need to do the Ofunehiki.
I heard that Uroko-sama actually exists.
Huh? Yeah.
He's sort of a pervy old man though.
He's sort of in between an old man and a young guy.
I see. So he does exist.
Then what about saltflake snow?
When salt falls down like snow.
Oh, and if sacred fire burns inside the sea,
then how do you actually get it to go out?
You know quite a bit, Tsumugu-kun, about Shioshishio.
Yeah.
On days that are really sunny,
because of the refraction of the light,
there are times when you can just make out the village.
White roofs reflect light among the swells...
Just like the sound of waves,
I can hear singing resound farther, then nearer.
I think the Village of the Sea is great.
For someone on the surface to care so much about the village...
Isn't that great?
What are you talking about?!
Oh, it's about time you sea kiddos headed home.
We'll do the rest.
Thank you.
Bye!
Thanks for your hard work!
Be careful heading home!
Sensei.
I have something to ask of you.
Sensei called us sea kiddos.
That was actually kind of cute.
I sort of get that he's not a bad guy...
But...
Hey, isn't that Akari-san?
Akari?
K-K-K-Ki...
No, Manaka!
I wonder if that's her boyfriend...
She never even mentioned having a guy!
Not to mention a guy from the surface?!
Akari-san is reaching the age when she's old enough to get married.
I wonder if she plans on leaving the village.
What?
There's no way it'd work out with a guy from the surface.
Even if they got married, she'd end up coming right back.
Huh?
That's not possible.
Not possible? Why?
Of course it's not possible!
Because Akari-san looks like she'd make a great mom.
She wouldn't end up coming right back.
That's not what I meant.
If you end up with someone from the surface,
you'll be banished from the village.
Banished?
What the hellthat's an awful thing to say!
What are you yelling at me for?
I believe that rule's been around for a while.
I've never heard of that!
But Satsuki-san from the candy store,
and Koji-niisan from the Hara-san's family
went up to the surface and never came back, right?
Oh...
I always thought that the people who didn't come back
just didn't come back because they threw away the sea...
That's so mean!
Manaka...
There's nothing wrong with wanting to become family with the person that's precious to you.
It's a wonderful thing!
And for them to be chased out of the sea...
Does that mean... you think you want to get with a guy from the surface, too?
S-Stop it!
I hate it when you say perverted things, Hii-kun!
And I hate it when you say perverted things, too, Manaka!
I haven't said anything like that!
You did too!
You're really grossing me out lately!
Manaka, wait!
I understand how you feel, but that was so mean to Manaka...
What do you mean you understand?!
What?
What the hell is with you, always acting like you're the adult?!
You act like you know everything.
What the hell do you know about me?!
Uh...
That really wasn't right. You just took it all out on her.
What?
I understand why you'd get irritated with Manaka, but...
See ya.
What the hell is with those guys?
Repeating that they understand like a broken record.
Even I...
don't really understand exactly how I'm feeling...
The saltflake snow is pretty intense.
And since no one cleans it up...
It would have been nice to be able to stay at Nami Junior High.
So you think things like that, too...
That you want to stay here forever.
It's not that I don't like the people on the surface,
but I want to stay in the sea forever.
With Manaka, you... and Hikari.
You want to stay here just because that's easier, right?
Eh?
If you start longing for other places, it'll become difficult.
If you start longing for other places, it'll become difficult.
It's sort of unexpected.
The fact that Manaka was the first one to take the first step out of here.
Akiyoshi, Ukita, Kamon...
Kihara Tsumugu.
Kihara-kun, Kihara-kun, Kihara-kun...
Now Hii-kun won't get angry.
Kihara-kun...
If they got your DNA, it sucks to be them.
You idiot! You saw the footage! It was super cute!
Oh, man...
H-Hey, Akari...
Today, you...
And this is our baby!
How cute!
Oh, how cute. Does she look more like you?
Aw, it's a girl... I'm envious.
Well, she might have her father's eyes.
Huh?
I wanted a younger sister.
Lately, she started mimicking me. Did you know?
I was totally bummed when you came out.
I didn't, but what does she do?
What was that?!
I really am envious...
If I say me, she'll say me back, and if I say mo, she'll say mo.
But if I say memo...
If you end up with someone from the surface,
you'll be banished from the village.
Your baby will continue to grow.
It's a lot of work, but every day is a lot of fun!
Spoken like a true mother.
What happened to the girl from Shioshishio?
Oh...
She's fine.
I see.
A guy from the surface, huh...
I just... wanted to protect her.
I wanted to protect her like Ena does.
I wanted to protect her from everything that could hurt her.
And yet...
She wants to cast off all of that?
Cast off everything...
And go to the world outside...
I wonder how big the kimono should be.
Oh, um...
Tsumu
Kihara-kun!
What's up?
U-Um...
We were wondering how wide the Ojoushi-sama is around the waist.
One sec.
I wonder why it still sounds pervy...
even when I use his last name.
Oh... It's n-nothing.
How's he doing today?
He... seems to be sleeping today.
I see.
65 centimeters.
Th-Thanks.
So Manaka really does...
Not to mention,
if Manaka were to disappear,
the one next to Hikari would be you.
I'm awful... What am I thinking?
This is...
They apparently used to keep carp there.
Oh! I-I'm sorry.
There was still garbage.
It's a little small for four people to get in.
Four people?
Oh!
I'm sure it'd be annoying always having to consider the time while you work.
Sensei said it'd be fine to use as well.
What? You're going to make a watering hole for us?
Would it be a bother?
N-No! Not at all, thank you!
That's good.
The girl with the really round eyes...
You mean Manaka?
I hope her fish is happy about it, too.
Fish?
Please don't... be so kind to Manaka anymore.
Manaka has...
Hikari.
Curse me, please!
Exactly why do you want to be cursed?
Um, w-well...
because it hurts to lie.
Why are you lying?
Well um...
I'm not sure...
You've always had someone protecting you.
Hikari, Chisaki, and Kaname...
You should have just kept stumbling along behind them.
And now you're trying to go somewhere they can't protect you...
You may need a small lie or two to protect yourself.
Huh?
Please don't!
Stop...
Just get over here, Akari.
You're gonna have to tell us everything in front of Uroko-sama.
Let go of me! I'll tell my dad myself!
What's going on?!
Akari?!
Oh, Hii-kun!
This doesn't concern you two.
Just stay out of
Wait. It's about time they know too.
What?
Just what happens when you break the rules of this village.
What happens? What are you talking about?!
What's the matter?
Dad...
So you've come, Chief Priest.
Akari is seeing a guy on the surface.
Someone saw them.
I'd like you to leave for today.
Chief Priest...
I will talk to Akari myself.
Chief Priest, this is a problem.
If someone from your family ends up leaving for the surface,
it's going to look really bad.
Yes, I know that.
You guys, leave.
Huh? B-But...
Akari...
You're so cute.
You've got horrible taste in guys!
You can say that again.
Did you just fart, Uroko-sama?
Akari's crying because of you!
Episode 3: The Legend of the Sea
A storm's coming.
