Why are we getting off?
Iwato Station Knight s told us to.
The order came from Diamond Citadel.
They said they couldn't allow the Hunters through.
How could they do that?
The Warlord fears Biba-sama.
Iwato's gate is the last fortress before Diamond Citadel.
I suppose it wasn't going to be easy,
That is why we have prepared for this.
They told Biba-sama not to enter.
Does that mean we're going to be separated?
Now we'll be able to get away from them.
But...
Nameless...
Once we get past this, the next stop is Diamond Citadel.
If the track maintenance doesn't delay us, we'll make it in three days.
But without Biba-sama..
Is it true that there are Corpses inside the Master Fortress?
Yes.
And not just one or two.
Probably over a hundred.
Then it's good that we have distanced ourselves from them.
That's true, but...
Ikoma.
I agree that Nameless -san shouldn't be there with them either.
She's...
I know.
I promise to bring her back.
Ayame-san.
It's time.
I am counting on you.
If this plan succeeds, everyone is going to be able to be happy.
Indeed.
But we need your help in order to do that.
Are you up for it?
Of course.
Lord Maeda has agreed to a meeting.
However...
Just as I had predicted.
Get ready.
Okay.
Nameless...
That poor girl.
You lied to her, didn't you?
I did not lie.
Either way...
What I have to do as well.
You decided to use me first because Nameless has returned, didn't you?
Am I...
Maeda-sama...
It is only natural for the Headquarters to work for the people.
In any case...
If I hadn't, they would not have agreed to see Biba here.
You will be seeing Biba-sama?
He said he wanted to discuss something about food provisions.
I'd like to accommodate him, but...
Maeda-sama is unfamiliar with the feud between Biba and the Warlord.
He has put that behind him.
Otherwise, he wouldn't have spent 10 years...
If he hadn't...
he wouldn't have spent the last 10 years fighting the Corpses for the Headquarters.
They're so stupid.
Did they think these men would be able to stop us?
You must not be so overconfident, Nameless.
Those who underestimate their enemies will not last long in this world.
Death comes swiftly and unexpectedly.
Don't worry.
That day won't come for us until we bring my brother back to his home.
Ikoma!
They have arrived.
It is an honor to meet you.
I am the commander of the Hunters...
Nameless -san is here too?
It is an honor.
I finally get the chance to meet the Great Liberator.
Please, have a seat.
Thank you.
Stop, Itagaki!
Biba-dono has come to talk!
He can still talk with a gun pointed at him.
Please sit down.
Brother!
I'd like to go to the toilet!
Toilet?
Hurry up, I can't hold it much longer.
Could I ask that someone take her?
Did you really see Nameless?!
Yeah!
She was with Biba!
Biba too?!
What is it?!
There!
It's Nameless!
It's almost time.
Yes.
They will be paid back in full.
If I'd kill them, Ikoma wouldn't shut up about it.
I better not kill them if I don't want Ikoma yelling at me.
What?
Who authorized this?
It's not fair that they're only keeping us out.
I'm not letting them treat us that way.
Nameless!
What are you doing?!
I'm just letting the Master Fortress in!
After everything we've done fighting the Corpses all this time...
T he Corpses?!
Why?
It's the Corpses!
The Corpses are coming!
Raise the bridge!
Get the explosives!
It's the Corpses!
The Corpses broke trough!
The tocsin?
Why are the Corpses here?!
Itagaki-sama!
Stop!
How brave.
I will stop her.
Yukina-san!
Did you deceive me...?
Did you deceive me, Biba?!
Your master is the one... who deceived me first.
Why are the Corpses here?
Help!
No.
This can't be happening.
Nameless!
Get back here!
Ikoma, we can deal with her later!
We need to get back to everyone first.
Come on!
Yeah.
Get away from the door!
Hurry!
Don't break formation!
Hold back the Corpses!
Ikoma!
Has Ayame-sama returned?
Not yet.
Even if we returned to the Iron Fortress, without the master key...
I will go.
Hold down the fort here.
This all...
Don't worry.
We're together.
Are you okay?!
Don't be afraid...
Wait!
What are you thinking, doing something like this?
One needs fuel to accomplish anything.
Please come with us, Ayame-sama.
Allow me to treat my friend.
Ayame-sama!
Where has our lord gone?
You don't think he left us behind?
A Railfort?
Who's operating it?
Who cares?
We're saved!
Don't get left behind!
This station is done for!
We have to get to Diamond Citadel!
Fire.
This is retribution...
Fireless.
Come.
Are you shaking?
I'm only scared... because you're scared of me.
Me... scared?
You are always afraid.
What was that?
That's...
It's a Black Cloud!
Chimera is such an appropriate name.
A man-made hybrid colony with a Corpseless at its heart.
This is so exciting.
How much will it be able to do?
I will liberate everything.
The land... the people...
Fireless.
Destroy the gate.
Fire!
Kajika-chan!
Don't worry, everyone will protect us.
Damn it!
Take the tank!
Okay!
Diamond Citadel, this is Iwato!
A Black Cloud has!
Very nice.
We will be able to use that.
Diamond Citadel will not stand a chance!
Brother!
Nameless.
Good work.
Brother, wasn't the purpose of opening the gate to let the Master Fortress in?
So why...?
Look, Nameless.
This is...
Fireless?
Is that Fireless?
This is sooner than I expected.
It seems the restraints could not withstand the virus.
Soue-sama, we should give the white blood to Fireless -dono.
It's no use!
There's no bringing her back from this point
Kurusu!
I have come to take back Ayame-sama!
Hey, out of my way!
Stop!
If you do not stop, I will throw this over!
Ayame-sama!
Quit that!
You don't even know what that's worth, foolish gir!
Stop!
Kurusu!
F-Fireless... dono...?
Corpse...
F Fire!
What the hell... is that?
Protect the commander!
Fireless, stop!
No...
What are you!
Ikoma!
Do not resist.
We are interested in your blood.
Resist and we will simply kill you to get it.
Behold!
This is the world that has been liberated from its cage!
I speak to all of you.
Abandon the stations...
There's no mistaking that you have been bitten by a Corpse.
No way...!
Help me!
Stop!
I told you not to move.
Do it.
What are you doing?
What is it?! What is the meaning of this?!
Young master's orders.
To make sure you do not interfere.
The commander ordered us to make sure you do not interfere.
It is here where...
That is the way of this world!
Biba!
Therefore, we...
Liberation!
Liberation!
Liberation!
Liberation!
Liberation!
Liberation!
Brother...
was everything you ever told me...
Are you human or a Corpse?!
I'm neither!
I'm a Corpseless!
I will remember that day
Losing myself
In steam
Countless mistakes are made
When I can't see anything ahead
You said
Ask your own burning blood
Answer my beat
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress
Stand up
And slam everything onto the ground
My soul is devoted to my friend
Burn your life
Change the world
Even if the stars
That connect you make a sound
There are just dreams in the same rain
And lights are dried up
I am tired of getting answers
By mimicking others
Dawn without the sun
And broken morning
Smashed cry and dream The ideal only has its doors
City is uplifted and drown in noise
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder
To hush silence
Chapter Nine
Fang of Ruin
