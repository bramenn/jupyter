Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Gray Fullbuster...
You are far stronger than the information I gathered would imply...
Gray!
I have to hurry and...
Gray, hang in there!
Or perhaps his feelings for his friends strengthened his magical powers?
Natsu, wake up!
The world is spinning...
You joined a splendid guild, Erza...
Destiny!
Charging towers are in place!
No anomalies!
Activating transference lacrima!
Preparing magic power compressors!
Beginning target status updates!
Space-time coordinates set!
Shall we charge the elements?
Wait until merger is complete!
Hurry calculating the compression!
Satellite Square, prepare for transfer!
Preliminary movement, check!
Beginning elemental merger!
Mountain's effect on wavelength, large!
Recalculating space-time coordinates!
It's no use... I can't move a finger...
I guess I used up too much of my magical power.
It doesn't look like Juvia can move either.
What are we going to do?
We had our butts licked good...
Oh, someone's collapsed over there.
That voice!
I found you.
Wait, we're not enemies anymore!
Magical power 60 charged!
Etherion elements 47 merged!
27 minutes until arrival above target!
To think we'd be pressured into this course of action
while the Council Chair is ailing...
It cannot be helped.
While the Chair is absent, it is us 9 who are responsible for the stability of the magical world.
Do not worry so much, Org.
Even if we are attacking another country with magic unprovoked,
we can justify it under clause 27, paragraph 4 of the National Security and Safety Act!
This isn't a matter of law.
We are about to fire Etherion.
We're doing evil!
It's Zeref who is the true evil here.
We can only pray that Etherion will be our saving grace and destroy Zaref!
It won't be long, Lord Sieg...
Yes.
The dream you've had for 8 years will become a reality.
Are you not afraid, Ultear?
No, not even a little.
Because I always have complete faith in you, Lord Sieg.
I suppose so. There is no danger to your life.
True...
I am shaking a little...
If I fail, then I will be annihilated.
What?
But this is very much worth risking one's life for.
Because this is my dream.
Yes.
Another 25 minutes, then?
I'll never see you again.
Jellal!
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!
How dare you trick us!
Sho!
You hurt Sister!
Enough! Calm down!
Let me out of here!
It's okay!
I will protect you!
For sure!
Sho!
I am named Ikaruga.
Who are you?
Outta my way! Who is this crazy broad?
Oh, my! Aren't you unrefined?
I don't have any business with you!
Imposs... ible!
There is nothing which I cannot cut.
What are you, some street performer?
What is this? My body...
I severed your nerves without cutting your clothes or flesh.
That is the essence of the New Moon School.
Sho!
Sister...
Oh, so that is where you were, Miss Erza...
Let me out of here this instant!
She is not an opponent you can defeat!
Don't worry... That card is protected.
There is no way anything from the outside could harm you.
Oh?
That sounds like a challenge.
Sho, get me out of here!
That is not a normal sword she has!
Don't worry... Believe in me...
See?
She sliced through the spatial divide?
Sister...
Thanks to you, your sword made distortions in this space.
That's how I managed to cut my way out.
A sword that can cut through the spatial divide is amazing enough,
but to use the enemy's slices in that split second...
This is Titania's power...
You called yourself Ikaruga, yes?
I have no use for you.
Begone.
In lieu of an introduction...
No way!
Oh? Did you perhaps not see it?
That at which you gaze...
Trying so hard to find Jellal,
you no longer see the flash of swords all around you.
Yes, yes... Those are the eyes...
She's getting serious now!
I am no mere passerby.
That is how it seems.
You are an enemy.
Come at me.
Heaven's Wheel, Circle Sword!
New Moon School.
Demon Flash.
All the swords were...
New Moon School.
Sister!
Garuda Flame!
The Flame Empress Armor?
That armor has the ability to defend against flames, yes?
You do well to requip in such an instant.
You mustn't let his lordship see you looking like that, yes?
What will you do? Will you don your strongest armor soon?
Damn monster...
You'd best repent!
Purgatory Armor, Requip!
There is no one that can stand when faced with this visage!
So that's your strongest armor?
Come at me.
Do you not yet understand?
No matter what armor you don, you cannot win against my sword.
Give up, now.
S-She can't win...
She can't win!
Wait, what's that armor?
Or wait, it's some outfit?
What are you trying?
That outfit is nothing but cloth.
What?
Do you think so little of me?
Sister, what are you doing?
You've got to have a lot of strong armor left, right?
You're stronger than this, right?
I am...
I am not strong.
Strength is...
I like being by myself.
I feel uncomfortable around other people.
Then why are you crying all by yourself?
Before my eyes, countless numbers of my friends have become sacrifices.
I wasn't able to protect those dear to me.
And then...
I wasn't crying!
I was always crying.
To be seen as strong...
I always wear armor because I am weak!
I could never take it off...
I will cut down my opponents, even if they are naked.
I believed that the armor would protect me.
But I was mistaken.
That armor blocked the space that separates people's hearts from one another.
Fairy Tail taught me this...
It taught me how close people are to one another... How warm they are...
Sister...
I am lost no longer!
I will turn my entirety to strength and have at you!
This battle is over.
Impressive...
Wow! You really are amazing, Sister!
Are you unharmed, Sho?
Yes, somehow...
This is the first time I've lost since I entered the guild...
But you and Jellal will all lose...
What's that supposed to mean?
15 minutes...
The light of justice...
That poem is dreadful...
Is she talking about Etherion?
Sho, take Simon and the others plus all the people from Fairy Tail,
and get away from this tower!
B-But...
Will you do as I ask, Sho?
Yeah...
What about you?
I will finish this.
Huh?
Are you awake, Natsu?
I remember I was caught by some weird moving vehicle and...
Stop! You can't get nausea from memories!
After that you were eaten by Fukuro,
and Gray had to save you.
Gray?
But Gray took a lot of damage.
Erza...
You're heavy...
Gray, you got fat.
Shut it...
That cat is taking him out of here.
Satellite Square?
Don't joke about that!
We have to evacuate!
But we'll be caught by the Fiore army!
That'd be better than getting hit by Etherion!
The ships are leaving...
Look below you!
I found a ship!
That's the one we came in on.
I can't believe this!
I lost, and Gray won?
You didn't really lose.
You were eaten.
He's gonna hold this over me for a month!
He's really petty like that...
Damn it!
Come on now...
There's only one thing to do!
Revenge! I'll fight that birdbrain again and get my revenge!
We don't have time for that!
Oh yeah... Who are you?
Simon.
An old friend of Erza's.
Oh, okay. Nice to meetcha.
You're injured?
Don't worry about me.
Listen carefully, Natsu.
Wally sent me a message before.
He said he found Lucy and Juvia collapsed, along with a defeated member of Trinity Raven.
Lucy?
They didn't know what was going on,
so they took your two friends outside the tower.
Weren't these the enemy?
But Simon said they're our allies.
So then, why is she tying me up and dragging me?
And I've already been contacted by Sho that Trinity Raven have all been defeated.
I didn't do a thing!
All that's left is Jellal himself.
Erza is heading toward him now.
Erza?
She is trying to end this all by herself.
Those two have been connected by fate for 8 years.
Their destiny may be to do battle.
However Jellal is too powerful.
Please... Save Erza.
Hell no.
What?
My, oh my...
The game is already over?
Is playing with people's lives so fun for you?
It is fun.
Birth and death, after all, are the origin and focus of all emotions.
Or to put it the other way around, nothing is more boring than living on its own.
It has been a while, Erza...
Jellal...
I will liberate my past friends.
Do as you please.
I no longer need them.
The Tower of Heaven has been completed.
Even though it will be destroyed in less than 10 minutes?
You speak of Etherion?
Such confidence... So it was a bluff?
No.
Etherion will rain down.
Hearing that makes me feel relieved.
If I can delay you by 10 minutes, then this will all be over!
No.
You will be annihilated as Zeref's sacrifice.
It has already been decided!
That is your fate.
Your destiny!
Damn it! Turn the ship around!
I can't do that, okay?
We were told to get away from here.
But Erza is still inside...
And Natsu, too!
I'm sure she will be fine.
I have to trust her.
I can't leave her to just Natsu!
There's nothing to be done.
Simon is also with him... They'll handle it somehow.
Somehow? What's that supposed to mean?
Don't yell!
Everyone, calm down!
Shut up! Turn the boat around now!
I've got to save Erza!
Hurry, there's no time!
I said it's no use!
Shut up!
What's with you? I want to go back, too!
But there's no point...
Etherion will fire any moment!
I just know that Natsu will bring Erza back!
That's what Simon told me!
If Salamander's true power awakens, even Jellal wouldn't...
Damn you!
Are you saying you aren't going to save Erza, your comrade?
Erza needs to defeat her own enemies.
It's not something I should butt in to.
No.
Erza cannot win against Jellal.
Oh, yeah?
Don't put her down!
That's not it!
I'm not talking about power or magic here...
Yeah?
Erza is still trying to save Jellal.
I know.
I know that she could never truly hate Jellal.
Jellal is clever.
He will use those emotions of hers.
And that's not the worst of it.
You know that the Council is trying to fire Etherion on this location, right?
If that happens, every human in this tower will be destroyed.
According to Sho's message, we only have 10 more minutes.
What?
She headed to face him alone after telling everyone to evacuate.
You know Erza well, yes?
I don't want to believe it, but she may be trying to use Etherion to take Jellal with her...
Why didn't you tell me that first?
Where is Erza?!
Seven more minutes.
Seven more minutes and Etherion will rain down here.
Let's have fun for the next seven minutes, Erza.
Right now, I fear nothing.
Even if Etherion comes, I will be satisfied to take you with me!
Oh? Take me with you?
Go ahead and try!
You finally finished the tower, and now you're destroying it? Don't you care, Jellal?
A pillar or two are nothing but decoration.
Sho and the others believed in you for eight years to make those decorations!
Stop complaining about every little thing I say.
The important thing is the R-system. These eight years were for that.
And that... is complete!
It does seem you have improved a bit, but I guess that's your limit.
This isn't like you, Ms. Erza...
We'll lend you a hand.
Even you get scared sometimes, right?
We're on your side, no matter what Erza!
Aye, we're the strongest team!
I believed in you, Erza. I always did for these past 8 years.
Sister...
Everyone...
When we get back, fight me!
I thought I'd told you... Right now, I fear nothing!
Is this really the same Erza?
So this Satellite-something everyone's so worried about is what exactly?
Satellite Square! And why don't you know?
It's an extremely powerful destructive spell that can destroy an entire city easily.
Wait, we're in deep trouble if we get hit by that!
Next time: A Prayer Under the Holy Light.
This won't do! Where is Erza?
I pray that Natsu gets some common sense.
