I have a copy of this, too.
So Yamamoto-san also reads poetry books...
Nana, hurry up and give it!
Ah, yeah!
Nana!
Yes?!
Are you waiting for someone?
A-Ah, nope...
Then let's hurry up and go already.
The lunch counter's gonna get crowded.
Y-Yeah.
I guess you're right.
What am I gonna do...?
Usotsuki na anata nakimushi no atashi
Doushite umaku ikanai wa
Oshare shita kami mo rain suton no tsume mo
Anata wa kidzuki mo shinai ne
Love kanashii namida nanka ja nai yo

Kono unmei bakari I love

Why can't things go well between
the liar, you, and the crybaby, me?
You don't notice my styled hair
or my nice set of press-on nails.
Love isn't about the unhappy tears that go along with it.
Those tears only leave my eyes dry and hurt me.
I love this destiny
between only you and only me.
I want to accept your hot feelings
and be taken by you forever.
Despite your uncute, tearful face and your shortness, I still love you.
Episode 10 ...
I'm sure Yamamoto-san's upset, since she lost the picture...
I have to get it back to her.
But I can't find the right time to talk to her...
And...
What? You also had a copy of it?
I don't understand...
Ah... someone just went to throw the trash in the incinerator.
Were you looking for something?
No...
You serious?
Hey, listen to this! You won't believe what he did!
Come on, shut up!
Just spill it!
Nana-chan.
Let me see your English homework.
Again? You need to do it yourself sometimes, you know.
Please?
Sheesh.
All right. Thanks a lot.
Ah, I'm... getting jealous again...
Nana-chan, is something bugging you?
It's like you haven't been able to relax all day.
N-Not really.
I guess that's fine, then.
But remember, no secrets between us.
That's not fair... with just one smile, I'll let you do whatever you want.
Go ahead and take my homework.
You're gonna be called on today, right?
Really? Yay!
That's why I want him all to myself...
Oh, now I get it!
That picture... wasn't of Yano. It was picture of Yamamoto-san's sister!
I see! It all connects now!
It makes sense for Yamamoto-san to have it.
Huh?
Did you do the English assignment?
I've got it down pat.
Oh, no!
Let me see it?
No.
My English notebook!
Nana-chan's notebook is only for me.
That's... mine.
Give it back.
Is this some sort of harassment?!
Yano.
U-Umm...
In my notebook before...
Umm...
W-Was there maybe.. a picture in it?
A picture of what?
Ah... never mind. If you didn't see it, don't worry about it.
I gave it back.
I gave it back to Yamamoto.
Ah... I see...
Umm... did Yamamoto-san say anything about it...?
Not a word.
Umm, nothing like where'd you find it or anything?
Nothing like that.
Ah... I see...
He's...
Yano...
Nana-chan... why'd you have that?
He's really mad at me...
Snooping around in other people's things is pretty awful, don't you think?

The seven-colored rainbow knows where our love is headed.
As the seasons turn, the night sky I gaze up at
surrounds me, and illusions dance above the clouds.
I tried to find where it led, but it only colored my sighs.
I need to reach out and touch it before it fades away.
The palm of your hand is filled with warmth.
Don't let go just yet. Everything seems about to fall apart.
As my heart wavers, tears fall from my eyes.
Your face in my mind
twinkles brightly and silently.
Your eyes before me
sing in the wind of the one I dream of.
When I'm lost, I feel really down, and when I think of it...
Every time you smile, the pain piles up.
In the blinding sky...
Let me see your textbook.
Why are you working ten pages ahead?
There's nothing else to do at home.
There's nothing else to do, so you study?
You sure are different.
If you hate me that much, we shouldn't have even gotten to know each other to begin with.
You only used me to get revenge on my sister, anyway.
Revenge?
That wouldn't mean anything, and I'd have no reason to do that.
Ah... sure.
No... never mind.
On second thought...
Let me see yours, Yamamoto.
Thank you.
Nana, you're not gonna buy those clothes you just tried on?
They looked so good on you, too.
I'm broke.
Then why did you invite me to go shopping?
Did you have a fight with Yano?
What's Yano doing today?
Pretty awful...
I wasn't really snooping around...
Yano can be really cold sometimes...
He hasn't called me, even though it's Sunday...
It's Yano!
It is Yano.
Hello-
Hello? Hi there!
Nice to meet you! Are you Yano's girlfriend?
Huh?
I went to the same middle school as Yano.
We're at Take's house right now.
Yano's throwing him a birthday party today.
Wanna come over?
Ah... sure... but I'm out shopping with a friend right now...
A friend?! Is she female?!
That sounds great! Bring her with you!
We'll make a whole hook-up party out of this!
W-What?
By the way, is your friend cute?
Hey, what are you doing with my cell?
Yano's voice!
Huh? I was thinking of making a hook-up party.
Are you a moron?
Hello?
Ah, Ya-
You don't have to come.
H-He hung up on me...
Ah, you really came?!
You son of a bitch.
Have a seat, heave a seat!
That annoyed look was blatantly obvious.
What'll you have to drink?
We have everything, since he runs a liquor store.
Want some sake?
Just kidding, just kidding!
Moron.
Why don't you sit next to Yano?
Ah, no... here's fine.
You don't have to hold back.
Hey, Yano.
I'm getting kinda tired. Maybe I should head back?
Ah, that little... he's ignoring me!
For being my boyfriend, he's really ruining things!
Ah, that reminds me...
I thought coming empty-handed might seem rude, so I bought you a present, Takeuchi-kun.
Huh? You don't have to.
A-Ah, don't mention it. It's nothing special, so, umm...
Don't expect too much.
Thanks. What could it be?
It's a cellphone strap.
Sign: Sea Urchin-kun
Was it a bit too corny...?
No... I think I actually kinda like it.
Really?! Thank goodness!
I had a really hard time choosing, so that's great to hear!
Cheers!
Ch-Cheers...
This is bad...
You're too transparent, Yano!
Ah... let's try to nonchalantly change the topic...
By the way, it's that, isn't it?
A-Ah, yeah! It is, isn't it?
It's the season for sea urchins, right?
You didn't change the topic one bit!
Take! Take!
Keep going with the topic change!
Just like you always do! You're good at it!
Sea urchins?
You jealous of the sea urchin?
What are you doing?!
What was that?
You're jealous, aren't you?
You've had such a bored look on your face this whole time.
I'm not jealous at all of that weird strap.
Weird?!
Then why don't you find a different look?
It's my birthday, you know.
I'm sympathizing with you.
Getting such a lame sea urchin like that.
Lame?!
You're just pitiful, getting so happy over it.
What's this? You're obviously just jealous.
Yano... be an adult about this.
I can't believe you!
What the hell are you doing?!
Throwing away someone's present like that... you're scum!
The world doesn't revolve around you, Yano!
Think about what you did!
I'm leaving!
Wait, Takahashi!
Where's my sea urchin?
Hell if I know.
Takahashi!
You don't have to take me home!
Wait up.
You're annoying. Go away, you bastard.
The world may not revolve around me...
Didn't you say that?
But what you just did was a mistake.
You can't do that sort of stuff, Yano.
I don't need anything that won't be mine.
Sometimes...
Then, you don't need me...?
Really cold...
Don't you need me?
There's something wrong with you being unable to believe in people.
Have you ever believed in someone and been betrayed by them?
Have you?
You'll never...
Yano, you're not fair.
Takahashi.
It's okay if you don't understand.
Didn't you throw it out the window...?
I threw a peanut.
I'm sorry. I got jealous.
It annoys me.
I want one, too.
But you said it was weird and lame.
Despite that, I want one.
He didn't deny it...
Here.
Give it to Takeuchi sometime when I'm not watching.
Can I ask for something else out of selfishness?
Yeah.
Don't be nice to any other guys when I'm around.
Is it okay if you're not looking?
Takahashi, I know you don't want to, but please.
Try to read between the lines here. Please.
And one more thing.
I love you.
So...
Don't go anywhere.
The starry sky looks just like the planetarium...
If a shooting star whizzed by, what would you wish for?
I wish to become rich as soon as possible.
Please don't talk about unrealistic dreams.
They're just dreams.
What about you?
Me?
I'd...
Oh, I like that.
Umm... me too.
I'd wish to be your first and your last.
Why do you always attach that stuff to what I say?
And you say that pretty easily, but do you know what it really means?
Yeah.
To be together with you until you die.
Do you swear it?
I swear it on the stars.
If there's a shooting star, I wish to be with Nana-chan forever.
Takahashi, I'm sorry!
I'm really, really sorry!
I can't seem to find the sea urchin anywhere.
I looked for it all night, but I couldn't find it at all.
I'm sorry.
Yano only pretended to throw it out.
I see.
I'm sorry, too.
I should've told you sooner.
No... I'm just glad I didn't lose it.
Ah, but I won't put it on my cellphone.
He'd probably get the wrong idea if I did.
I-I'm really sorry about this, and for making you have to do that...
Bye!
Takeuchi-kun is... Takeuchi-kun is...
My heart's squeezing in delight?
Not that!
Did you say something?
Nope, not a thing...
It'd be nice if Yano tried taking some pointers from Takeuchi-kun...
By the way, Yano...
You're kind of like my boy cousin.
He's only five, but he always gets in my shirt and hugs me.
Perverted little runt.
It's not like that. He just want to touch me.
When I carry him around, he gets really happy.
And he's only happy if a girl does it.
Even though the three-year-old girl doesn't do that at all...
Yano?
So I'm the same as a five-year-old brat?
I wonder If I hurt his pride?
There's nothing to worry about. It's just me here.
I'll give you a hug, so why don't you come on over?
As I thought, he really is the same as a five-year-old.
Motoharu.
Yes?
Some girl from school is waiting outside for you.
I wonder if she's here to confess her love?
That kind of pisses me off...
And it kinda looks like he's used to this!
I'll be back in a minute!
Yes, yes.
Makes me wonder...
Don't you want to know...

I wonder if I'm reflected
in your precious eyes?
I wonder how I can always be happy
on the windowsill where the sunshine always falls?
I hide my true feelings and the thumping of my heart.
As always,
the pain of not being able to understand each other burns.
I want to smile, I want to smile, down to the core of my heart.
I'll open up to you
about how I pretend to be strong, about how I'm weak,
about what happened yesterday,
about everything that means nothing.
I'll continue to love you forever.
Take my arm and let's walk. Yeah!
The seasons leave only me behind
and take my precious person away, don't they?
I look for you, I look for you,
I'm always looking for you,
but when I find that person, is it really you?
I'm so sad, I'm so sad,
I could cry.
How much feeling must I give to be able to embrace you?
Ah, I want to smile, I want to smile.
Throwing everything...
Episode 11 Preview...
You... haven't forgotten about Onee-chan at all.
You betrayed both me and her at the same time.
Everything is going the way you want it to, isn't it?
Are you satisfied with yourself now?
Go home.
I love you, more than anyone else in the world.
That's why, Yano... talk to me.
No matter what happened...
