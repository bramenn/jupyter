The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Oh, yeah! Can you hear this voice?
Oh, yeah! It's hoarse from yelling.
Oh, yeah! Until your heart can hear it...
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
The moon and sun high-five.
Are you sure you're not forgetting something?
When you're not here to make me laugh,
even what I'm looking for can't be found.
Snowing, be honest with yourself and smile,
because when two people lay close, time overlaps.
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Don't say goodbye!
Last time on Fairy Tail!
But, why?!
You wanna go?!
So these are Fairy Tail wizards?
Erza's coming!
Erza?!
Erza? You mean...
The strongest wizard in Fairy Tail...
Like this, basically.
I was captured.
Give Happy back!
What? I don't get it.
Lullaby?
Mira-chan, three beers over this way, if you please!
Coming!
Come on, go out on a date with me, Mira-chan.
Don't start with this again.
But, Dear...
You have a wife, don't you?
Please stop that, Mira-chan!
One of these days I'd like to drink in peace.
You drink too much.
I've got to do some job sooner or later.
Aye. We're running out of food money.
Man, I wish we had that 2,000,000 jewel now.
Now that I think about it, I'm not going to make my rent for next month!
I've got to do a job, too!
The Armored Wizard!
Looking for a magic bracelet...
Dispel the magic on this cursed cane...
Fortune Telling using Astrology.
A Monster Hunt in a volcano?!
There sure are a lot of things wizards are requested to do.
If one suits your fancy, just tell me.
Master is off at the regular meeting.
Regular meeting?
All the guild masters in the area get together and give regular reports.
It's different than the council meetings, though.
Reedus, can I borrow a light pen?
Oui.
The light pen.
A magic item that allows you to write in the air.
The people on top of the world of magic are the 10 members of the council, connected with the government.
Their job is to bring order to everything that goes on in the world of magic.
And on the chance that a wizard commits a crime, they pass judgment on them.
Then below them are the organization of guild masters, the Guild Master Leagues.
They circulate the decrees of the council,
smooth out communication between the guilds in the same area, and keep us unified.
It's a pretty tough job.
I had no idea that the guilds were connected like that.
Keeping the guilds in alliance is very important.
If you're not careful...
Those dark guys are coming!
Gotcha!
Don't scare me like that!
It's true though.
Those dark guys really exist. Dark guilds.
Meaning, guilds that don't belong to the league.
Those guys sometimes have their hands in illegal, villainous activities.
Anyway, hurry up and pick a job.
And who are you to tell me that, anyway?
'Cause we're a team, right?
We picked the last job ourselves, remember?
This time it's your turn, Lucy.
You've got to be kidding me.
Our team is history, obviously.
You'd didn't care as long as it was some blond girl, remember?
That's not the only reason.
I chose you, Lucy... because you're cool!
What?
No need to lock it down now. You'll get more team requests than you can stomach soon!
Gray, your clothes.
Shuddap.
Did you just tell me to shuddap, you flamer!
'Cause your blabbin's pissin' me off, porn star!
Birdbrain!
Slippery bastard!
Get outta my face!
You stink!
Here they go again.
Lucy, how about the two of us form the team of love?
Tonight. Just the two of us.
You really are beautiful.
I must gaze at you through sunglasses.
If I took them off, I'd go blind for sure.
Sounds like a plan.
W-Wait... You're a Celestial Wizard?
Huh?
Yeah. She's got, like, a cow and a crab.
Fate, what cruel tricks you play on me!
I'm sorry! We're going to end it here for now!
Did we start something in the first place?
Loke has issues with Celestial Wizards.
There's a rumor that he had some women trouble a while back.
Oh, figures...
Could you guys give it a rest!
He picked this fight! You think I'm not gonna pay him back?
Then put on some clothes.
You're the one who provoked me, droopy eyes!
When exactly did I provoke you, squinty eyes!
Talking underpants!
Dimwit!
It's third-grader time.
Same as always.
We've got trouble!
Erza's back!
Erza-san... Natsu mentioned her before.
I think it'd be correct to call her the strongest female wizard in all of Fairy Tail right now.
It's Erza.
That's Erza's footsteps.
Erza's comin' back!
With this kind of reaction, Erza-san really must be an amazing wizard.
Scary!
I have returned.
Is Master here?
S-She's pretty!
I see.
Erza-san, what is that giant thing?
The horn of the monster I defeated.
The locals decorated it and gave it to me as a souvenir.
Got a problem with it?
No, not at all!
Think she knows about the incident on Mt. Hakobe?
C-Crap, I'm dead meat.
She's quite different than what I'd imagined.
All of you!
I heard a bunch of rumors while I was gone.
About how Fairy Tail keeps causing problems.
Master might forgive you, but I will not!
Cana!
How dare you drink in such an undignified manner!
Visitar.
Yes?
Take your dancing outside.
Wakaba.
You're dropping ash on the table.
Nab!
Just hesitating in front of the Request Board as usual?
Take a job!
Macao!
Say something, damn it!
Man, you all give me such trouble.
I'll let it slide today without saying anything.
It seemed like she said plenty already...
Is she like a disciplinary committee or something?
That'd be Erza.
Well, she has a sharp tongue, but she looks human enough.
Is she really all that scary?
Are Natsu and Gray here?
Aye!
Hey Erza. The both of us are getting along great today, as always!
Aye!
Natsu's acting like Happy!
I see. Well, even the best of friends fight at times.
But I like it most seeing the two of you get along.
Um, best friends is a little...
Aye...
I've never seen Natsu like this!
Natsu challenged Erza to a fight before and was beat to a pulp.
You mean Natsu?
And Gray got beat to a pulp when she saw him walking about naked.
When Loke courted Erza, she beat him to a pulp.
He reaped what he sowed, though.
Oh, so she's like that.
Natsu, Gray, I have a favor to ask.
I heard a troubling story after I finished this job.
Honestly speaking, this is something for Master to decide, but I want to settle it quickly so I decided myself.
I want the two of you to lend me your power.
Will you come with me?
What's this mean?
Erza asked the two of them for help?
This has never happened before...
We're leaving tomorrow morning.
Make preparations.
Make a team...
Erza, Natsu, and Gray...
I never would have imagined it before...
But this might be Fairy Tail's ultimate team!
And then...
Magnolia Station.
Why'd I have to be stuck with you?
That's my line!
If Erza wants help, I can handle that by myself!
Then go by yourself!
I don't even want to go!
Then stay home, and get beaten up by Erza afterwards!
And why do you always walk around with that bedroll?
Pretend we don't know them.
Pretend we don't know them.
Why are you here, Lucy?
So I have something to sleep on, duh!
Because Mira-san said...
Those two are totally going to fight when Erza isn't looking.
So please stop them, okay?
Me?
You're not stopping them.
But...
I apologize. Were you waiting?
Erza-san!
Nice packing.
That's a lot of luggage!
Let's get along together today!
Aye, sir!
And here comes Happy 2!
Yes. Getting along is the best.
And you are?
I believe you were at Fairy Tail yesterday.
I'm the new recruit, Lucy.
Mira-san asked that I come along with you.
Thanks for having me!
I am Erza. Glad to have you on board.
Oh, so you're Lucy?
You're the one who defeated the guerrilla mercenaries with just one finger, yes?
You have my thanks for offering to help.
I'll be counting on you.
That's quite different from what actually happened...
G-Glad to be of service...
Erza, I have one condition for coming along.
Hey!
What? Tell me.
When we get back, fight me!
Hey, think it over!
You have a death wish?
It won't go the same as last time.
I'm good enough to beat you now!
It's true that you have improved.
I am not confident by any means, however...
Fine.
I'll take you on.
All right! I'm all fired up!
Man, what a loser.
This is how you get after picking a fight?
It happens every time, though. Must be tough on him.
You poor thing.
Come, sit next to me.
Aye!
So, you're telling me to move?
I'll let you rest.
Aye!
This way it's a bit easier on him.
Pretending not to see
No, she is definitely a bit weird.
Erza, isn't it about time you told us?
What are we supposed to be doing?
Our opponents are the dark guild, Eisenwald.
They intend to do mischief with some magic called Lullaby.
Lullaby?
Then, those guys from before...
The dark guild, Eisenwald.
Seems we got a message from Kageyama.
He finally got that item we've been wanting.
Our time has finally come.
This is our only chance to accomplish our objective.
Now, while those old geezer guild masters are having their regular meeting.
I see. So you also met some members of Eisenwald?
Well, they did say something about a lullaby.
There's no mistaking it.
They were refugees from Eisenwald.
I suspect they didn't want to follow the plan and were escaping.
So this plan has something to do with Lullaby?
I would imagine so.
That shadow that snatched them up was probably a member of Eisenwald's main force.
They had to make a move to keep their plans from leaking.
What could they be planning?
I'll explain from the start.
On the way back from my previous job...
At the town of Onibas, I stopped at a bar where wizards gather.
Hey, where's the booze?
Pipe down already!
I can't stand it!
We finally found the place Lullaby was hidden, but that damn seal!
We don't have a damned clue!
Keep your voice down!
It's nothing to get upset about.
I'll handle the rest myself, so you go back to the guild.
Koge-chan?
You sure you'll be fine alone?
Tell Erigor-san I'll be back with the lullaby in three days, tops.
Lullaby... Like, a song to get children to sleep?
And the seal he was talking about was thought to be quite a strong spell.
So they were also part of Eisenwald.
Yes. But I foolishly didn't think of it at the time.
Or the name Erigor.
The top ace of the dark guild Eisenwald.
Erigor, who's nicknamed shinigami since he only takes assassination requests.
Assassinations?
Naturally assassination requests are banned by the council.
But Eisenwald wanted money.
And so six years ago they were thrown out of the Wizard's Guild League.
However they don't listen to orders and have continued to operate.
Maybe I should go home...
You're looking juicy all of a sudden.
It's sweat!
I was in error.
If I had noticed the name Erigor back then I would have forced them to suffer and made them tell me their plans!
Scary!
I see.
Eisenwald is planning to do something with this Lullaby.
And it's definitely something evil, so you want to stop them.
Yes.
I do not feel as if I can oppose an entire guild on my own, and that is why I asked for your help.
We're heading straight into Eisenwald!
Sounds interesting.
Aye!
I wish I hadn't come...
Lucy's juicy!
It's sweat!
Come on, give me a discount!
By the way, what kind of magic do you use, Erza-san?
Please, just call me Erza.
Erza's magic is really pretty.
Her opponent's blood goes everywhere!
That's pretty?
I think your magic is prettier than mine, Gray.
Really?
Ice Magic.
Oh, so that's why you two don't get along?
Because Natsu uses flame and you use ice?
Really?
Whatever.
Onibus Station.
Are those guys from Eisenwald still here?
I don't know. But I came here to find out.
Sounds like a wild goose chase to me.
Huh? Where's Natsu?
He departed.
I was so busy telling the story, I forgot about him!
What have I done?
And I know he's bad with transportation.
This is all my fault.
Please, would someone hit me?
Now, now...
Oh? Fairy Tail?
So you're a wizard in one of those legal guilds?
Man, I'm jealous.
Legal guilds ain't all they're cracked up to be, Fairy!
Know what we call you guys?
Flies! Yes, flies!
Whoa there...
Why, you...
Huh? What's with that magic?
Now, this...
That magic!
Now look here, you can't just go pulling the emergency lever.
It's for my ally, please understand.
It's going too far!
Please bring our luggage to the hotel.
Why me?
All the people at Fairy Tail are like this, aren't they?
Not me.
Then where are your clothes?!
It stopped...
Huh, what's this?
You saw it?!
That's enough out of you!
You did a nice one on me back there!
Guard Shadow!
Crap... Damn you...
High Punch!
Uh, that emergency stop was a false alarm.
We will be departing shortly.
Crap! I'm outta here!
Wait right there, you!
You won't get away with hurting a member of Eisenwald!
So you're one of those Eisenwald guys? You talked a lot of trash about Fairy Tail.
Let's finish this outside!
A magic-driven four-wheeler.
It consumes the magic of the driver to increase speed.
Natsu!
Natsu, you okay?
Aye.
That hurt, jerk!
Shut up! You left me behind, huh?
That we did. At least you're unhurt.
Somehow...
That hurt!
What do you mean, unhurt?
I got into a fight with some weird guy on the train.
Some weird guy?
The guy who grabbed those Happy-eaters in the forest.
He said he was part of Eisenwald or something.
You idiot!
Eisenwald are the people we're after!
How could you let him escape from under your nose?
This is the first time I heard about it...
I explained just a moment ago!
Listen to people when they're talking to you!
Um, that's because she knocked him unconscious...
She's totally amazing in so many different ways.
See.
That's Erza for you!
He was on that train, right?
We'll go after him immediately!
What was he like?
Nothing stood out to me, really.
Oh, yeah!
He had this flute shaped like a skull
It was a skull with three eyes.
A three-eyed skull?
That's some bad taste there.
Lucy, what's the matter?
I know about that flute.
Lullaby... The song of curse!
Magic of death!
What?
Song of curse?
You mean like, a magic song?
I've only read about them in books,
but one of the forbidden magics is the curse of death, right?
Right. A black-magic curse that saps the life out of the person it's cast upon.
Lullaby is even worse!
This train is the property of Eisenwald.
Kunugi Station.
Everyone off, drivers and luggage too.
Resist and you forfeit your lives.
Erigor-san.
Kageyama.
I heard you'd be coming back on this train, but looking at the destruction... Did something happen?
Let's talk about that later. First, here.
I managed to lift the seal somehow.
That's...
So this is the forbidden Lullaby?
This flute was originally nothing but a tool used for death curses...
But the great black wizard Zeref transformed it even further into a demon flute.
All those who hear the sound of this flute have the life sucked out of them. The mass-death curse magic, Lullaby!
You're going too fast, Erza!
Even if it's you, don't underestimate the amount of magic it'll drain from you!
We don't have that kind of time!
If Erigor gets his hands on that mass-death curse magic, then...
There's no telling what he'd do!
Damn him... What's he after?
Let's begin! Start the operation!
Take me away to someplace!
Let's ride on a tin horse, just the two of us.
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
It's sad that my beloved doll can't talk to me...
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
Every time I think of you tears start to flow...
I'm a crybaby, aren't I?
In the moon (the moon) at night (at night)
I'm always (I'm always)
searching for the rabbit!
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
so much it's like I'm under a spell.
This love is a monologue
from which I'll never awaken.
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
since I've completely fallen in love.
I wonder what spell I could chant,
to get through to you?
The perfect thing to say.
Spouting this and that,
I just love you like crazy!
One day I want to be able to tell you
I've arrived.
My words of thanks.
There's nothing more to say!
Mira-san, is Erza a scary person?
No, not at all.
Really? Thank goodness.
Although if you make her angry, she'll knock you about 10 meters,
or pound you into the ground up to your neck.
I think that's plenty scary, personally...
Next time: Fairies in the Wind.
Don't worry, you'll get used to it in no time, Lucy.
Natsu and Gray used to make her angry all the time.
You're predicting I'm going to make her angry?
