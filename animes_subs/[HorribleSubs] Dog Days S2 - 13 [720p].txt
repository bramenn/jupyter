Union Fest is over now,
but I would like to create more events
with you all that are as fun as this one was!
Union Fest's final stage.
The passion that connected the three countries
never waned...
That night, the party continued with great enthusiasm
until the end.
Starting tomorrow, we'll return to our usual,
calm and peaceful days.
And then...
Yes?
Hero, you're going out with the Princess and the others, right?
Yes, they're making our lunches right now.
Yeah, I took a peek earlier.
This is for you.
Are these clothes?
I had them made at a shop I frequent.
Try it on. I'm sure it'll suit you.
Wow, this is nice!
It's not bad to wear something other than your Hero outfit, right?
Yeah! But is it really okay for me to have these?
I don't want to take them back. Please wear them.
Now, Hero, this will be your last mission this summer.
Okay!
Relax and enjoy your day today
with the Princess and your friends.
Have fun with the Princess, Rebecca, and the others.
Can you do it?
I will do my best, I swear on my Hero title!
Right, then go!
Hey, Sink!
Your Highness, Nanami!
Sink, where'd you get those clothes?
Ecle gave them to me.
Oh really?
Looks good.
Everybody's here.
Sorry for the wait.
Then, shall we?
The highland picnic tour for the rulers and the Heroes!
Off we go!
This is amazing!
It's nice, isn't it?
This is our favorite summer spot.
The water is really nice and there are even fish.
You're right, there are so many!
And so many local gods...
The protection of the sprites is especially strong here.
That's why nature's bounty is so plentiful here,
but you shouldn't be so impressed quite yet.
We have much more to show you.
Let's take a picture!
A picture with everybody!
Shall we take turns?
First, Nanami and you guys...
Oh, don't worry about that.
Leo-sama, it's okay, right?
Yes. Noir!
Yes, ma'am!
Secret Escort Troop.
At your service!
Okay, Noir, can you take the picture then?
Sure.
All right, there's still plenty of places I want to show you!
Adel-sama, Isuka-dono?
The Hero Crystals I gave to Sink and Gaul...
we never gave you one, Nanami.
Oh, yeah...
You also have the proper qualifications to be a Hero.
We'll make sure to have created one
for you by next time.
Really?! Thank you!
Well, kid, we had quite some experiences,
but it was you and our little shrimp that woke me,
so I'll say thanks.
I'd like to express my gratitude as well.
You've inherited the Demon Crystal!
Make sure to keep training on the other side, as well!
Yes, I'll do my best!
Sorry that I didn't find
a better time to secretly hand this over...
Oh, no.
Really, thank you for making the trip out here.
So anyway, here's what you asked for.
Everyone!
Our rulers and Heroes are about to return!
The surprise Hero farewell party
organized by us young knights...
This has indeed become quite huge.
Yes, Prince Gaul's holding the reins.
The princesses and Heroes are arriving!
Everybody, get ready!
I bet you didn't expect that, did you?!
You were probably thinking of having a light meal,
but we won't allow that!
A surprise party organized by us
young knights to thank our rulers
and Heroes for their hard work.
I bet you never suspected that we had planned this all along!
We didn't!
You got us!
Now rulers and Heroes, please...
Hey, Hina. I'm back.
I got this from the princesses.
Shall we?
Sounds good. I'll have some.
So how was the farewell party?
The young ones all seemed to have fun.
They liked the swords I made, too.
What did you make them?
Small blades for use at home.
An all-around knife
great for cutting fruit or for camping.
Since Rebecca likes cooking, I made her a cooking knife.
You made household blades, eh?
That brings back memories.
You're telling me.
But I got to make nice blades and see nice smiles.
That alone made it worth coming back.
I see.
Captain Riselle!
We're back!
Princess, sorry for the wait.
Don't worry.
Oh, where's Cou-sama?
We both left after getting ready, but she said
she remembered some urgent business.
Oh.
Sink, you're late!
Wha... Cou-sama?!
I wanted to give those two girl talk fans
as much time alone as possible.
So why don't we two inheritors of
the Hero King take a bath together?
That reminds me, Rebecca-san.
Do you think you'll get anywhere with that thing?
Oh, you mean that Sink always calls me Becky?
Yes.
Not at all.
I think I'll always be Becky to him.
To him, I'll always be the girl
that was his little childhood friend.
I don't think that's necessarily true.
Well, it's okay.
Nothing's changed anyway.
Anyway, I think your work will be really hard,
so if you ever need my help, let me know.
I'm Pastillage's Hero, but I am also your best friend.
Yes, thank you.
The same goes for you, any time you need me!
Yes, thank you, Princess.
Sink, you're so good.
Really? Thank you.
All right. Rinsing it out now.
Okay.
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you something.
Yes, what is it?
Do you have any plans to get together
with Rebecca or Millihi-nee, or maybe both?
What?!
You know, if a ruler and Hero get married,
it has some influence on the country ruling business, so...
Uhh.. let's wash your tail first!
Please do!
Well, I'm still just a fledgling Hero, and I haven't
reached my goal yet.
Goal?
Winning against Nanami.
We've had quite a few fights,
but I've never beat her in a serious match
or public event.
Victory!
Oh yeah, you did lose in the one-on-one during the Fest.
Yes...
It's my goal to win against Nanami during
a public event on earth.
Until that's done, I'll always be just a kid.
That's why I think it's too early for things like that.
I see.
Don't forget that you have to take care of those
who stay by your side while you march towards your goal.
You're right.
Thank you, Cou-sama.
I'll make sure to remember that.
Okay.
Rebecca!
Cou-sama!
Was your bath okay?
Sink washed me, so I'm all good.
Ah, a freshly washed Cou-sama.
You smell good.
Indeed.
You two, please feel free to move onto the bed.
Okay!
Sink, you, too.
Okay!
Wait, I don't think that's okay.
Let's sleep together!
Come on, Sink.
If you say so...
Sink, come here!
Those two are already asleep.
They got up early today.
I'll turn off the lights.
So, Sink...
Yes?
Do you remember how I said
that I loved you when we parted last time?
Of course. I said the same thing.
It's kind of like a dream
that I'm holding the hand I let go of back then.
Though we do have to part again soon.
The next time I can come
will be after my exams in fall.
It'll be really soon.
Yes, I'll be waiting.
Tonight I want to hug you tightly
so I won't forget your smell and warmth.
Is that okay?
Of course, as much as you want.
Then hug!
So warm... and happy...
Now, Leo-sama, Nanami-san, it's morning!
Gau-sama and Genoise, get up, get up, get up!
Come on, get up, please!
Violet-san, you're sticking to the routine too much...
Can't you think of a more gentle way
to wake us on the day we have to part?
This has nothing to do with that.
After completing many tasks,
the Heroes will return to their homeland for now.
Biscotti's Hero, Sink,
and Pastillage's Hero, Rebecca,
shall have some time to recover.
Now, please return the divine swords to your summoners.
The return ritual is now finished.
Thank you!
Rebecca, I want you to have this.
It's my treasure; my mother gave it to me before she left.
So the other day, you went to go get this?
That's right.
I want you to have it...
and, if possible, wear it often.
But this is too precious...
The summoner and the Hero.
An article of promise to connect the two worlds.
For that, an item that both have deep ties to is best.
That's one of the requirements
of Rico's new summoning technique.
I'm sure that this will definitely create a path for us.
Then I'll keep it safe for you.
I'll make sure that I can return it
any time you want to wear it.
Thank you.
I love you, Cou-sama!
I love you, too, Rebecca!
Sink, I have this for you.
It's a Biscotti-made Earth clock.
Rico designed it,
and Eclair, Yukikaze, and I helped with the assembly.
Thank you. I will treasure this.
Okay!
This is from me.
The Galette army's MVP prize for the Union Fest.
Awesome! Thank you!
I'll probably be back here in no time!
So please wait for me, Leo-sama!
Yes, I'm counting on you, Hero Nanami.
All right, Princess, Cou-sama.
Bye you two!
See you soon!
Yes!
Earth/ Great Britain, City of London
Oh?
Mom...
When did you get back?
I would have come to pick you up, if you had called.
I'm home...
What? Are you still jet-lagged?
Make sure to put out your laundry and trash.
Okay.
Same Day - Earth/ Japan Kinokawa City, Tokino
Is this your room?
Yes?!
Hey, Sink.
Nanami? You got home safely?
Yeah, how about you?
We're fine, too.
Want to talk to Becky?
Yeah!
Yes. I'm fine, too.
Where did you go back to?
So our summer of adventures came to a close.
Our memories stayed with us,
and we have solid proof we were there, too.
It's nice to be home,
but since I slept with Cou-sama every night,
I can't settle down...
That's something every Hero has to deal with.
Hang in there!
I really understand how you felt at the beginning of spring now.
See!
Oh, did you write your letter?
Yes, I did.
We're doing our homework at the library tomorrow, right?
Will you look over it to make sure I
didn't mess up the Flonyard letters?
Roger that.
Sink, come eat.
Okay!
See you tomorrow.
Mom, this way!
Sink, sorry for the wait.
Hey...
Is something wrong?
No, it's just that I haven't
seen you outside with your hair down often.
I kind of did it so that it would work with Cou-sama's pendant.
I look a bit older, don't I?
I was surprised because you look quite a bit older.
Becky, you're really pretty!
Thanks.
That reminds me,
you saved me during the pendant episode, too.
We both did it. The two Heroes.
Since you're a Hero and totally look grown up,
I think calling you by your childhood name Becky might be rude.
I guess then it's Rebecca?
Well, I did think that I might like it
if you called me that...
Rebecca.
It's way more embarrassing than I imagined
to have you actually call me that!
Why does it feel so weird?!
Rebecca, it's just because you're not used to it.
Rebecca?
Stop. Stop, I can't!
Really?
I'm sorry. I'll be fine with Becky for now.
I'll change my hair back, too.
Well if you say so, Becky.
Sink, you're so nice, even though I'm being totally crazy.
No, no.
Thank you, Sink. I love you!
Yes! I love you, too!
Let's go!
Yeah!
The second summer vacation of middle school...
It was the second time for Sink, and the first time
for Nanami and myself to live the Hero experience.
The place where fun and hot days
and people we love are waiting for us...
We'll definitely be going back there again.
This summer was truly great, again.
Yes, and we'll be back together in no time, right?
Yes, so everybody...
See you soon!
See you soon!
