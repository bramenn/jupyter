Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Dammit! Where the heck has Ganju run off to?
Ikkaku said the one chasing Ganju was the 5th seat of Squad 11
His name was
It was Itwas Huh? Well, never mind.
That means hes the 5th strongest from the Captain on down.
I gotta rescue Ganju. He probably cant manage on his own.
Therere nothing but these same walls all over the place!
Im getting mad!
Hey! Ganju! Where the hell are you?!
If you can hear me, send up some fireworks to let me know!
You dimwit!
Rats! I gave myself away.
Theres one! The orange-haired Soul Reaper!
Youre not getting away!
Kill im!
For the glory of Zaraki Squad, even if it means death!
Hes getting away! After him!
Bastard! Stop!
Give up, orange head!
Your luck ran out when you met me!
This means a promotion!
Dammit! Ganju! Where are you?!
A hole?
A hole!
Dammit! Another hole?! How many are there, anyway?
Its the last hole.
For you, anyhow.
Whaddya mean, the last hole”?! Youll never convince me of that!
Im getting away from you. Even if I have to fall into a hole!
Would you like to try?
I didnt tell you, but
the bottom of the hole is surrounded by Sekki-Seki.
In other words, they completely block spiritual powers.
Now you know, dont you?
Why no one who falls in can ever get out again?
Ow!
I see the damage I inflicted is still there, after all
Well, youve managed to elude me all this time,
even though wounded.
I suppose I should commend you for coming so far,
as ugly as you are.
You really make me sick! Bastard!
I make you sick? That cant be helped.
Ugly ones envy the beautiful. Its only natural.
Hey, Ganju!
Halt! Filthy Ryoka!
Is that your comrade making all that racket?
Hes been calling your name all this time.
Halt, I say!
Bow to your fate!
Damn! They sure are persistent!
Ganju! Ganju!
Your friend behaves in the same ugly manner as you.
It will only summon a never-ending horde of Soul Reapers.
Really
Its difficult to understand his lack of good sense.
Aint you the one without good sense?
Huh?
Ichigo is there because he defeated your bald-headed partner.
T-That cant be!
Our Squad 11 is the best combat unit of the 13 Court Guard Squads!
Ikkaku is our 3rd best fighter! How could your man defeat him?!
Your only strong skill is seeing openings!
You aint seen nothing yet!
Shiba-Style Battle-Level Shooting Flower!
Senpen Banka!
Dont underestimate me! You call that a skill?!
How dare you?
My face, how dare you?!
Now you look more like a man!
No finesse.
You probably mean to use your one strange skill to collapse the ground,
and kill us both.
Huh! Me, die with you? Id never die so wastefully!
Silence!
Youre a tough bastard.
For all this time youve run from me, enduring my attacks,
and yet you still can move.
I marvel at your physical strength.
Just a while longer Just a little while longer
He still underestimates my power.
The only time to use the Seppa is now, while his guard is down!
Truly That alone is regrettable.
If you had been born beautiful
You would have been my very favorite...
I cant dodge him!
Whats wrong?
Cant you use that floating technique anymore?
Ugly
What good is it for an ugly one to persist in living?
If one is born ugly, he should at least die beautifully.
I disagree.
It seems our ideas of aesthetics are completely different.
I was taught that, ugly or not, the one who survives is the finest!
What?!
Bastard! You dare lay your ugly hand on my head!
It helped that you underestimated me to the last.
Now for the finish! Shiba-Style Rock-Wave Secret Move!
Renkan Seppa Sen!
W-What the?!
Dammit!
You cant finish me with this puny attack!
Dont make me laugh!
Where are you?! Where?!
H-Hey! Take this!
Whats this?
Its a bomb!
Noo!
What the heck. Hes over there?
Its a little late for that.
Shut up.
Hey, theyre close! But
its not this way, is it?
Since its a dead end.
Shouldnt we have turned right at the last corner?
Youre the one who said to come this way!
Oh, Kenny! You shouldnt blame others!
Wasnt I close? There, go there!
This way, right?
Yep!
Theyre gone, arent they?
Yes
He seemed terribly strong. Its lucky that he didnt see us, isnt it?
Yes. He must be the same type as Kurosaki.
He has awesome power, but poor detection abilities.
Now We changed sites, but where should we go from here?
How about that way?
I see a tower off in the distance
Tower? Where?
Look, over there.
Didnt touch her
To escape from such close range very good.
Magnificent!
If you had met anyone but me, you might have lived a little longer.
Lament! Ill count to ten to give you time to lament.
One
I sense the collision of Spirit Pressure here and there.
Dont die, my friends. Live!
One
Two
Ohthank you. Im all right, Ishida.
Three Four
Yesyou are.
Five
Hes not the same Ishida as a while ago.
Six
He moved so quickly.
Seven
For a split second, Ishida vanished from my consciousness
then I was saved before I realized.
Such a transformation at the mere sight of a Soul Reaper.
Its just as Yoruichi said. Ishida is a Quincy.
Even now, Soul Reapers are enemies to him.
Ten!
Now, your time for lamentation is over. Have you done it to your satisfaction?
Hes coming!
Right!
Now comes another time for lamentation.
Come, Soul Reaper! Im the one youll fight!
It is not you who decides who will fight!
Now, I shall end your lamentation. With your death
Ms. Inoue! Run!
No, I mustnt run. Ive got to fight and save Kurosaki!
Tsubaki!
At last, its show time. Aim well!
Koten Zanshun! I reject!
Tsubaki!
Fool Faltering like that!
Tsubaki
That was the first time I saw that technique.
Theres no intent to kill in your attack.
Though you might kill Hollows with that move,
it will have no effect on Soul Reapers.
M-My body wont move
This is a battleground!
Without the intent to kill, youll never stop anyone!
Wha-?!
So you want an attack with intent to kill?
Then fight me. Its here in my bow
The intent to kill you love so much.
Hanataro!
What do you want? This is no place for your kind!
Be gone! We never sent for anyone from Squad 4!
UhI used to do the cleaning when she was in Squad 6 barracks prison.
I thought the Shishinro might need some cleaning, too
The Shishinro cant be opened for anyone until the sentence is carried out!
Dont you even know that?!
Beat it, beat it!
Oh, but
Beat it, or Ill hack you to pieces!
Y-Yes, sir
Whats wrong?! Scared?
You cant get away, Ryoka!
Youll get us a special promotion!
Rats! I'm surrounded!
There's no way out!
Geez!
I let up a little, and it goes to their heads!
Anyhow, what should I do?
Men! Kill im!
Im g-getting crushed!
Cut it out, bastards!
So I can run!
Hes off again! Get im!
How many are there, anyway?!
HmmVery interesting. Would you be a Quincy?
Thats right.
Ishidas bow
Its totally different from the one I saw!
In its appearance and even in its spiritual pressure!
That glove
He must have been practicing in order to use it properly.
Learning to use it practicing all alone
This is interesting.
One uses an unfamiliar skill; the other is a Quincy.
And both employ projectile weapons.
And youve both come to fight me.
What coincidence! What a twist of fate.
Now I must show you. The true form of my Zanpaku-to.
Spread your wings! Tsunzaki Garasu!
What do you think? Now, lament.
I am 4th Seat of Squad 7! Jirobo Ikkanzaka!
Also known as Jirobo Wind Sythe!
The nickname, Wind Sythe, proves that
I am the most skilled in projectile weapons.
My countless blades dance through space.
No one has seen my Tsunzaki Garasu and lived!
Here, here. How do you like it?
You cant even follow them with your eyes, can you?
Theyre the prelude to a brilliant death.
Before Tsunzaki Garasu,
your bow and arrows are as helpless as a baby!
As a fellow master of flying weapons, youll fully regret having met me
Huh?!
How interesting. Unlike the outside world
here, the strongest fighter seems to be the most long-winded whiner.
Ridiculous! That was a fluke!
Dont be so cocky.
You still dont understand?
Sorry, but if youre supposed to be the strongest,
I take back your nickname as of today.
Where flying weapons are concerned, I seem to be the better man.
The name, Uryu Weasel with Scythe,” though, doesnt sound all too cool.
You men search over there. If you find them, take them alive.
They might make interesting research specimens.
Dont let the other Squads capture them first.
Yes, sir!
Go!
Hmph! Theyre only humans, though.
I dont expect very good specimens.
Hell Butterfly? Whats the message, Nemu?
Yes, sir
Ikkaku Madarame of Squad 11 encountered and fought a Ryoka.
What?! So the Squad 11 already has a Ryoka?
No, Ikkaku was beaten by the Ryoka
and taken to the Squad 4 General Relief Station.
The Ryoka escaped and his whereabouts remain unknown.
Defeated by a Ryoka? My my
Among the Ryoka, there seem to be quite interesting subjects.
Wheres Zaraki?
Searching for Ryoka, sir.
Then he wouldnt know about this yet.
Well, before he gets wind of it, lets get the info on Ryoka.
Lord Mayuri, where are you going?
To see Ikkaku. How slow you are to guess.
Come along, dullard.
I sense Zarakis Spiritual Pressure.
So hes on the move
Ichigo Be careful!
Get him!
There!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll alway stay close to you
Now and forever
We're surrounded! So many Soul Reapers!
We've got to fnd someplace to hide!
We need a plan to outwit the enemy!
Just blast them with an attack right through the middle!
Okay, you go.
You go.
You go.
Go, Ganju!
Uh, I've got piano practice
