This world is filled with dungeons.
It is said that some of them even have perilous labyrinths that thwart adventurers.
Undiscovered.
Untrodden.
Unreachable.
People called these places rich in mystery...
hidden dungeons!
Come forth, brave one.
I await you on the second floor.
This way.
This way.
I, Noir Stardia, am the third son of a noble.
After graduating from the Jastal Preparatory School,
I decided to pursue a career instead of higher education.
Today was supposed to be my first day on the job, but...
Father? Mother? What's wrong?
Well, that library you're supposed to work at...
Yes, today's my first day.
Actually, the viscount's son interfered,
and you won't be able to work there after all.
Huh?
Aristocratic Society
We may be nobles, but the Stardia family only held a baronetcy.
Baronet
Viscount
Baron
Earl
Marquess
Duke
Librarian
Baron
Baron
Viscount
Earl
Viscount
We're just poor nobles who stand no chance against anyone ranked higher.
Father, please raise your head.
I absolutely deplore you... I mean, adore you, Father.
You totally meant the first part!
But I guess the real question is... what do I do now?
You shitty father... I mean, Father.
You didn't even hesitate that time! I felt that malice!
I feel your anger, my son!
I will not accept this!
Who is this fiend who took my dearest brother's position?
I will go talk to them personally!
Alice, I appreciate it, but we're talking about the son of a viscount.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
But... that's simply not fair, my dear brother!
I know! Why not take the exam for the Hero Academy?
The Hero Academy, eh?
Those who graduate from the Hero Academy can become monster hunters or royal knights.
Basically, you're set for life if you make it there.
I'd never pass.
You should at least try!
If you don't make it, I'll take care of you myself!
Th-Thanks...
Noir!
Hey!
Morning!
Morning, Emma.
This is Emma Brightness.
She was born into a barony, meaning her family is wealthy,
but our parents are friends,
and she's been my friend since we were kids.
We're both going to be librarians starting today!
Let us do our best!
Actually, about that, Emma...
What?!
Th-Th-Then... you can't be a librarian?
No...
But...
Y-You're that disappointed?
Well, I mean...
I had some really good news!
About your skill.
Skill? You mean my Great Sage skill?
Skill
The Great Sage skill is my one and only skill.
Tells the user everything about the world (even the unexplained).
It tells me everything about the world.
It's a pretty rare skill.
My parents jumped for joy when they had my skill appraised at the church.
Fantastic, my son!
Oh, how wonderful!
But...
I can't use the Great Sage skill.
Q: What's tomorrow's hhhhweather forecast?
Well, actually, I can...
A: It'll be sunny!
But every time I use it,
I'm plagued with a headache so bad that I wish for death.
Which is why I don't use it.
I just happened to be going through the ancient texts yesterday,
and I found this passage...
Whenever the great sage of old, Marlin, was plagued with terrible headaches,
he demanded kisses from his wives.
Why, though?
They must've been effective against his headaches! Duh!
What?
Th-That makes sense, doesn't it?
Actually, you might have a point.
D-Do you want to give it a try?
Are you sure?
W-W-Well, who else are you going to try that with?!
It's just a kiss! And we've known each other forever...
And we're totally adults!
In that case...
Huh?!
W-Wait.
Let's find a better spot...
Y-You can go ahead.
I hope you're ready.
You can do it!
Answer my query, Great Sage.
As you wish.
I want to become stronger so I can pass the exam for the Hero Academy.
What's the most efficient way to become stronger?
Explore a hidden dungeon.
A hidden dungeon? Where's the closest one?
There lies a cave 15,000 meters southwest of here.
Activate the switch in the wall, and you will find the Infinite Labyrin
My head's killing me!
Should we kiss again?
Yes, please!
My headache's fading...
Does... your head still hurt?
Yeah.
I've got all the right gear.
I even borrowed a sword from Father.
Is this where the switch is?
You will need a spell to open the door.
And that spell is...
Hidden dungeon only I can enter!
Let me train in secret to become the strongest in the world!
This way.
U-Um... You are alive, right?
Touch my head.
I am Olivia Servant!
I am Olivia Servant a totally super-awesome adventurer
A totally super-awesome adventurer!
You see, I happened to stumble upon this hidden dungeon on one of my walks.
I figured out how to get in all by myself.
I ran into a monster on the second floor and decimated it in two seconds.
Things were going peachy,
but then a trap activated.
I've been tied up in here for 200 years since then.
For 200 years?! I'll undo your restraints right
Nope, hold it. These are special chains called Death Chains.
Cut them and say bye-bye to Olivia.
Huh? Then why did you call me here?
I've been looking for someone to talk to.
I figured no one would ever hear me, but you actually showed up!
You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this moment!
Anyway, you must have real potential, considering you found this dungeon.
What's your name?
It's Noir Stardia.
Noir, eh?
So what brought you here, anyway?
Well...
Right. I got you.
But I'm sure the Great Sage also said this!
The super-hot babe Olivia is sealed away in B2!
Nope. He didn't say a word about you.
Well, whatever. So you wanna get stronger, right?
Then you can have my skills.
Huh?
Well, I'm not going anywhere anytime soon...
So just tap your forehead against mine.
L-Like this?
Dun dun da-dun!
You've quite literally got skills, Noir. Mine, that is.
Now I can die without any regrets.
Wait! You can't just die now!
Pfft. Like I'd actually die.
You can address me as Master from now on.
Now, I'll give you a simple rundown of my skills.
The Get Creative skill.
You can create pretty much any skill your mind can think of.
The Bestow skill.
You can give the skills you've created to other people or objects.
Noir
Wings
The Editor skill.
Noir
Wings
You can edit the skills you've given to yourself or others.
So... Get Creative, Bestow, and Editor.
Skills
Get Creative
Bestow
Editor
Depending on how I use these, I can create insanely powerful attacks.
But be careful.
To use any of these skills, you need life points, or LP.
Life Points
The stronger the skill, the more LP it consumes,
Slow
Fast
so make sure you use LP Conversion when that happens.
LP Conversion
LP Conversion?
If you do something that feels good, your satisfaction gets turned into LP.
Huh?
For example, fulfilling your sexual desires.
Getting close with a charming person of the opposite sex.
Then there's hunger.
Eating delicious foods and savoring delicacies are both effective.
Finally, the desire for worldly things.
Earn that dough and spend it like there's no tomorrow.
S-So you're telling me to be a hedonist.
Oh, FYI, if your LP reaches zero, you die.
Maybe tell me that first.
How much LP do you have right now?
Concentrate.
S-Sure.
Five hundred fifty.
Five hundred fifty, eh? Why don't you give Get Creative a shot?
All right. Here I go.
Jiggle.
Jiggle.
Get Creative: Stone Bullet skill.
Skill
Stone Bullet
Noir Stardia LP. 550
Skills Skill h Skill h
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
Stone Bullet visualizes condensing dust in the air in front of my hand...
and fires it!
I-I beat it...
But I'm kinda tired now.
I'm going to have to figure out how to rake in that LP from now on.
But for today...
Oh, Big Brother!
Is my lap a comferble... a comfortable pillow for you?
Man, I feel alive again.
Can I get a goodnight hug, too?
Huh?!
I'm so blessed to have such a cute, kind little sister!
Noir Stardia
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Noir.
S-Sorry to call you out of the blue.
No, it's fine. What did you want to talk about?
I have a favor to ask.
Also, you seem a bit different today.
Y-You think so?
You're usually more reserved.
Well, everyone's always staring at my chest!
Of course I'd want to hide it.
I'm not sure if that outfit is helping...
Well, that's because today's supposed to be special!
Noir, you doofus.
Sorry! I was just worried.
I've known you forever, and you're important to me.
Just saying that I'm important to you isn't enough!
Th-Then... can I hug you?
Sure...
Okay... here I go.
Your scent is so calming.
Not to mention...
Noir Stardia
A few hours prior
So, Olivia...
You hear somethin'?
M-Master...
Yes?
I was hoping I could make a skill that would help me
with the Hero Academy exam.
This calls for cheating!
You're awful, you know that?
And you're too much of a goody two shoes.
That's exactly why they took your job.
It takes 300 LP to use, but I've got just the skill for you.
You interested?
Yes, please!
In that case...
Discerning Eye
Have a peek into information about any living creature or object.
The Discerning Eye!
With this, you're good to go on your exam!
Thanks, Emma.
It's fine. This is basically a greeting.
Okay, now to Get Creative and create the Discerning Eye skill.
Noir Stardia LP. 950

Let's try it out.
Emma Brightness Lv. 17
Species Occupation Skills
I see it!
This means I'll pass for sure!
I need to make sure I thank Emma properly.
Man, my shoulders are so stiff.
My chest is way too heavy.
All right!
Skill
Small Boobs
I'll use Get Creative and give Emma Small Boobs.
I'll need a total of 80 LP to do this, but...
Needed to Get Creative LP. 30 Needed to Bestow to Emma LP. 50
There!
Wh-What just happened?!
Wh-What? Why?!
Now your shoulders won't be so stiff.
Don't worry, plenty of people love small boobs. Isn't that great?
Are you being serious right now?
Yup!
Though I definitely prefer them big.
Gimme back my boobs, you doofus!
I ended up having to use Editor to give her boobs back.
Talk about a waste of LP.
Hero Academy The Day of the Exam
Feeling confident?
But of course.
Barons and viscounts...
They're totally different from a baronet like me.
We will now begin the entrance exam.
Your task is to collect raw materials from monsters.
You'll be judged on how much you bring in and how rare the materials are.
This will be a team effort in which you split up into groups of three.
Return empty-handed, and you fail!
That is all!
We have to make a team?
No one told us that before.
I'd better hurry up and find people.
E-Excuse me. Would you like to...
Hm? You reek of baronet stench.
Um...
Yeah, I don't associate with trash.
Trash, huh?
Hey, wanna team up?
Heya, Noir!
E-Emma? What are you doing here?
What about your librarian job?
I quit. I figured I'd give the Hero Academy a shot, too.
I-I can't believe you quit that easily...
Well, I didn't get to be with you.
Huh?
Noir, you doofus. Come on, let's team up.
Hey, want to team up?
I'm Lenore Bludon.
You don't need to be formal with me. The more casual, the better.
I'm Emma Brightness, my la... Lenore.
Brightness? Ah, a barony.
I'm Noir Stardia.
I didn't ask for your name.
Why would I bother remembering the name of a baronet?
Huh?
Now, then...
Gather as many materials as you can by noon tomorrow.
You can obtain them in any way you'd like.
Begin!
The marketplace!
I'm buying everything!
Y-You can buy the materials, too?
I guess so. He never said you had to actually defeat any monsters, so...
Let's split up.
Don't drag us down, Mr. Bottom of the Aristocratic Food Chain.
I guess the rich definitely have the upper hand.
Yeah...
What are you going to do, Noir?
If you're going to hunt for your materials, I'll come with you.
No, you wait here, Emma.
I have an idea.
I was sure there'd be plenty of rare monsters in a hidden dungeon.
And that's why I came to the third floor, but...
Are you serious right now?!
I'm still level 23...
Dead Reaper Lv. 99
Skill Skill Any damage dealt to its enemy with the Skill Scythe means Instant Death. Effect cannot Skill be avoided without specific resistance.
Not to mention, if that Scythe hits me, it's an insta-death for me.
I-If I use my Editor skill and delete its Instant Death attack...
Skill
LP needed to delete: 4000
Nope! I'd literally die eight times!
Noir Stardia
I created the skill Heavy and Bestowed it on the Reaper.
I managed to stop it for now,
but that instantly cost me 200 LP...
I feel so weak...
I lost so much LP, I can actually feel my life draining away...
But... I have to do this...
There's no other way!
I'll use 100 LP and my Editor skill to make the Stone Bullet size 100 centimeters!
Noir Stardia
Stone Bullet
You know, you seem a bit thin. Have you been eating properly?
Here. This should fill you up!
Stone Bullet 100!
Noir Stardia
I-I'm exhausted...
And now I will announce the top three teams from the entrance exam results.
He hasn't called our team at all.
Y-Yeah...
In third place, Team Genos with 5,890 points.
In second place, Team Elizabeth with 11,550 points.
H-He still hasn't called us.
Maybe we didn't even rank...
W-We should be okay.
I mean, Master said...
It wouldn't be weird if I brought this to the exam, right?
Nah.
It's better than bringing a golden slime, which doesn't exist on this continent.
They're grunts anyway, so you'll be fine.
B-But... if he doesn't call us...
And in first place...
Team Lenore with 128,000 points!
O-One hundred and twenty...
They had the skull of the extremely diabolical Dead Reaper among their materials.
This means they pass and rewrite history with that score.
Wh-What were you saying about this being a grunt, Master?
Whoops, my bad.
A Dead Reaper is nothing to me,
but I guess a student hunting them would be a miracle.
Well, whatever.
And so, I safely passed the exam for the Hero Academy.
My family was ecstatic, and this brightened everyone's moods.
That is, until we saw the enrollment fee.
Three hundred thousand rels?
How am I supposed to get that kind of money?
Next time, The Guild and the Receptionist.
