Metamorphie Vocias!
Metamorphie Vocias.
Metamorphie Vocias!
With this, I can mark that everyone has mastered metamorphosis magic...
Kagari has yet to give it a go.
Kagari has yet to go.
Oh... You're right!
You're right.
Metamorphie Vocias!
You are to master it today!
His son will be accompanying him too.
Yes, Master Andrew is renowned as the young noble of Appleton.
Not only is he a prodigy, but he's quite handsome as well.
You will not go! You are to stay in your room until you master basic metamorphosis magic.
You are forbidden! Stay in your room until you master basic metamorphosis magic.
Am I clear?
Count Hanbridge is our country's Minister of State.
Take all precautions not to offend him.
They are here!
Whoa, this marinated dogma mushroom is the best.
Begin by firmly evoking an image of the desired outcome.
An image, an image...
Metamorphie Vocias!
How are you enjoying this, Mister Hanbridge?
Is it not the most entrancing dance you have ever seen?
In particular, I've got my eye on Lady Diana from the distinguished Cavendish family.
Her beauty seems to emanate and overshadow the rest!
Is she really that famous?
Come on, man. I know you don't care about magic, but even you should've heard of Lady Diana.
Come on, man. I know how apathetic you are about magic, but you've gotta know Lady Diana.
Please enjoy the feast we have prepared after the show. Our cooks have made seadragon steak for you.
Give Master Andrew a tour of the academy.
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. My name is Diana.
Metamorphie Vocias!
Metamorphie Vocias!
At that time, I did get my hopes up a little.
I thought that I really was a great witch, but my powers were just dormant inside me.
Couldn't someone come and tell me whether I have talent or not already?
Those who seek the Fountain must reach the end of the north school building.
There you will find the Big Dipper Arch.
It's usually off-limits, but the security should be weak because of the party.
We were merely exchanging pleasantries at our summer residences as children.
We simply spoke occasionally at our summer villas as children.
As I recall, you were preoccupied by some strange magic throughout the season.
The others found it repulsive and stayed far away.
Perhaps you were too busy being swarmed by girls that you were unable to notice.
I didn't have the slightest interest in things that belong in the last century like magic.
Come to think of it, I believe we have had this futile conversation many times in the past.
Really, Frank? There is no value in things that have been rendered obsolete.
It's only natural that Luna Nova's financial situation has worsened.
You're as drastic as ever, Andrew.
There's no need to be so extreme in your beliefs.
I might have hit too close to home, perhaps.
Oh please. I couldn't care less about magic.
Metamorphie Vocias!
It would be troublesome if he were to be wandering around on his own.
It's an issue to have him wandering around on his own.
I'll get in a lot of trouble if someone finds me.
At this point we have no choice but to find the Fountain of Polaris.
I'll have the Fountain of Polaris bestow me with the great magic power of the stars.
Waken not the sleeping Arkas.
As the protector of Polaris, Arkas will attack all those who approach the Fountain.
We should probably avoid carelessly entering.
Honestly, you've got a fantastic school here!
Andrew, come quickly!
Preiss Capalm!
It's nice to see you again, Arkas.
I apologize for interrupting, but could I ask you to move aside?
If you would be so kind, please keep this in your confidence.
I promise.
I'll keep tonight's happenings a secret between us.
In that case, why did you put on such a performance for the magic conservatives?
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Metamorphie Faciesse.
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Incredible as always!
You're amazing!
Very good. I admit I am impressed.
With this, I can mark down that all of you have mastered metamorphosis magic...
Professor Badcock.
Kagari has yet to give it a try.
Oh, you're right.
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Akko! Akko!
No way!
What are these?!
How could you possibly not be able to cast first-level basic metamorphosis magic yet?
Why did this happen?!
You are to master it today!
Today? But isn't there supposed to be a party tonight?
Yes, there is.
And he will be accompanied by his son, won't he?
Yes, Lord Andrew, also known as The Viscount of Appleton.
And he is not only a prodigy, but quite handsome as well.
What? Handsome?
Miss Kagari!
I will not allow it! You are to stay in your room until you master basic metamorphosis magic.
Am I understood?
No...

They will be arriving shortly.
The Earl of Hanbridge is our country's Minister of State.
Take utmost care not to offend him.
It's almost time!
I wonder if he's as handsome as the rumors say.
Girls, a proper lady must practice restraint.
H-Headmistress!
Th-They are here!
Wow!
Whoa, this marinated doguma mushroom is the best.
I feel so bad for Akko having to miss this delicious banquet.
Did something happen to Miss Kagari?
Professor Ursula.
Professor Badcock told Akko...
To stay in her room and practice metamorphosis magic.
Miss Kagari is practicing by herself?
I can only hope for the best...
Okay, what did it say again?
Begin by strongly visualizing the desired outcome.
Visualize, visualize...
You're a rabbit.
You're going to be a rabbit.
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Come on!
That's not what I wanted!
How are you enjoying this, Lord Hanbridge?
Is it not a most entrancing dance?
Yes, it is quite charming, Headmistress Holbrooke.
Didn't I tell you little witches were great?
Actually, there's one that caught my eye. It's Lady Diana from the distinguished House of Cavendish.
The beauty emanating from her is overshadowing the rest!
She's that famous?
Come on, man. I know you don't care about magic, but even you must've heard of Lady Diana.
Please join us for the feast after the show. Our cooks have prepared seadragon steak for you.
Headmistress Holbrooke.
Yes?
Andrew appears to have tired of the dance.
Would you mind giving him a tour of the campus?
Diana!
You called?
Give Lord Andrew a tour of the academy.
Understood.
Nice to meet you! I'm Frank, one of Andrew's friends.
The pleasure is all mine. My name is Diana.
It's been a while.
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Guess it's not gonna work.
I'm losing my confidence.
Maybe I really am a dunce.
I did get my hopes up a little back then.
I thought that I really was a great witch and my powers were just sleeping inside me.
Can't someone just come and tell me whether I have talent or not already?
Found it!
The Fountain of Polaris.

The witch with hidden radiance.
If I'm the witch with hidden radiance...
The Fountain of Polaris is located at Luna Nova.
Those who seek the Fountain must go beyond the north school building.
There, they will find the Big Dipper Arch.
The north school building...
It's usually off-limits, but security should be weak because of the party.
Talk about a surprise.
I never expected the two of you to have been childhood friends.
We merely exchanged pleasantries at our summer residences as children.
I have no recollection of being treated as a friend.
As I recall, you were preoccupied by some strange magic all through the summer.
The other children thought it was creepy and kept their distance.
Oh, but it was quite popular.
Perhaps you were too preoccupied with the many girls flocking to you to notice.
You're right that I didn't notice.
I didn't have the slightest interest in things that belong in the last century, such as magic.
Come to think of it, I believe we have had this futile conversation a number of times in the past.
I think it's wonderful to have an interest in antiques.
Why would it be, Frank? There's no value in things that have been rendered obsolete.
It's only natural that Luna Nova's finances have deteriorated.
Unneeded things should quietly resign themselves to vanish.
You sure don't mince your words, Andrew!
But wouldn't it be fine to be a bit less staunch in your beliefs?
It is forbidden to proceed any further in this direction. Please follow me this way.
You went way too far! That was rude!
Perhaps I struck too hard at the heart of the matter.
You're unbelievable.
What do you think you're doing?
My apologies.
How about sounding like you mean it?
U-Um...
Uh, well...
Huh?
What was that for?!
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.
Are those ears real?
Of course they're not real!
Though I guess they are my ears.
Which is it?
They're my ears!
I just made them kind of rabbit-like with magic.
Oh, magic.
Please allow me to excuse myself, Miss...
I'm Akko! It's Miss Akko! Kagari Atsuko.
I mean, Atsuko Kagari?
Please call me Akko!
Have a pleasant evening, Miss Kagari.
H-Have a pleasant evening.
Um...
Andrew Hanbridge.
Have a good evening, Andrew...
Andrew?
You're the handsome man, Andrew?!
Are you a student here?
That's right.
I've always considered witches to be strange, but you're the most unique one I've ever met.
Really? Does that mean you like magic too?
Isn't that why you came to visit Luna Nova?
Oh, please. I couldn't care less about magic.
I'm unable to fathom why you insist on learning the antiquated and worthless use of magic.
Besides, it'll soon be gone forever.
It won't go away!
Magic won't go away. We won't lose it either!
Magic is neither antiquated nor is it worthless!
Magic is a really, really, really wonderful thing!
You say that magic still has worth?
Of course!
Care to give an example?
A-An example...
Metamorphie Vocias!
And how exactly does this provide value?
I-It was just a little mistake! I'll make it normal again!
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Don't tell me that you don't know how to fix it.
Andrew! What are you doing?
Oh no!
Where did he go?
It would be troublesome if he were to wander about on his own.
I'll really get an earful if someone finds me.
If possible, I'd rather not be seen like this either.
At this point, we have no choice but to find the Fountain of Polaris.
I'll have the Fountain of Polaris bestow the great magic power of the stars on me.
Then we should both be able to return to normal!

Miss Kagari, are you holding up okay by yourself?
I wouldn't mind helping
This is...
It should be beyond the north school building.
The Fountain of Polaris.
This might be it!
Find it?
Is this French?
I can't understand a word.
This is Latin.
Waken not the sleeping Arcas.
As the protector of Polaris, Arcas will attack all those who approach the Fountain.
We should probably avoid carelessly entering
Ouch...
Run away!
I didn't expect that thing to be inside!
Honestly, you've got a fantastic school here!
Look!
Hurry!
Andrew, hurry!
Andrew!
It's not on purpose! I swear it's not on purpose!
I know that.
I bet you think I'm doing it on purpose!
I am not.
Liar! You definitely are!
Paleis Capama!
It's nice to see you again, Arcas.
Wh-What happened?
Oh no, the Shiny Rod!
I sincerely apologize for interrupting, but could I ask you to move aside?
I'm finding it slightly difficult to breathe.
The Big Dipper Arch!
Hey!
The Fountain of Polaris...
I beg of you, bestow unto me the great magic power of the stars... please.
Chariot?!
It disappeared...
The Fountain of Polaris bestows the great magic power of the stars unto the witch with hidden radiance.
However, when visited by an immature witch, yet unworthy to wield its powers,
it vanishes from before her eyes.
It seems your visit was still a bit premature.
Yes.
I had my hopes up.
I thought that if I could find the Fountain of Polaris, I would be acknowledged as a witch with hidden radiance.
But it's not something anyone can acknowledge you for.
It's something you have to work hard for yourself, isn't it.
That's right.
Deep down inside,
you understood that from the start.
I want to be like her...
One day, I want to be like Chariot!
Here.
Come back here in the future.
At a time when you've grown far beyond where you are today.
I will!
Excuse me...
Please allow me to remove the magic cast on you.
And if you would be so kind, please keep this in your confidence.
I understand.
I'll keep what happened tonight a secret between us.
Good grief, today was a waste of a day.
It only served to confirm my convictions that witches have no purpose in this era.
Then why did you put on such a performance for those magic traditionalists?
It is important to place enemies in your debt.
You'll learn that soon enough.
