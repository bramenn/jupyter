Oh, so this is the beach in this world!
With all these people here,
it's tempting to just mow them all down at once, isn't it, Miss Kobayashi?
Don't do it.
The ocean here's salty?
It is.
That's the same, then.
The best thing about swimsuits is that you can boldly show off more flesh.
No, that's out.
Really?
What do you think, Shouta?
I-I don't where to look...
This is reassuring.
That doesn't make me happy to hear at all.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Yes?
Could you come with me? Your swimsuit is too skimpy.
Huh? Um, hey!
Well, that's to be expected.
I'm finally back.
You brought a spare swimsuit?
It's my scales.
Oh, that works for your swimsuits, too?
Yes, we looked them up on the internet!
Nice, aren't they?
I'm more envious of what's filling out that swimsuit though.
I want to play now.
Right, let's go play!
Miss Kobayashi, what will you do?
Hmm, nothing much.
What's the matter, Miss Kobayashi?
You haven't been very excited all day.
To be honest, I'm not a big fan of the beach.
Huh?!
That's too honest.
Well, it's hot, you get sunburned, and sand is annoying.
Same for me.
I prefer the indoors.
Then why did you come with us today?
Well...
Because I don't have much else to do this summer.
My manager asked me to look after Shouta-kun, too,
so I figured going with everyone would be better.
Oh, I know what's going on here!
That tsundere thing, right?!
Completely different.
I want to play now.
Oh, right.
Then, uh...
First, let's put on sunscreen!
What an inferior species,
having skin that gets damaged if you don't coat yourselves in such a thing.
Now, here I go, Miss Kobayashi!
Do anything weird and you're fired.
Yes.
Well, Shouta, could you?
There. Go ahead.
Come on.
I-I can't!
I see.
Switch, then.
Well, Shouta?
W-Well what?
Am I coating you right?
You really are a demon, aren't you?
Huh?!
Why are you trying to seduce me?!
Miss Lucoa, why don't you just try being a demon?
I want to play now.
Next is watermelon splitting.
I'm in.
Further right!
Ah, you went too far. A little left!
Yes, yes, now just go straight.
Okay, stop.
Yay.
Impressive, Kanna!
You obliterated every last trace of it.
Yeah, oh well.
I want to swim!
Sure, let's go!
Don't go too far out.
Why not?
It's dangerous.
Oh, you're right. He is scary, that Leviathan.
That one time I was nearly killed really was a disaster.
What did you do?
I saw him from behind and mistook him for Rahab when calling out to him.
Why you! I'll kill you!
Well, no, it's because no one can help you if you start to drown.
Oh yeah, you humans can't breathe under water, can you?
What an inferior species.
You can, Tohru?
I can. Swimming to my heart's content feels really good.
Does she have gills or something?
Lady Tohru, let's race to there.
You're on.
Miss Kobayashi, please give us the signal!
Sure.
On your marks,
ready,
go!
Ah, I forgot to tell them to hold back.
Not bad, Kanna.
Impressive, Lady Tohru.
First!
You went overboard.
I'm sorry.
Well, I guess it's time for lunch.
Okay!
Ocean
Beach Hut
Food Shaved Ice
Thanks for the meal!
What's next?
Well... Miss Kobayashi...?
What's wrong, Miss Kobayashi?
Nothing. I just noticed that old man hasn't changed much since back then.
Strawberry Melon Lemon Blue Hawaii
Back then?
Yeah. When I was still a kid, I came here with my family.
Family...
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Miss Kobayashi?
Hmm?
Could you tell me more about your family?
Huh?
Please?
Well...
I think it was a normal family.
I was raised normally.
They had me go to college.
After that, I left home to work.
Every now and then I talk to my parents on the phone to tell them how I'm doing.
Oh, I haven't seen them in a while.
That's a normal human family?
Probably.
Then why did Miss Kobayashi accept a dragon like me?
Why would someone born and raised normally...
Why?
Does that mean...
the humans of this world could accept dragons?
Kill them! Humans are evil! Kill them all!
What's wrong, Tohru?
Oh, it's nothing.
It's just, well...
I'm feeling listless.
Tohru.
Can I ride you?
This really is incredible.
It's been a while, so I'm excited!
Hup.
Tohru, aren't you homesick?
That's not the case.
But I feel like seeing my parents after what we just talked about.
Every now and then I would like to see my parents.
But it's all right.
Really?
Then what's bugging you?
I thought about introducing you to my parents.
You should.
I can't.
Why not?
Because I'm sure they'd kill you.
That sounds violent, but I guess that's common sense in your world, huh.
It is.
From my parent's point of view,
I'm definitely the weird one, not common sense.
It's sad.
Talking to Tohru about things like this is kind of heavy. And sad.
It drives home the difference between understanding words
and understanding each other.
It makes me realize we've lived in vastly different worlds.
But maybe that's all the more reason I want to cherish this time we have together.
I think that means you've become independent.
Independent?
Yeah. You've developed your own unique set of values.
You mean I've become an adult?
Who knows?
I'm not sure.
Most people don't try to become adults, they just can't stay children any longer.
Oh, you've hooked something, Miss Kobayashi.
Tiny.
Shall we head back?
Yes.
Dragon fireworks?
Yeah. I won them in a lottery at the shopping district.
That's it?
Yeah.
Huh?!
A real dragon is way better than that!
Impressive, Lady Tohru!
See, see! How's that, Miss Kobayashi?!
Shee, shee! How'f thah, Mih Chofahashi?!
I can't understand anything you're saying.
Episode 7
Summer's Staples! (The Fanservice Episode, Frankly)
What on Earth is this?!
The admission line for Comiket.
So we're supposed to provide cover for Takiya here?
Not cover. Help.
Apparently two of his sellers suddenly collapsed.
Leave it to me!
With my power, it will be easy to exterminate them all.
Don't.
By the way, was leaving Kanna behind a good idea?
There's a lot here that can't be shown to children.
Man, thanks, you two!
You're a lifesaver!
I owe you quite a bit anyway.
You didn't ask Mr. Fafnir?
Water Dragon Shrine
Bullet Hell Games
Oh, he's participating as a circle.
Curse Anthology
Huh?!
Participating as a circle?
A circle's a group of people like us, who sell things they made to other fans.
I see. So why did Mr. Fafnir do that?
I recommended all kinds of anime and games to him,
and at some point he started drawing his own.
He's totally enjoying this world, isn't he?
Well, Kobayashi-san, if you could handle sales,
and Tohru-chan, if you could manage the line please.
Sure thing.
Hmph. All right then.
As of this moment, the third day of Comic Market has begun.
Wh-What's this?
Please don't run.
Please don't run.
Everyone's just barely on the verge of running!
Desires
Something powerful is holding back their selfish impulses!
What in the world?!
Water Dragon Shrine
The new one, please.
That's 1,000 yen.
Water Dragon Shrine
Here, thank you very much.
The new one and the previous one, please.
Water Dragon Shrine WA-91 End of Line
The end of the line for Water Dragon Shrine starts here!
I'm sorry, please group closer together.
Hmm, for tens of thousands of individuals to be able take such
unified action without any prior exercises or training...
Something powerful must be influencing them.
Um, excuse me.
Yes?
Are you a cosplayer?
No, I'm not.
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.
I thought you were a cosplayer from abroad.
I'm a real maid!
Oh, I get it.
You're in character.
Wonderful.
No, I'm the real thing!
I understand your policy.
If you don't mind, could I please take your picture later?
I told you, I'm real!
The end of line starts here!
What incredible heat.
It feels like I'm in a fire drake's stomach.
Thank you very much!
I can't believe it's this bad.
Comiket is not to be underestimated.
Still,
what in the world could be attracting this many people and keeping them all in check?
I don't get it.
Tohru-chan!
Hey, thanks for your help.
Time to switch.
I've been waiting for this!
Summer Homework, Science Please select one of the following. 1) Sunflower Observation 2) Bug Collecting 3) Daily Weather 4) Electric Circuits Sunflower Observation: Observe the growth of a sunflower every day! Bug Collecting: Catch bugs near convenience stores, parks, or nearby plazas! Paste the bugs you've gathered!
Bug collecting...
Crunchy...
Grasshopper Moist
Butterfly Flaky
Cicada Crunchy
Where did you find it?
Let's Stick the Bugs We Found Here!
Uh, I think it's around this area...
What are you looking for?
Mr. Fafnir.
I figured I'd stop by since I'm on my break.
Say nothing.
I'll kill you.
You're the one who looks dead, Mr. Fafnir.
Well, that's what it's like for first-timers.
Can I have a look at your book?
Hmph, help yourself.
Curse Anthology
Curse Anthology.
Th-These are...
You've printed real, effective curses!
Even how to inflict them...
You could curse someone to death if you read this!
Hey, hey!
Only 1,000 yen?! That's cheap!
This is a bargain!
Wait, it's way too dangerous to be selling that to others!
Still, there are a lot of cosplayers here.
There are a lot of humans dressed up like the races from my world.
They're having fun pretending to be characters from anime and manga.
You're practically the same, too, Tohru.
I am a proper maid!
No matter how you look at me, I'm your loyal sex slave!
That's not a maid.
Hmm?
What is it?
The sahuagin, goblin, and witch over there...
Oh, I wonder what they're from.
They're real.
Huh?
Those three are real non-humans.
Huh?!
Excuse me!
You're from the other world, right?
Oh? You, too?
Yes. What are you doing here today?
I came to spread my wings.
I normally live disguised as a human,
but coming to events like this lets me enjoy time in my real form.
I see.
Why not take the chance to enjoy your real form, too?
Oh, that's impossible.
I'm a dragon.
A dragon?!
Yes.
That damn monster?!
Yes?
The one that could eat us all?!
Huh?!
Run!
Please don't run!
Dragons must be doing some crazy things.
They're wrong.
Oh?
When dragons get hungry, we only eat as much as necessary...
And in the end, this world is the survival of the fittest, so...
You're not denying it, just giving supplementary explanation?
You there!
Come with me!
Your outfit's out!
Huh? I, um...
Did you not read the participant guide?!
I guess Miss Lucoa came, too.
Wait...
She never learns.
Now that I look closer, there's a lot more.
Beings in their original form, that is.
That many?
Yes.
Those with great presence have left records of their stays in this world on different levels,
like Mr. Fafnir and Miss Lucoa.
Uh, umm...
I'd like to return to my real form...
for a little bit.
As long as you keep it where it won't cause trouble, you can.
Sorry for the wait!
Oh, can I take your picture?
Yes!
Excuse me, can I take one, too?
Huh?
Oh, me, too!
Huh?!
Excuse me, can I get your eyes over here please?
Over here, too, please!
Oh, it's almost time.
Over here, too, please!
Oh, well.
Hello. I came like I promised.
Oh, hello.
Hey, are you okay?
Well, to be honest, it's pretty rough.
But I can hang in there.
Um, it seems like everyone here is being drawn to this place by something powerful.
Do you have any idea what that is?
Well...
I think it's something that only exists in this place in this moment right now.
And I think everyone loves that.
I see.
I understand that very well.
Excuse me.
Could you take your picture soon?
Oh, right.
Geh, there's another line forming?
As of now, Comic Market 90 is over.
Thank you for participating, everyone.
We'll see you again in winter!
I'm back.
Good to see you. We managed fine without you during the second half.
I see. I'm sorry for ditching you.
It's fine.
We've Sold Out
Oh, Mr. Fafnir, how'd it go?
Poorly, it looks like.
So how was it? What'd you think of your first Comiket?
Well...
I reconfirmed my love for you, Miss Kobayashi.
Huh?
Kobayashi-dono! Tohru-dono!
You were a huge help today!
I'm truly grateful!
And I'd like to ask for your help as staff again this winter!
I'm done with this!
What will we print for our next thin book?
How about a dragon maid girl?
Nice!
Free studies?
My summer homework.
What should I do for it?
Well, I think you should study something that you find
mysterious or would like to know more about.
I see. Got it.
What are you doing?
Studying you.
Huh?
Next Episode
Kobayashi-san, there's a lot of talk about Tohru-chan on the internet.
I bet.
They mentioned you, too.
They said there was a sales lady with dead-fish eyes.
Sorry about that!
And they got turned on by those eyes.
Episode 8
New Dragon, Elma! (She's Finally Appearing, Huh?)
I just felt a chill.
