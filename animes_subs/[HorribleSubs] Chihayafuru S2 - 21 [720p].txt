Gust of wind...
Yes!
The sound of birds crossing...
What do I do?
I can hear everything.
I can hear the sound,
but my body, my left hand won't...
Chihaya Furu
Episode 21
But its legacy continues to spread
awakens the guards of Suma Gate at night
My life means nothing...
She's swinging at multiple cards?
In order to restore...
She hit seven cards there.
She counts as a man
Porky was right.
Strong swing!
She's powerful!
Calm down.
The match has just begun.
My reach and pivot point are completely different.
I feel bad about her injury,
but she thinks she'll win with her left hand?
That's absurd.
This is my chance
to avenge our loss yesterday!
My stance is towards the other side.
My center of gravity is on the other side.
I usually put my weight on my left knee,
but now it's on the right.
I can't think too much about it!
Use a natural stance.
After many, many years...
My hand will reach.
I just have to swing!
now bloom inside the nine-fold palace
For you, I head out to the fields...
Yes! Yes! Yes!
It won't work...
I've never practiced covering with my left hand...
Those girls are very similar. They're both easy to read.
while snow falls upon my sleeves
The hazed early dawn
A multi-syllable card on the opponent's side!
She covered!
mist over the Kawagiri River
Huh?
Wait, I touched it?
Who got it?!
Was Yuube-san faster?
You won that card!
Honest
I've never thought about how to use my left hand,
or how to approach the card with it.
How do left-handed players see a right-handed cover?
Yuube-san just lost The hazed early dawn mist on the outside,
but she has another multi-syllable card, My only thought as I,
at her lower right.
Right-handed players only know
how to play against other right-handed players.
But for a left-handed player...
My only thought as I am put out to sea is to ask the fishermen
It's open to take!
I lost two cards the same way...
Ayase-san's doing a wonderful job.
Is she actually left-handed?
She's winning multi-syllable cards she's struggled with.
I can do this.
I can do this!
I can come back.
So spring ends...
Attack to come back!
Huh?
Would the mountain cherry blossoms...
What?
When winds send waves...
I have no problem taking cards on the opponent's side.
So why
doesn't my body move when it's on my side?
What's going on?
It feels like riding a bike with the brakes held down halfway.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Their match is already over?!
How?!
There haven't been 25 cards read yet.
He won by 27 cards?!
He was perfect, plus he got his opponent to commit two faults?!
What the hell?
How does that even work?
May the scarlet kadsuras...
The Queen is next to finish.
She won by a perfect 25-0 score.
What about Chihaya?
What kind of karuta does Chihaya play?
How does Chihaya
play karuta now?
Huh?
Her right hand's injured?
She's using her left hand?!
Impassioned was your promise...
My own sleeves are like...
Why?
I can take cards on the opponent's side,
so why can't I take them from my own side?
If I were using my right hand, I could take these without thinking.
Why is a brake holding me back?
That's crazy, Chihaya.
Karuta isn't that simple.
Said bed was cold as I lay awake
You've gotten used to taking cards from your own side
without any thought.
Your cards are placed for a right-handed player.
I'm 10 cards up now.
She'll probably give up soon.
Most players would give up after injuring their right hand.
You worked hard to get here.
You put on a performance worthy of the captain of the team champions.
I should have just played with my right hand.
I would have been able to last one match at least.
No.
If I only get one match to use my right hand,
I should save it for Arata!
for the night would drag on when I thought of my beloved
In the sleepy spring sunlight,
She attacks the opponent's side quickly!
Um, excuse me.
Can I move my cards?
Uh, sure...
Sh-She moved all of them?
She flipped her cards around?
I've never seen this before.
I have to win until I play Arata!
Wait.
It's bad manners to move so many cards at one time.
Of course. I'm sorry.
It's fine. Leave them.
Huh?
Leave them in that order.
She's playing with the handicap of having to use her left hand.
Compared to that, shuffling her cards around is nothing.
She's so manly!
Thank you very much!
But I have no idea how this helps.
Redo my memorization...
If she's trying to confuse me, she'll end up hurting herself.
It's suicidal to mess around with your card positioning.
This is a gamble.
Don't think.
Do what I usually do,
only with my left hand.
a whirlwind of flower petals descends
Rain takes longer...
I did it! Just like normal!
Everything's normal, just flipped!
The storm blasts...
Note that though we may be...
Why is she suddenly so much faster?
Why?
I see.
Instead taking cards from this direction to that direction,
she's taking them from that direction to this direction.
It's less confusing if you just mirror your normal motions.
The flow has changed since she moved her cards.
This will be tough for her opponent.
Amazing, Ayase-san!
Please wait.
Excuse me.
I can't lose to her.
No matter who my opponent is.
The sky may hold the same moon
She sent Ayase-san's hand flying!
The headband girl recovered.
She has a powerful swing.
She goes for the card in front as well as the one that's read.
She even knocks away her opponent's hand at times.
That's playing rough!
Yuube-san didn't hit my hand away.
She passed through the opening I left her.
Amazing...
Don't panic. Stay calm.
This fall, I'll be aiming to become Queen with Megumu!
I can't win with weak attacks.
If I hesitate, I'll lose the card.
Focus.
Focus.
Chihaya...
She's playing hard with her left hand.
Having fun...
Now that I think about it,
Chihaya took her first card from me with her left hand.
Must be fun...
Playing karuta with Chihaya must be fun.
Thank you very much.
Shock
Yes, I eked out a win.
Ayase: won by 2 cards.
Okay.
Don't get the wrong idea!
I didn't lose to you!
I lost because my memorization wasn't good enough!
I'll work on my memorization by studying for college exams,
so I'll be back!
She even treats college exam prep as preparation for karuta!
Marvelous...
Chihaya.
That was incredible, Chihaya.
You won with your left hand.
That was incredible!
I believe that you have the talent for Karuta.
We will now announce the pairings for the second round.
Please check the chart and sit at your assigned position.
Hey, Ayase.
You survived the first round?
Yep, you too?
Oh, yeah!
I avenged Tsukuba!
Ayase, I feel like I can't lose today.
Nishida Yusei vs. Wataya Arata
Shock
Kaneko Natsumi vs. Ayase Chihaya
Kaneko-san from Akita.
I didn't get paired against Arata again.
Chihaya, see you later.
S-Sure.
Can I reach him?
Or is he still out of reach?
I want to know.
I'm not crazy about karuta the way Ayase is.
I prefer to avoid playing stronger players.
I'll take all the easy wins I can get.
But...
But...
I have to go back to being crazy about karuta.
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
When I'm up against you...
Komano-kun and Oe-san won their first round matches.
Tsukuba-kun won with a bye.
Hanano-san won?! Amazing!
Everyone's doing great!
to tell the people in the capital that I make for the islands
You're not supposed to make any sound when a card is being read.
May my sighs be blamed upon the moon,
They're so into the match.
These parents must care very much about their child.
Arata!
Mom, Dad...
If I win the high school tournament, I have a favor to ask.
I want you to let me attend a university in Tokyo.
Arata...
Most scholarship offers will come from private schools.
It would take 4,000,000 yen in the
first year to cover registration, tuition, and living expenses!
You're smart enough to attend a local public university!
Lose your match!
Lose your match!
May I see you never forget...
Hang in there, chubby kid!
I'm no longer the kid I used to be.
Yusei, you should work on game awareness instead of game sense.
With your mastery of the basics, you can do it.
Make assumptions about the places where cards will be read earlier.
I'll teach you how it works.
You'll learn how to take control of any match!
You rock, chubby kid!
Way to go!
Amazing...
He's following a methodology.
I can see his training in his playing style.
The presence of his coach in his play...
Chihaya's high school is really special.
They have different types of karuta players.
That's amazing.
When the misty bridge...
He's fast!
What was that?
So the flower petals are scattered...
He went from his own lower right to his own upper left.
Nothing can be worse...
He crossed again! Three different points this time!
Arata, why are you participating in the high school tournament this year?
Couldn't you wait until next year when you're a third-year?
Why this year?
If I get into a school early by recommendation, it'll be easier for me to focus.
On the Master Challenger tournament in the fall
and the Master match in the winter.
Why?
Why is he so much better than me?
I've played karuta since I was little.
I've practiced hard the whole time.
What's the difference?
Ayase...
If I injured my favored hand, I would forfeit.
It must have hurt when she was playing in the final yesterday,
but all she cared about was winning the team championship.
Desktomu-kun and Hanano worked hard to collect data on the other teams.
One win for Pizusawa!
Kana-chan secured a victory
right after my loss in the semifinal to ease the pressure.
I'm not doing this for attention!
But I'm here!
Tsukuba kept appealing to us for a chance to play.
Three wins.
We're getting three wins, guys.
Mashima never gave up.
That's why we were able to win.
What did I do?
I can at least...
I can at least refuse to give up!
Don't give up!
Don't give up!
Don't give up!
Thank you very much.
Are all the players at Mizusawa like this?
You played five matches yesterday,
yet you're still playing your heart out.
You bet.
I don't play anywhere as hard as the other members.
Mashima, Desktomu-kun, Kana-chan, Ayase, and the first-years
are all playing harder!
Damn...
Don't forget how he swung from his lower left to his upper right.
Damn! Damn!
Don't forget how he attacked from his opponent's upper left
to his opponent's lower right in a line.
This is why I hate strong players!
They make me want to beat them!
They make me want to work harder!
Ayase-san did it! She's through the second round!
Thank you very much.
Snore
This takes a lot more concentration than normal,
but I have to do this.
We will now announce the pairings for the third round.
I have to use my left hand
until I get to play Arata.
