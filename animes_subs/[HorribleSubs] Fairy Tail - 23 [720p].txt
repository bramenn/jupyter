Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
Our full-on conflict with Phantom Lord had begun!
But in the middle of it Lucy was captured, and the master lost his magical powers!
We're in trouble!
Although we managed to rescue Lucy somehow...
I love Fairy Tail!
That's right, we can do it!
Let's go for even more who-knows-what!!
The door to mystery is right in front of us
The whole world's a wonderland
which we're already wondering!!!
This excitement gets my heart racing
It's wonderful!
Who am I, I wonder?
What is real, I wonder?
Why can't I see tomorrow, I wonder?
The only part leveling up is my curiosity
We can't just throw away our daily life together, right?
Tell me! S. O. W.
Living itself will be our training!
So, we can make it!
Let's search for even more who-knows-what!
We can't be satisfied with just the normal answers
This magical wonder life
Our future is wondering!!!
We'll do our best living our life
the way we want to!
Let's wondering!!!
They said that an old friend of the master lives in a tree house in Magnolia East Forest.
A healing wizard named Poluchka, she hates humans, so she lives alone deep in the forest.
However they say she's a specialist in healing wounds from magic.
It seems the master has been carried there.
H-Hey!
What are you doing to the master, I mean, the sick person!
This happened because he was too reckless for his age.
Honestly, what a fool you are.
How long do you plan to stay here?!
Go home now!
Uh, but... with the master in this condition...
Please let us care for him!
Go home.
The stench of fretting faces is the greatest poison to a sick man.
This is from wind magic, isn't it?
This is the work of the magic, Drain.
A fearful magic that forces your opponent's magical power to flow out.
The drained magical power drifts off into the air and soon dissipates.
If we could gather Makarov's lost magical power,
that would speed his recovery, however...
It's already too late. His recovery will be prolonged...
Is that so?
I will inform everyone.
You're still here?
Wait, you didn't want us to stay and listen?
Go home this instant!
I hate the smell of humans!
Pardon us!
We're off!
You've always been such a handful...
For a wizard, their magical power is the source of life itself.
And for one with great magical power, the suffering increases in kind.
If you don't keep fighting, you may die like this.
You are such a fool...
15 Minutes!
Ah, damn it...
I can't believe we had to retreat!
This sucks!
And we didn't get revenge for the guild and Levy...
Damn it!
This is their headquarters.
If we attack them with ranged magic from the high ground to the southwest...
Next time I'll bring explosive lacrima with me!
Bring out a stack of powerful magic books for holder-type wizards from the warehouse!
What's the matter? Still uneasy?
No, it's not that.
It's just...
I'm sorry.
Well, it's the fate of rich heiress' to get chased.
And the ones who protect them are Men.
Don't say things like that!
But I'm really surprised. Why did you keep it a secret, Lucy?
I wasn't trying to hide anything.
After I ran away from home, I didn't really want to talk about it.
For a full year, he never showed any interest in his runaway daughter. And now he wants me back?
My father went to such terrible lengths to take me back...
He's the worst!
But when you get down to it, it's originally my fault for running away from home, right?
That's not true! Your father's the bad guy here!
You idiot!
I mean, Phantom!
Thanks to my selfish actions, I've caused all this trouble for everyone.
I'm really sorry.
I guess if I went home, it would end this, right?
I wonder about that.
But rich heiress just doesn't strike the right tone.
Laughing in this dirty old beer hall,
and making a ruckus while on some adventure... That's the Lucy I know.
You said you wanted to stay here, right?
What's the point of returning someplace you don't want to go?
You're Lucy of Fairy Tail!
This is your home to return to.
Don't cry, sheesh... You're stronger than that!
Oh, right! Men are weak to tears!
It's no use... I can't tell where Mystogan is.
I see. Too bad.
If their aim is Lucy, then they'll be attacking again.
We've got a lot of injured people... This doesn't look good.
Master is gravely wounded.
And we don't know where Mystogan is.
You're the only one we can rely on!
Laxus!
Please, come back!
Fairy Tail's in a crisis!
Serves the old codger right!
Doesn't have anything to do with me.
Handle it yourselves.
Laxus... Why, you...
After all...
The old man started this war. Why should I be the one to bail him out?
They're targeting Lucy... One of us!
Huh? Who's that?
Oh, you mean the newbie?
Tell her I'll be happy to save her if she becomes my woman.
I can't believe you!
Hey, now! Is that any way to speak to someone you're asking help from?
And tell the old man to hurry up and retire, so I can take over his position as master.
Mira...
I can't believe him...
Is that person actually a member of Fairy Tail?
In that case, I'll fight!
What are you saying?
Lucy was captured even though I was there!
No. You'll get in everyone's way as you are now.
Even if you once were an S class wizard.
The master is absent. No Laxus, Mystogan...
There are many injured.
Will it be impossible to continue the fight?
If I had gone with him...
The shame! This is my fault!
What's that?
Outside!
What the hell?
Their guild is walking!
Phantom?
W-What are we going to do?
I didn't predict this...
This is how they attack us?
The Magic Focusing Cannon, Jupiter...
Ready...
Eliminate them.
This is bad! Everyone, take cover!
Erza!
What do you plan to do?
She requipped?
H-Hey!
I won't let you touch the guild!
It's the Adamantine Armor!
She doesn't intend to actually block it, does she?!
I don't care how much crazy defensive power that armor gives you!
Don't do it, Erza! You'll die!
Get down!
Erza!
Natsu! All we can do is believe in her!
Erza!
W-Whoa...
She stopped it!
She saved our butts, as usual.
But...
Erza, hang in there!
Makarov.
And now Erza as well. Both are out of commission.
You no longer have a chance for victory.
Hand over Lucy Heartfilia.
Right now.
Not on your life!
Are we a guild that hands over our friends? I don't think so!
Lucy is one of us!
Hand her over.
We'd rather die than sell out our friends!
Our answer will never change, no matter what!
We will kick your ass!
Then you'll get a second extra-large helping of Jupiter!
Quiver in fear for the 15 minutes it takes to charge!
What?
Jupiter...
They're gonna shoot it again?
Erza!
Erza!
Damn it...
And Erza's magic was the only reason we survived the first shot...
Are their forces coming?
Weren't they supposed to fire Jupiter again?
Don't let your guard down!
Stare into the pits of hell, Fairy Tail!
You only have two choices left.
Be destroyed by my troops.
Or be blown away by Jupiter!
I can't believe this!
He plans on blowing up his own allies?
It's just a bluff! They won't shoot...
No, they're shooting.
That's Jose's magic, Shade.
They're not human.
They're phantom soldiers that Jose created.
What?! Shade...
You mean ghosts?
We have to do something about Jupiter.
I'll bust it to pieces!
15 minutes, right? Let me at it!
Happy!
Aye, sir!
Elfman, we're going in too!
All right!
We'll make a stand here!
Got it?
Yeah!
Lucy, this way!
We have a safe house. Stay there until the battle is over.
But...
I have to fight alongside everyone!
It's my fault this happened!
No, you're wrong, Lucy.
No one thinks that.
For our fallen comrades...
For our guild...
And to protect you!
Everyone takes pride in this battle.
So listen to what I say, okay?
Reedus, take Lucy to the safehouse!
Oui.
Please be careful!
Oui!
I might not have the power to fight now.
But I will protect my friends, no matter what.
14 minutes until Jupiter fires.
Natsu, please!
Take this!
What's this? My strength is being drained...
Wakaba!
Damn, these couldn't be...
Careful! They're cursed!
Exactly!
Phantom soldiers where just a touch will sap away your life!
That is Shade!
So just don't touch'em, right?
This is where we can shine!
Guns Magic!
Sunlight Shot!
Bisca, now!
Requip!
Good one there!
Nice shot!
What's this?
They came back to life?
Hey!
S-Seriously?
You've got to be kidding me.
There will be no end to this, will there?
What?
What is this terrible feeling I have...
Damn it! Not even a dent!
I guess we'll have to destroy it from the inside.
All right, let's go!
Aye!
W-What's that?
11 minutes until Jupiter fires.
It looks like a lacrima for concentrating magic.
I've never seen a lacrima that big before.
A Magic Focusing Cannon is a weapon that uses concentrated magic power instead of a cannon shell.
I don't really get it, but all I need to do is break it, right?
I won't let you do that.
A lookout?
Whatever! I'll just get rid of anyone in our way!
I won't let you.
I don't have time for this! Outta my way!
Natsu, what are you doing?
Uh, my body is... on its own...
It looks like... you're the one getting in your way.
10 minutes until Jupiter fires.
Thank you, Cana!
Don't let your guard down, Bisca.
We have to protect the guild at all costs!
Those guys don't understand the pain of losing your comrades, or the suffering having your guild destroyed!
We can't let people like that take our guild!
Only 9 minutes until Jupiter's next shot.
Move it. I'm going to smash that giant crystal!
If you can break that lacrima, Jupiter shouldn't be able to fire.
I won't let you.
Didn't I tell you?
7 minutes until Jupiter fires.
I don't have time to stand around blabbing at you!
Natsu!
Ow! Not again!
What the heck?
Natsu! We don't have time for you to fight this guy!
You've got to hurry and destroy Jupiter!
Why you little...
Natsu, listen to me!
6 minutes until Jupiter fires.
I am Totomaru, and I manipulate the element of fire.
One of those whatchamacalit-somethingorother 4?
Natsu, it's the Element 4! The only part you got right was the 4!
All flames are under my control.
Say, what?
Whether enemy or in nature, all flame is mine!
My flames are mine!
Natsu, who cares about that?
First, destroy this thing!
Seems you drew a bad match-up, my little fire wizard.
Jupiter is starting to activate!
5 minutes until Jupiter fires.
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
chasing after your profile left only in my revolving dreams
You said, I never want to see your face again, when you left me
But the tears on your cheek said it all
Every time you felt like you'd be swallowed up in the waves of contradiction
you always held back your tears, you know?
What a strong person, they said, but everyone overestimated you
and before you knew it you lost sight of who you really are
Then the sun I thought would always be near me collapsed
and the light shut off...
Rubbing out the truths and the lies of one day, altogether
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
still, ironically, chasing after your profile in my revolving dreams
Man, what a stupid reason to get into a fight!
If you're a man, then get some more passionate reason to fight me!
Natsu, you just sounded a lot like Elfman!
Oh, yeah?
Then...
If you're a Man...
Wait... That's even more like Elfman!
Next time: So No One Sees the Tears.
I can't get the way Elfman speaks out of my head!
Natsu, it must be love!
You can't be serious!
