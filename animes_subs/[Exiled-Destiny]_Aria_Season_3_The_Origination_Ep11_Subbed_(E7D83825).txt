Ah... I can't come up with anything good.
What's the matter? It's unusual to see you lost in thought.
Ah, well, I just...
Sounds like you're doing well.
Yes! I'm in super-motivated mode right now! Sounds like you're doing well.
Yes! I'm in super-motivated mode right now!
Super-motivated?
Princess Motivated?!
What's that? Princess Motivated?!
What's that?
Little Miss Princess...
Queen Selfish...
Little Princess Predictable...
Princess Not Allowed...
Crybaby Serenade...
In her case, it's not just about becoming a Prima.
This is quite difficult.
Hey, did you hear about Alice Carroll?
Ah, I did!
Two weeks ago, she was promoted to Prima even though she was a Pair, right?
No way! That's amazing!
She's the first one to ever do that!
And yet, Aika doesn't seem like she's fazed by it at all, does she?
Do you think her cheerfulness is just a front?
Well, Alice is the up-and-coming top Undine at our rival company, after all.
As Himeya's heir, I'm sure she's feeling a lot of pressure.
Do you remember that day Oboeteimasuka ano hi o
When your heart suddenly began to race Futo kanjita tokimeki o
The rays from the blue sky were pouring over you... Aoi hizashi abite
I couldn't look away, and when our eyes met Mitoreru to me ga atte
I couldn't help but smile Egao koboreta
It's just like a spiral Marude supiraare
As the days begin to swirl in brilliant colors Azayaka ni mawaridashita hibi
Always and forever, they're filled with love Itsumo itsudemo ai ga michiteita
Surely, it's a spiral Kitto supiraare
The days passed by, each one filled with warmth Atataka na mainichi o kasanetara
And before I knew it, off in the distance... Itsunomanika tooku ni
Those Ever-Changing Days...
Please take my hand.
Ah, thank you.
Please be careful.
There we go.
Of all the many water guide companies, thank you for choosing Himeya today.
It was a lot of fun.
Yeah. Gondolas are the best! It was a lot of fun.
Yeah. Gondolas are the best!
Thank you very much!
From the bottom of my heart, I hope that your vacation will be a memorable one.
I hope you become a Prima soon!
We'll be rooting for you.
Thank you very much! I'll do my best!
Both Himeya and I look forward to seeing you again during your next visit!
Now then...
Wha-?!
Is something wrong, Akira?
Ah, no...
By any chance, did I give them wrong information during the tour?
Ah, no...
Then, was I going over the speed limit somewhere?
Ah, no...
Aika!
Yes?! Aika!
Flap Flap Flap
Umm...
After this, all I have left today is a night cruise.
Yeah, that's right. And I'll be joining you as your assistant, remember?
All right.
I found a really good gelato shop the other day. Let's go there.
Huh? Okay...
Here's your limone.
Thank you!
It looks delicious!
Aren't you going to have one, Akira?
Huh? No, I'm fine.
But you're the one who asked me to come with you.
It's fine. Be thankful and just eat it.
Okay, snack time!
Yum!
It really is delicious.
You should have gotten one too, Akira.
You seem pretty cheerful.
Yes! I'm super-cheerful!
Oh, that's right!
You heard about it too, right?
About Junior skipping a rank and getting promoted to Prima.
I got to see the very moment it happened, together with Akari.
I was really lucky!
You were there, too?
Yes! In fact, we had front row seats.
One of her gloves was removed, and then off came her other glove.
I can't tell you how surprised I was! As expected of Alice!
Girl geniuses sure do things differently.
I've got a lot of catching up to do!
Aika...
To tomorrow and beyond! Let's go!
It's all right.
It's all right, Aika.
It's not all right!
Akira!
I, Aika S. Granzchesta of Himeya, am all fired up!
You know that feeling you get when someone's running just a bit ahead of you, pulling you along?
It's like that!
It's how you feel when you know you're running faster than usual.
This is my chance to excel further as an Undine, Akira!
I'm grateful to Junior...
So please train me hard, okay, Akira?
Right now, I'll be able to handle even the harshest criticisms!
I see.
Sorry about that.
Aika, do you have anything planned for next month's holiday?
I'm completely free that day, so I'm going shopping with Al.
I see.
All right, cancel it.
That's the only day I have off. You'll be spending the entire day with me.
T-That's too cruel...
What happened to that spirit you had a moment ago?
Here.
Little Princess Predictable.
What is this?
Queen Selfish.
Little Miss Princess.
Crybaby Serenade.
Rosen...
Is this?
Which one do you like?
I figured I should get your opinion, as well.
Akira...
I won't forgive you if you fail.
My future Queen.
Right!
But really, you shouldn't have crumpled up this paper.
Enough! Be quiet!
Everything is for the sake of my beloved Rosen Queen.
Orange Princess!
Orange Princess!
Orange Princess?
Orange Princess!
Alice Carroll!
Yes?
Please get used to being called by your alias.
Your customers are waiting for you.
I'm sorry!
Since I became a Prima, every day has been frantic.
The days go by like a hectic whirlwind.
If I have time to think, I just start to worry, so I suppose it's better this way.
Please take my hand.
Thank you.
This is the Bridge of Sighs.
It looks as though it's made of stone, but surprisingly, the inside is made of wood.
Oh.
Let's go see it later.
Yes, we should.
If you prefer, I can put in a tour reservation for you. Would you like me to do that?
Oh, that'd be helpful.
Could you do that for us, please?
I'd be happy to.
It's Akari and Aika.
They're practicing hard together.
Since the moon-gazing party, it's been...
Excuse me...
Yes?
What's the name of that island over there, Miss Undine?
That's San Giorgio Maggiore.
If you climb the bell tower there, you can see a sweeping view of the coastline.
In that case, why don't we go there after we visit the Bridge of Sighs?
Yes!
Until recently, we used to spend every day together, too.
I haven't been able to see them for quite a while now.
Good work.
Good work to you, too.
It's that late already?
It's always like this, lately.
I shouldn't go see them unannounced. I'll call first.
I'm sure it'd be a bother if I said I wanted to come visit this late at night.
Besides, I don't have a reason.
I don't have an excuse.
Athena, you're going to be late.
Eh? Ah, okay...
Off I go.
See you later.
Anything would be fine. Do I not have any?
Any excuse...
This building, which is currently being restored, was built in the seventeenth century.
It's the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute.
Marco Polo was a famous Venetian merchant and author, and this is a replica of his home.
Currently, it's open to the public as a memorial hall, so perhaps you'd like to visit if you're in the area?
The Palazzo Pisani Moretta is famous for its masquerade ball, and its beautiful Gothic interior.
Ah.
My.
Yummy!
Here we go!
Campanile! Campanile!
That was fun!
Yeah, it was fun! That was fun!
Yeah, it was fun!
Yeah, it was fun! I never knew gondola rides were so comfortable!
I never knew gondola rides were so comfortable!
Next time we come to Aqua, we'll be sure to ride with you again, Alice.
Thank you very much!
See you then.
Goodbye.
Bye-bye!
Thank you again.
It's for you!
Thank you.
Bye!
How'd it go?
What did she say?
She said, Thank you!
I see, that's great.
Yeah!
Hey, what should we do for dinner?
Hmm... What do you want to eat?
Umm...
Something yummy!
Oh! I wasn't expecting that!
Good work.
Thank you for the towel.
Sure, just leave it here when you come back.
Every day is hectic.
But there are a lot of fun things, too.
I have so many things I want to tell them.
All I want is to see them.
But it's so hard.
Will I ever be able to see them again?
Slap Slap Slap Slap
Slap Slap Slap Slap Slap-slap, slap-slap!
Slap Slap Slap Slap What a really ominous thing to say!
Slap Slap Slap Slap And after all those times Aika told me No negative thinking allowed!
Slap Slap Slap Slap Slap-slap.
Slap-slap.
Slap Slap...
I'm so lonely...
Yes?
I just got back.
No fading out allowed!
What are you doing here at this time of night?
What's with that tone of yours?
After we came all this way to see you, too.
You know that pizza shop we always go to?
This is their newest pizza!
I heard it's really delicious, so I thought we should all try it together.
Come on, let's eat while it's still hot.
Okay, let's eat!
Ah! I'm so hungry!
Me too!
You just ate all those bananas. You're really a glutton.
Wha-?!
The usual three...
The usual conversations...
The usual times...
The usual atmosphere...
Just a few moments ago, I was fretting about what I would do if I never saw them again, too.
That even if I want to see them, I don't have the time or an excuse to do so.
Just when I was thinking all that...
There you go again! You were worried about something like that? That's a bad habit, Junior.
Eh?! Was I thinking out loud?
Yeah, you were.
If you don't have the time, you just make it, like we're doing now.
But...
But... I don't have an excuse...
I haven't been able to do much of anything lately.
I don't have an excuse like this pizza to see you.
I don't have anything...
You do, though.
You're the excuse, Alice.
We don't need an excuse or a special reason to see you.
You're reason enough.
Hey! No sappy lines allowed!
Huh?
I'm going to do my best to catch up to you, Junior.
Me, too.
With these friends, I'll really be just fine!
A shore awash in golden waves Kin no nami kishibe ni
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning Akogare mezameru no asa ni
As my thoughts focus intently on someone, Dareka no koto o tsuyoku omou toki
Love rests on my palm, held high Kakageta te no hira ni ai ga tomaru
A future guided by the flow of water and wind Mizu no yukue to kaze ga shimesu mirai
I gaze at the hope that surrounds this world Kono hoshi o tsusumu kibou mitsumete
The distant clouds of light are beckoning now Tooi kumo hikari ga sasou you ni yureru ima
A shore awash in golden waves Kin no nami kishibe ni
Filled with yearning, I open my eyes and it's morning Akogare mezameru no asa ni
And my day begins Hajimaru
