They usually start to make offers early on.
He even said he went there just to meet us.
I see.
Don't tell Azuki anything, though.
I don't want to get her hopes up.
But it will become one, right?
Reversi's really popular after all.
Right?
Yeah.
If you make something good, it'll eventually get turned into an anime.
That's our philosophy.
That's right.
One day, Reversi will definitely...
Look at this, Saikou.
It's the person from yesterday, Katou's friend.

Kitami Ririka.
She's making her debut as a voice actress.
She's only had roles like Student A, though.
Really?!
Wait, you actually looked that up?
Well, I just couldn't calm down when I realized there was a company willing to make an anime of Reversi.
You can't get so worked up over something this small.
It's not like we've gotten an actual anime.
And if we do manage to get one, it'll be far in the future.
The only thing to do now is to concentrate on making our manga good.
Saikou.
Looks like this is the first time you can afford to take a break over New Year's.
Yeah.
I won't work from about the 30th until the 3rd.
That said, I'll probably end up working anyways since I'll have nothing else to do.
Wanna go on a vacation?
Huh?
Kaya and I are planning for our first vacation since our honeymoon.
Since your honeymoon? When you went to Kinugawa for three days and two nights?
I feel bad for Kaya.
It's been four and a half years since we went to that inn in Kinugawa, so we wanted to visit it again.
Kaya wants to invite you this time.
Wh-Why?! The two of you should go.
I'd just be in the way.
No, you wouldn't.
Since we're always working together, it'd feel weird not to have you around for that sort of thing.
I know how you feel.
Just think of it as a company trip.
Won't you come?
Ah, this is like heaven on Earth.
You sound like an old geezer, but I can't think of anything more fitting.
You don't mind me being here, right?
Stop asking that.
It's more fun with the three of us.
Well, that's good then.
Kicking back like this really is great.
It's only great because we work so hard.
Yeah. If I always came here, I wouldn't appreciate it as much.
Come on, time for food!
Wow, this looks amazing!
You guys are late, so I started drinking already!
Are you drunk, Kaya?
Here you go. Akito, thanks for treating me well this year.
Y-Yeah.
Mashiro, thank you as well. You always look out for Akito.
Thanks, but I don't really drink
Huh? What was that?
I'm drinking, I'm drinking.
I'm so full.
Can't eat another bite...
Now, it's time to begin the traditional ping pong competition!
Wait, right after eating?
Huh? What was that?
We'll do it, we'll do it!
Watch out
Kaya, you hit it too hard!
For a couple of guys, you two sure are weak!
I'll switch to my left hand just for you.
Don't underestimate me, dammit!
When I move around, everything spins...
I'm done for.
Mashiro, don't fall asleep.
And another year ends well.
We're going to watch the first sunrise of the new year.
Now, towards the new year!
The countdown's about to start!
Ten, nine...
Eight, seven...
Six, five...
Four, three...
Two, one...
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Let's do our best this year, too!
Yeah!
Reversi can do... it...
What're you doing?
Sending Azuki a Happy New Year text.
Another short text?
Miho does it, too.
It'd be strange if you two did anything else.
Oh, it's getting brighter.
I wish for another good year.
Let's turn Reversi into an even bigger hit.
Mashiro, aren't you going to wish for anything?
Huh? Are you supposed to wish for something on the first sunrise of the new year?
Isn't that supposed to be on your first visit to a shrine?
That's what we normally do.
I see. Then, I wish...
Mashiro! If you weren't Miho's boyfriend, I'd have you for myself!
Hey!
I'm really glad that you came along, Mashiro.
Hey, why are you crying?
Because it's good to be like this.
It makes me happy.
Don't you feel happy, too?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shuujin, Kaya. Thanks.
This is probably the most fun New Year's I've ever had.
Let's come here again.
Next time, Miho will be with us.
Saikou, are you still awake?
Yeah.
Kaya?
She fell asleep already.
I'm still wide awake, though.
I was just about to go to sleep myself.
Maybe I should sleep here, then.
That's gross.
During summer break of our third year in middle school, we slept under the same roof every night.
Summer break in middle school...
It feels nostalgic, but also like it was just yesterday.
You could say we've been working nonstop ever since then.
Nine and a half years.
It went by so fast.
Yeah.
There were hard times, but it was fun.
We've been lucky.
The Luck from Conceit, Hard Work, Luck.
I think meeting you was the luckiest thing that has ever happened to me.
If you hadn't asked me to make manga with you, I don't know what I'd be doing now.
You would have found some other goal to work towards.
I didn't have any of these outrageous dreams before
like becoming the number one manga artist in Japan, or marrying Azuki Miho.
Those dreams are right at my fingertips now.
Reversi can do it.
Mind if I say something pretentious?
Sure, say any snobby thing like A man who's away from home need feel no shame.
I think manga and life are the same thing.
A weekly manga lasts for a week, and a life lasts until you die.
It's making the best of whatever time you're given.
So, you can't hold back.
Conceit and Luck are important, but the most important one is
Hard Work.
That wasn't pretentious at all.
I think you're spot on.
Don't forget Strength of body, Strength of mind, and lastly, Guts!
Right?
Yeah.
Let's do our best!
When we get back, it's back to work!
You two could have taken some more time off, but you're really eager to get back to work.
I wasn't expecting you to finish this quickly.
Since we had free time, we thought we'd make the manuscript even better.
We've already had a reprint of your second volume, which went on sale on the 4th.
If you add in the total from your first volume, that makes 500,000 copies already.
All right!
But, Zombie Gun...
No, its second volume isn't on sale yet.
Right now, Reversi is selling more.
If it keeps going like this, you may catch up!
Yeah! Full speed ahead!
Yeah!
Both of them are plenty popular, but it's only been six months.
However, the CROW anime will end this summer.
In our present situation, it has to be one of these two.
Super popular!
Super popular!
Super popular!

Dense with content that kids can't understand!
If we want a wide audience, then it has to be Zombie!
Th-That's something the production staff will take into consideration.
What? Aida, you sound like you're really pushing for Reversi.
Yuujirou said that he doesn't want to do an anime right now.
So, it has to be Reversi.
Has Hattori said anything?
No.
He knows there's been some offers for an anime,
but he thinks it won't happen for a long time.
Then, ask Hattori what he thinks about this.
If he says okay, is Reversi definitely getting an anime?
No.
We have to ask him first if he wants the fall slot.
There's no point in discussing this until we've heard his answer.
And ask Yuujirou one more time.
An anime adaptation of Reversi?
Nothing's certain yet.
The Chief Editor wants to know if you'd want it to start this fall.
After CROW, then.
I see.
So, you're saying yes, then?
Give me a moment, please.
I need to think about this.
Why? There shouldn't be any problems with this.
Well... How many years did the CROW anime end up running for?
Um... A little under seven.
We'd rather have a work that we're satisfied with instead of one that has a long run!
At worst, going by what Ashirogi said, the series could finish before the anime even starts.
If they could just keep the series going while the anime is on air...
They're pretty stubborn, though.
They won't agree to keep it going unless they're completely satisfied with it.
What's going on? You look awfully serious.
Well, I'm happy about this, but I can't give you an answer that easily.
But why?
Normally you'd say either An anime?! or All right!, and that'd be it.
A-Anyways, just let me think about this first!
O-Okay, fine.
Make it quick.
So, I'm just confirming this with you,
but right now, Zombie Gun shouldn't be made into an anime yet, right?
It's too early.
Yeah.
The further ahead we are, the easier it will be to adapt this into an anime.
I think you need to continue for at least three more years before we consider it.
Roger.
So, the anime that'll start after CROW ends will probably be Reversi.
Reversi?!
If I tell Ashirogi, they'll definitely want to do the anime.
It's been their dream ever since they started to draw manga.
How about I tell them that in order to have an anime, they have to keep the series going for the duration of the anime?
However, if that causes the manga to get boring...
Maybe I should be honest and tell the higher-ups that the manga might end before the anime even begins.
But if I do that, we might lose the offer.
In the end, maybe it's best to simply keep quiet and just agree to the anime.
But that's just being irresponsible.
It's no use! This isn't something I can decide by myself.
Listen, don't freak out.
Don't freak, okay.
Keep calm and listen.
Okay.
This isn't definite yet,
but the higher-ups are asking me if we'd like to have an anime for Reversi in the fall.
A-Anime?
Yes!
Saikou!
Shuujin!
Finally!
No, wait!
It's not a sure thing!
They just wanted to know whether you'd want to do it this fall or not!
Of course we'd want that!
There's no way we wouldn't!
If we agree, then it's all settled, right?
We'll do it! For sure!
No, it isn't really decided yet.
Aww yeah!
Anime! Anime! Anime! Anime!
Just calm down!
Continue the series until the anime ends?
Yeah.
I mean that when the confrontation between the white and black demons, Weiss and Schwarz, concludes,
the three of us would sit down and figure out what happens next.
Were you given the condition that the series can't end while the anime is running?
No, they haven't gotten into that kind of detail yet.
But when you consider the anime production company's position,
they'd want it to last as long as possible.
An anime starting in the fall...
At our pace, by that time the confrontation between Schwarz and Weiss will be over.
Do we have to keep the series going for as long as the anime is running?
Like I said, that's not set in stone.
However, if I tell the higher-ups that you're planning to end the series right around when the anime starts,
this offer may be pulled off the table.
And I would feel guilty if I gave them the go-ahead for the anime without telling them about this.
So, if you could continue it until the anime ends...
No, if you could just tell me you'll keep it going a year into the anime, I'd feel a lot better.
Saikou, there's no way we can say no.
We won't end our manga until a year into the anime.
That's good enough, right?
Can you guarantee that the quality of the manga won't drop at all?
Reversi is a masterpiece!
I don't want to lower its quality by prolonging it!
Didn't we just decide not to do that?!
But you want it made into an anime, right?!
Of course I do!
Hattori.
By this fall, the manga will have been running for a year.
That's a year's worth of story material for the anime to work with.
Isn't that enough?
By that logic, it'd be best to pass up this opportunity and wait until you end the series,
and if an offer comes for an anime after that, we should take it then.
We can't do that!
We've finally got an offer, so we can't pass it up!
There's no way we can miss this chance!
Saikou, it's fine.
I just have to work really hard on the story.
I'll make it work, somehow.
Shuujin.
You mean you'll intentionally drag it out, even if the quality suffers?
No! I'll see to it that the quality doesn't drop!
What's going on? This isn't like you two.
Well, I was the one who wanted you to continue the manga, but this is just strange.
We want an anime, but not if it means dropping the quality of our work.
That's not it.
Takagi's doing this for me.
For my personal dream.
Hey, Saikou...
Back in middle school,
before I started to draw manga,
I made a promise to Azuki Miho, the voice actress.
That our manga would become an anime, and that she would play the lead female role in it.
And that once that dream came true, we'd get married.
Since then, neither of us has strayed from that path. We haven't gone on dates, or even seen each other.
I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's the truth.
Takagi asked me back then if I wanted to become a manga author with him.
And at the same time, coincidentally, this dream was born.
That's why I resolved to do it together with him.
Takagi is trying to fulfill that dream for me.
So that's the reason you are so obsessed with getting an anime?
I don't want our manga to get boring just for the sake of getting an anime and fulfilling my personal dream.
Just like you said, if an anime offer comes after we're done with our series, we can take it then.
What are you talking about?!
It won't get boring!
We have an offer now! We should accept it now!
No matter what!
No matter what?! Even if the quality of our manga goes down?
Azuki wouldn't want that either!
H-Hattori?
Ah, I'm sorry. It looks like I was wrong.
We have an offer. I should just honestly say I want to do it.
Because Ashirogi Mutou wants to do it.
It's fine.
Just do your series the way you want to.
I don't care when it ends.
If they complain, I'll accept responsibility for it.
Hattori...
Why did you suddenly...
It's a nice dream.
To have your work become an anime, and to have Azuki Miho play the heroine in it.
If that happens, then you get married.
And it's wonderful that you've had that dream since middle school.
In order to fulfill it, let's do this anime.
I'll support you!
Hattori...
I've become too much of an adult.
I may have lost that innocent way of thinking.
They asked if I wanted an anime.
I should have replied, Yes! I want it so badly!
That's all there is to it. Yeah.
Hey, Hattori came by here earlier, right?
Yeah, he did.
So, why do you guys look so relaxed?
Oh?
Do we?
Maybe it's because you're here!
Yeah! Because you're so cute!
Cute!
Super cute!
Who are you people?
I see. So Ashirogi are hyped up for it.
Yes! So please go ahead with Reversi's anime adaptation!

Yuujirou!
What's this?
Niizuma wrote these for the anime.
Original storyboards for Zombie Gun.
20 of them!
Original storyboards for an anime?!
But you said it was too early for an adaptation!
I thought so too, but...
Reversi?!
Yeah. As an Ashirogi fan, you must be happy for them, right?
I'm happy, but if their volume sales surpass mine, then I won't be anymore.
Well, yes.
If they get an anime, they might make a comeback in their sales.
Even so, there's no way we can stop a Reversi anime from happening.
If I said I wanted an anime of Zombie Gun, what would happen then?
But I've said over and over that it's too early for that! The anime would catch up way too quickly!
Then all I have to do is create a bunch of original stories for the anime!
I had simply assumed that we should turn the anime down because it would catch up to the manga.
But I didn't account for Niizuma's abilities. He can keep churning out these original storyboards for the anime!
These are good. He's made them with an anime in mindframes that will look good on TV.
Yeah. He really is a genius.
We're gonna do Zombie Gun! I'll make it the true number one series!
I already told Ashirogi that it was likely we'd do their series as a fall anime.
You told them already?!
Yes.
Oh, crap.
I never told you to ask the authors.
Sorry.
However, I also expected that you would say we shouldn't do Zombie Gun.
I should have been more careful in asking.
Sorry.
They've already been informed, and both Niizuma and Ashirogi are excited about it.
Are they both okay with this fall?
No matter which one we choose, both Zombie Gun and Reversi will eventually get an anime anyway.
Reversi has to be done now!
Same goes for Zombie Gun!
If you do Reversi now,
we might be overtaken in both volume sales and survey rankings.
This will decide which series...
is the true flagship!
The true flagship...
I'll have my decision by the end of the day.
Th-That's why I told you nothing was decided yet!
If Niizuma is drawing storyboards for the anime, then Zombie Gun has a stronger case.
It would follow up CROW, and it does seem like a more likely choice.
The Chief Editor will decide, but you probably shouldn't get your hopes up.
Mashiro
Hattori came yesterday, right?
Yeah.
So, why do you two look so unmotivated?
Oh?
We do?
That's strange.
Even though you're here...
Yeah. Even though the super cute Kaya is here...
What is with you two?
Oh, Hattori, come on in
Excuse me.
Uh, sure.

Why, I wonder?
Whenever I am close to fulfilling my goals, all effort becomes fruitless
We walk ahead, hold each other, and with little things
we support each other to reach what we promised
When we lack confidence, we put a hand to our heart
and reread the pages we assembled into a story
They lead up to today and continue into the morrow
We will always be ourselves
until the day that our dreams come true
