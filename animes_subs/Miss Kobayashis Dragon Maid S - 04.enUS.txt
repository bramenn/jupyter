Oh?
This is a really beautiful array of code.
Who wrote this?
I don't know.
Here's your tea, Miss Kobayashi.
Thanks, Elma.
Why are you staring at the code I wrote?
Is there something wrong with it?
No, the opposite.
I was impressed by Hmm?
What did you just say?
I wrote it.
I can grow, too.
I just assumed you'd be stuck serving tea forever.
You're the one who gave me all those books and told me to study!
I guess you do have high specs, since you're a dragon.
This is amazing, Elma!
Hmm? What?
Are you praising me?
I am!
This means we have another fighting member on our team!
You did well, Elma!
Well, just leave it to me!
Could you start by handling this, then?

And this one, this one, this one, and this one too.
We're counting on you.
You're asking too much of me, Miss Kobayashi!
No, no.
That's the amount of work you should be handling normally.
Huh?
Kobayashi-san's the one who's been
handling your share of the work while you were serving tea.
Kobayashi-san already has twice that much work on her plate, too.
Isn't that kind of incredible, Mister Takiya?
Yeah.
She's our pillar.
Pillar?
Miss Kobayashi's a pillar?
Miss Kobayashi!
Hmm?
I challenge you to a duel!
Huh?
Let's fight fair and square!
Huh?
Why so suddenly?
Maybe she's mad that I gave her too much work?
That's just how Elma is!
Hmm, I kind of understand how you feel when she comes after you.
She always challenges me to strange matches, too.
There were tests of strength,
seeing whose tail was longer,
and speed eating competitions, as well.
She even challenged me to so see who could strip travelers of their clothes first, once.
Are you two the North Wind and the Sun?
So, that's how you two played together all the time.
You're great friends.
No, we're not!
Normally we should be trying to kill each other.
Miss Kobayashi, please be careful around Elma.
Your gaze is a sharp as those in the chaos faction.
Is my resting face really that bad?
Good!
I'm glad you showed and didn't run away, Miss Kobayashi!
Well, I did consider taking PTO...
Can we settle things with this before we compete?
Limited Soft, Sweet Pudding
It's one of the limited-time sweets from the station. A soft, sweet pudding.
Oh!
Normally, this would satisfy Elma.
No! I'll take that when I win the match!
That's how she's taking it?

The winner will be whoever completes the most of this work that hasn't been touched yet.
All right!
You say it hasn't been touched yet, but someone's responsible for it, right?
Who's that?
That's me.
I'm taking PTO to go around Akiba with Faf-kun!
See you later!
That bastard. Thank you for all your hard work.
I can't tell if you're mad or thankful from that response.
Well, shall we get started?
Y-Yeah.
Though...
Of course this would be a dull competition.
It doesn't matter if I win or lose,
the work gets done either way.
Lunch time.
Want to go to the usual ramen shop?
Hey, come with us, Elma.
I'm not going. I'll finish this in the meantime.
Beating a mere human like me won't make you very happy, right?
If I made you mad, I'll apologize.
I'm not mad.
And don't sell yourself short.
Don't become a pillar, either.
A pillar?
That's right.
I've watched many humans become pillars in the other world.
What do you mean?
They support others by becoming a sacrifice.
Human sacrifices?!
The dragons of the harmony faction help humans,
but many of my companions claimed sacrifices in exchange.
Those people became human pillars and died...
I couldn't stand watching that.
This discussion's taken an awfully heavy turn.
So, I wish you'd stop sacrificing yourself and working so much!
I'll lead the others for you!
Elma, bring your head closer.
Then close your eyes.
Wh-What?
Miss Kobayashi, you already have Tohru.
Well, if you want that from me, I'm willing...
Ei!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Wh-What are you doing?!
Hmph. That's called an unnecessary concern.
What?
The world you live in now isn't the same as the one you came from.
So, don't go thinking everything is the same.
There are no human sacrifices in modern Japan.
Also, I still have my honor as your senior here, so don't steal my work.
I-I see.
Let's call an end to this competition, okay?
Okay.
I'm glad you were concerned for me.
Thank you, Elma.
Yeah.
Ahh, all done, all done.
Okay, Elma!
I'm taking you out for drinks with us today.
Drinks?
Takiya-kun's already standing by at our usual place.
I bet it'll be fun to drink with everyone.
Uh-huh. There are some things you can only talk about when liquored up, too.
Oh?! Now I'm excited!
And what's with that outfit?!
You dragons piss me off, always dressing like you can do anything!
I think this idea that you can just wear glasses is thoughtless!
Also, your breasts are outrageous!
As a fellow glasses wearer, there are big differences in size and frames!
If you're going to wear them, I wish you'd think about those things first!
I want to go home.
This is a popular collaboration cafe!
Here we go! Palflash!
We're lucky it's emptier on weekdays.
Yeah.
Sorry for the wait.
Here's the special bonus illustrated coaster you ordered.
There are 15 types, handed out at random.
You're in this with me until I collect them all!
Hmph, bring it on.
Urgent Notice
Beware Suspicious Person
Lately we've received several reports of a suspicious individual.
>Dressed Entirely In Black, Long Hair
That's scary.
They're recruiting people for patrols.
They actually approached me, too.
Huh?
They were hopeful after the skill
I showed catching that thief in the shopping district a while back.
Oh, yeah. That did happen.
Will this be okay?
Oh! You're worried for me?
No, for the suspicious person.
Goddammit!
Thanks for coming today, Tohru-chan.
It's unusual to see you in casual clothes.
Miss Kobayashi said I should wear some from time to time.
Patrol
So, what should I be doing?
Just walk around the area and see if you spot anything strange.
It's a little scary, though.
There's nothing that scares me.
In fact, please fear me!
My, how cute.
Miss Sasakibe, do you know any martial arts?
Not at all.
You'll be a hindrance if anything does happen, then.
Nothing is going to happen.
This town is very safe.
A red zone right away?!
Why today, of all days?!
Miss Sasakibe, Miss Sasakibe.
Yes?
They're blocking the street and getting in the way, right?
Let's go warn them.
Huh? But
Hey!
You're being a nuisance if you loiter there!
What?
You got a problem with us?
I do.
Are you some species that can't understand language?
Huh?!
Quit screwing with us!
You idiot!
He lashes out too fast!
Pinky Forehead Flick
Huh?
I'll only warn you one more time, so if you can't understand,
well, give up hope.
Get lost.
We'll make you regret picking a fight with Team Dragon Busters!
Now that's an irritating team name.
Well, let's refocus and get back to our patrol.
Oborozuka Shopping District
What will you do if they come back for revenge?
Well, of course I'd
Bean Jam Pancake
Bean Jam Pancake
Hmm?
Suspicious person!
This era's most suspicious person!
Wh-What?!
You're skipping work, aren't you?!
I got out early today... Hmm?
What's that armband for?
Patrol
I'm on patrol to maintain the peace.
Huh?
You are?
You're doing something to preserve the peace of the city?
I just said I am, didn't I?!
Really?!
You've finally found it for yourself?!
A sense of justice?!
Huh?
I'm so happy!
From today on you can be an agent of harmony, too!
Allow me to help you with the patrol!
I think she's misunderstanding something again.
Oh, would you like to take my place, then?
Miss Sasakibe?!
You said I'd be a hindrance, remember?
I'm a bit more experienced at detecting evil.
Ask me anything you want.
I'd like to know how I can get rid of you.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
You can be cute sometimes, too.
So annoying.
Besides, what do you consider evil, anyway?
I'll overlook a bit of misconduct as long as it's not bothering others.
There was a book of laws, right?
If they do anything against those, we need to warn them.
Hurry!
It's going to turn red!
Hey!
That's a clear traffic violation!
Enforcement Order For The Road Traffic Act Article 2 Flashing Blue Light With Person Shaped Symbol Pedestrians shall not begin crossing the road, and pedestrians currently crossing the road must either quickly finish crossing or cease crossing and return to their starting side.
You could be fined up to 20,000 yen!
I'll punish you villains!
Stop, stop.
What are you doing to kids?
What?!
You're defending evil?!
You really are a chaos dragon!
Calm down.
I'm scared!
If you're going to go after all those little things, I'm going home.
And what was that about punishment?
Violence is way worse, you know?
Tohru, you're starting to resemble Miss Kobayashi, aren't you?
Huh?! Really?!
Elma, you get it, don't you!
Annoying.
You keep focusing on the little things because you're walking without purpose.
Let's search for the suspicious person.
What are they like?
According to the flier, the suspicious person was dressed entirely in black with long hair.
Apparently he's also a tall man with sharp eyes and glasses.
Oh, that's pretty easy to understand.
They said he was spotted dancing on the route to the elementary school.
I see. Like that, then?
School Zone
Yes, just like that.
What's the meaning of this?
I was practicing the choreography for an event with Takiya.
Why here?
Because our room's too small.
You're a fearsome dragon, so please show more prudence.
She's right. Think about your persona.
And you two?
Patrol
We're on patrol.
Well, good work.
A chaos faction member and a harmony faction member happily together...
It would seem this world causes us to go crazy.
And you're the one who's gone the craziest from it.
Are you going to lecture me about being too influenced by it again?
No.
Lately I kind of understand, but...
I still think it's dangerous.
The common sense of this world
doesn't completely mesh with our understanding,
so never forget that.
But isn't reconciling that kind of fun?
Found you!
You did us real good earlier, huh?
Looks like you're pretty capable,
but this time that guy's here.
The strongest local delinquent,
Dragon
the Dragon of Destruction!
A woman, huh?
If you can fight, gender doesn't matter.
But if you can't fight, hurry up and apologize.
Oh, you'll fight?
I won't show any mercy, then.
Get her, Ryuu-san!
Ryuu-san!
Good grief, with this many...
I'll get the clothes Miss Kobayashi gave me dirty.
Ryuu-san!
I told you, didn't I?
If you can't understand, give up hope.
Ryuu-san!
I'll make sure you can never oppose me again.
Ryuu-san!
Shut up!
Oh, hello, Tohru-san!
Hello!
Hello.
You're getting a lot of greetings today.
Ryuu-san, let's go home already.
I won't just quietly stay defeated!
I'll get stronger and have my revenge!
Ryuu-san!
I-It's a bear!
Heh.
Perfect.
I'll show you I've gotten stronger!
Ryuu-san!
Episode 4
When in Rome, Do as the Romans Do (It's Hard to Match Others)
Take, take, take me away somewhere,
jump, jump, jump to Parkour Land!
I want to go to an amusement park!
Huh?
I never did understand what was so fun about amusement parks.
Mrr!
Have you never been to one, Miss Kobayashi?
Spot On
If so, we can go and tell you what it's like.
A dragon's going to teach me something about this world?
No.
Oh, well! I'll take you to one, since I know them so well!
This is an exception, though!
Yay!
Can I invite Saikawa, too?
Sure.
Parkour Land
We're here.
What is this place?
It's hard to believe we're still in the same country.
Right? So this is the kind of place it is.
Huh?!
No, it's nothing!
The unusual...
The fact that you encounter things you can only find here creates memories,
and the things you interact with let you forget your daily life.
That voice!
Georgie-sa Huh?!
Yes, I am your guide to this world of dreams.
This too could be considered a type of a parlor maid.
Isn't that too broad an interpretation?
Part-time job?
My father's acquaintance runs this park, so I'm helping him out.
Oh, right, there's a cafe I think you'd like here in this area.
Parkour Land Park Map
Oh? We'll go try it.
Hey! I'm Parkour Land's Acro!
I can feel the passion.
Have fun here today!
Kobayashi, I'm going to go play with Saikawa and the others.
All right.
Meet back up at the Ferris wheel at four.
Now, what shall we do?
It's just the two of us adults now, isn't it?
Why are you readying a security buzzer?
Mirror House
Wow, a room lined with mirrors, huh?
There are so many reflections of me.
What do they have all these mirrors here for?
To reexamine and reevaluate yourself.
Because it's a maze.
I see.
I have to accept that I'm in human form right now.
I have to say, you're progressing rather quickly, Tohru.
I can generally tell the way from the echoes of sound.
You're like a bat.
Curse you!
I'm scared of props!
Calm down, Saikawa.
I'll protect you.
Haunted House
Entrance
Exit
I know this one.
You spin this here.
Huh.
What makes this fun?
Uh, centrifugal force?
Having some fun
You mean humans try to experience a stronger rotational force
to make themselves aware that they're under the sway of the planet's rotation?
Centrifugal force and rotational force aren't
No, let's go with that!
That!
Let's go with that?
Can I try spinning it, too?
Go ahead.
There!
Oh!
What is this? How do you play with it?
Oh!
What is this? It's fun!
Spinning around.
Sorry, I did it again.
You're so funny, Saikawa.
This, too, is a maid's duty.
Unicorn, huh?
He really loves virgins.
Would he love me, too, then?
Your virginity is mine, so he can't have it.
Scary.
Have some candy.
Lucky!
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Saikawa, is yours yummy, too?
Yeah. Oh, sorry, though.
I ate all of it.
That one tastes yummy, too.
Oh, she held it back.
I can do it when it counts!
Really?
Me, too.
That was fun!
You sure complained quite a bit, though.
As long as I'm with you,
even the depths of the abyss where light never reaches would be fun!
I wouldn't have fun there.
Though, I suppose you're right about it being fun because we're together.
You had fun, too, didn't you, Miss Kobayashi?
The cafe Georgie-san mentioned should be around here.
I know that.
That's the Victorian style you mentioned once before.
Ah!
The best smile she's had at any place we went today?!
Thank you.
Thank you, Georgie-san.
The taste is average.
Who to drink it with, huh?
You'll drink it with me, right?
Parkour Land
Where are they?
Saikawa, are you okay?
I-I'm fine.
I'm just a little too happy.
Georgie.
Hot Dogs
French Fries
You young ladies look like you're having fun.
I took very nice photos of you all.
Oh, show me, show me!
Ah, Kobayashi, you're late!
Sorry, sorry.
I stayed there too long...
Shall we all ride the Ferris wheel, then?
Did Georgie-san take those photos?
We all screamed and had fun.
I'd love to live in a place this fun.
Sorry that my place is ordinary and boring.
What's the matter, Tohru?
Nothing, I've just been thinking.
These rides make very sharp turns and rock up and down.
Then there's the buildings with detailed designs
and mascot costumes modeled after fantastical beasts.
Is she feeling nostalgic?
This...
is a facility to simulate riding a dragon, isn't it?!
Huh?
I can't believe they'd make these things just because they can't ride dragons themselves.
Humans are so despicable!
How did you even jump to that interpretation?!
In other words, if you rode me you could experience an amusement park every day!
You only have roller coasters!
Still, something like this every now and then isn't so bad.
It is bad for my hips, though.
Nae.
Nae?
Georgie.
Oh, yes.
Good morning.
You've forgotten your own name, haven't you?
Next Episode Preview
Kanna-san's Mom,
I brought the photos from the amusement park.
There's a thousand!
That's a lot.
Really?
Let's select the best, then.
Going through each one.
That's harsh.
I got it, I'm sorry.
They're all okay, then.
