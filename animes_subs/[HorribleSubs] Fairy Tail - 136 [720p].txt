My fake out worked!
I ain't done yet!
It wouldn't be interesting if you were!
Is this really it?
I think so.
The key rests peacefully, surrounded by voices in prayer.
Prayer? Then it must mean the chapel, right?
But is there a place in here where it could be kept hidden?
I'll get a bird's-eye view!
And while Natsu was battling it out in the crypt,
Erza and her team
were face-to-face with something bizarre in the Magic Library.
What is this?
I don't know...
Ow!!
Run!
Who's gonna clean this up?
True Evil Revisited!
The Jiggle Butt Gang!
Goddess!
I missed you!
Was it you bastards?
The ones that did something unspeakably terrible to Wendy that last time?!
Terrible?!
Did you not put Wendy in a horrendous outfit?!
Outfit...?
You mean this?!
That's...
She was happy to wear it!
It looked good on her!
It's ripped to shreds!
To make Wendy wear that hideous costume...
You people are fiends!
That's right! Poor thing!
Ever since that train robbery,
Carla has been having nightmares about it!
That's right... Every night, an army of Wendys in black full body tights
chases me around!
That nightmare has come back to haunt me...
Carla! Stay with me!
A nightmare, eh?
Lackeys, assemble!
Yes, sir!
Did you hear that?! We're terrible!
Terrified of nightmares! That's the highest compliment we could get, right, Boss?!
And here on in, we're gonna keep scarin' people and givin' em nightmares, right, Boss?!
Wait, Lackey B. That one's a cat...
Terrible? We're terrible?!
That's right! We're the truly evil...
We already know your name.
You're the ones who made that big mess, so you better put all those books back!
You heard her. Clean'em up, you two!
You knocked them down, Boss!
Don't talk back!
As your punishment, give me 36 push-ups!
Wha...?!
A half-assed number again...
Just do it!
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10...
What is this?
Are they really comedians?
We're not comedians!
We use farts to steal by force!
That was a really manly thing to say!
Truly evil deeds!
What about your push-ups?
We finished'em!
What were you doing here?
Everyone in the criminal underworld knows...
Right now, Fairy Tail is searching for an incredible treasure
that will turn the world upside down!
So if we can snatch it first,
the Jiggle Butt Gang will become the rulers of the world!
No!
Carla...
Why are you wearing that?
I thought this might happen, so I came prepared.
That's our goddess!
It feels wonderful!
I wanna follow you the rest of my life!
Everyone, have you forgotten what I said?
Give up being truly evil and study for the sake of your own future!
You're actually good people.
You're only forcing yourselves to act like you're evil!
Please, find your true selves!
Our true selves...?
Please remember what it was like when you were children.
You'd race through the fields and get all muddy, playing'til the sun went down...
And you'd laugh with your friends, sharing your dreams...
I'm sure you'll be able to see your true selves.
I wonder how serious she is...
I have a feeling she's totally serious...
Boss!
What should we do?!
That's pathetic, lackeys!
What kind of truly evil criminals would cry over this?!
I think being truly evil is our true selves!
But if you disagree, then tell us!
What are the true selves of the Jiggle Butt Gang?!
What are you doing?
I'm saying I'll play along with your idea.
But then you have to go along with one of our rules!
Erza, don't!
Fine.
Are you... alright?
What's that flower?
I picked it while we were on our picnic.
It smells good.
One point to glam it up! Impressive!
This isn't so uncomfortable.
Yeah, right?!
But let me ask you something.
How proud are you of these black suits?
Proud?
That's right.
If you call yourselves truly evil, I'm sure you have one or two things.
Your own philosophy of evil. I'd like you to tell me about the art of evil.
U-Um, have you forgotten why we're really here?
No. I refuse to dance to the tune of morons
calling themselves truly evil.
I'm going to beat the warped nature out of you!
Jiggle, jiggle!
Now's our chance.
I think this is Erza-san's strategy.
She wants us to look for the part while she distracts them, right?
I don't know about that. Erza looks too serious.
Erza's true intent aside, what Wendy said makes sense.
Take this.
If we find the part, I'll contact you through this.
Okay!
You're staying here?
Well, I am their goddess, so...
Do you actually like that outfit...?
Never mind, let's go!
Anyway, I keep thinking about Legion.
Oh yeah?
They involved people who have nothing to do with this by spreading the word...
Is chaos what they're after?
Maybe both chaos and confusion...
But there's no point dwelling on it. Right now, we have to...
This is probably the place that Lucy guessed.
Time sleeps on a pillow of ancient magic wisdom.
That line is a clue.
A pillow of wisdom?
All of these books are on ancient magic.
This ancient wisdom is from an age before printing technology and had to be transcribed by hand.
The knowledge and techniques from that ancient age
have only been preserved at the Magic Library.
And the clock part is somewhere in here?
It must be hidden...
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Crap! It's blinding!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
What are you laughin' for?!
Your magic isn't so hot.
I actually thought this since the last time we clashed,
but your attacking power isn't as impressive as it looks.
What?!
Samuel was telling us.
He said time stopped for you people for seven years.
Which means your magic is at the level it was seven years ago!
So what?!
While you were frozen in time, I was building myself up.
And now, here I am!
There's no way I'll lose to a man from seven years ago!
I don't know what the hell it is you're proud of!
But it's neither here nor there!
I'm always at full power!
Brilliant Blaze of the Fire Dragon!
It's useless!
Him...
Natsu-nii!
Natsu!
Natsu!
Lun-lun! I found you!
Him again!
And his nickname for her has changed again...
Now, come to me!
Shut up!
You butt out!
You didn't learn your lesson!
You did it again!
So, Lu-tan...
Stay away from me!
Take this!
Don't you have the capacity to learn either?!
Natsu!
Na...tsu...
You didn't do that on purpose, did you?
You accuse me too, Michelle?
We didn't know this black costume had a secret like that!
Will you cry for me, lackeys?
Boss!
Erza-san, what should we do?
I don't know how to react to that story...
I can't cry.
So you spilled ink on a T-shirt when you were a kid
and were afraid your parents would be mad, so you dyed the whole thing black with ink.
How is that worthy of tears?!
It's a heroic story!
You're soft!
That isn't evil!
What?!
In the first place, your subordinates fawn on you because you do that kind of thing!
If you're going to call yourself a leader, you have to set an example for your followers!
You're kind of getting off track again...
And so, you! Give me 100 push-ups!
What?!
If you're going to force your subordinates to do push-ups, first show them how it's done!
If your evil behavior is half-assed, your push-ups are going to be half-assed, too!
Give me 100 honest push-ups!
What?!
Boss!
Make her eat crow by knockin' out 100 push-ups!
Nobody says eat crow these days...
Boss! Please!
Those gazes full of hope make my heart ache... I'll do it!
Fine. I'll do it.
Watch me, lackeys! This is truly evil!
He's so fast!
The Boss never disappoints!
Um... Maybe you should pace yourself...
And so, things are messed up beyond all recognition at the Magic Library.
Meanwhile, the chaos is deepening here, too.
Go ahead, fire. You'll just end up destroying this place.
Romeo, he's right! We mustn't use magic here!
Dammit!
Lu-pyon!
Come, with God as our witness, let's continue with our wedding ceremony!
Enough already!
Wait for me!
Do it by yourself!
Michelle! Do something!
Anyway, we need to get him out of here!
He doesn't know yet that the part might be in here.
But how can we get him out?
I've got a good idea!
I thought of something, too.
What? What is it?
Tell me, too!
Be a decoy!
D-Decoy?
Right now, the only thing that can attract Dan's attention...
That's great! Do it!
How am I supposed to be a decoy?
Wedding ceremony!
Why?!
The important thing is using his feelings!
Fine!
Dan!
What is it, Lu-nyan?
I want you... to come over here...
Huh?
She's not being stimulating enough?
That alone is not gonna do it...
It's love!
Catch me if you can!
I'll catch you, alright! Wait up!
He fell for it!
It's working perfectly!
Natsu-nii! Now!
Okay! Go, Happy!
Aye, sir!
Maybe it's power from seven years ago,
but when we use it together as a team,
we make out okay!
Romeo!
Gotcha!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
You did it, Natsu-nii!
How was that?!
He's finally quiet!
What's this?!
The wall is glowing...
I-It's huge!
This is...
It was here the whole time?!
The impact just now must have activated the hiding device thing!
That's awesome, Natsu-nii!
Well, I knew it would do that...
Yeah, right! But anyway, we finally got one!
What's wrong, Happy?
After all, this is the first time using Lucy's sexual charms worked!
You don't have to say it's the first time!
I found them at last!
Thirty... eigh...
Boss, hang in there!
Show us your spirit!
M-My arms...
So you're just all talk, huh?
Are you okay?
I'm not givin' in...
The Jiggle Butt Gang's pride and joy... is this!
Lackeys!
Gas-Butt... Triple... Ecstasy!
Erza-san, get out of the way!
W-What... is this?!
I kind of remember this smell!
Cana! Are you okay?!
Cana... Huh?
A secret passage...
Maybe it opened thanks to that smell...
Though it's still lingering in my nostrils...
This has to be it!
The part of the clock...
I guess we should be grateful for that stink.
Did you see our power?!
What a... vulgar skill...
Cana-san found the part!
The treasure?! In that case...
Point Blank... Ecstasy!
Erza-san!
How are we going to carry this out?
Eat this!
That's what you get! And the butts get the last laugh!
How are you going to make this up to me?
You dared befoul my memento?!
Divine punishment!
We'll be back!
They're gone...
I hope they don't come back again...
Erza, are you alright?
My head is still reeling.
By the way, how are we going to carry this?
What? We can just bring it along with my things.
Hey, not yet?
Don't complain, just dig!
Jeez! Slave driver...
Well, we have no choice...
What's wrong?
Somebody's watching us.
What?!
Somebody... Who?!
You noticed?
A Legionnaire!
What do you want?!
It's obvious, isn't it?
We want the same thing.
Okay, Natsu, imagine you and I are both hungry.
There are two fish in front of us. What would you do?
Eat both of them.
Okay, what if there were four fish?
I'd eat all four.
I-I see...
Natsu, aren't you forgetting that I'm hungry, too?
I'd save some for you too, Happy.
How would you split it?
Next time: Something Beyond Reckoning!
I would eat all the meat and you would eat the bones.
See, that's splitting fifty-fifty!
You might be an idiot, but at least you care.
