Don't you die, Goku.
Father...
That guy's intense. It's no use. This is all over.
It's not like I'm desertin' ya, though.
There's just nothin' I can do.
Don't go holdin' it against me,'kay?
Suffer good and long, and then die!
It's close! We're almost there!
Even though it's the evening, because of that strange light, it's as bright as this.
W- what the hell is that thing?
K- Kuririn- san, o- over there!
Get down, Gohan! Get down, and hide!
W- what is that?
Hurry up, you stupid twit!
Ah, it's those guys.
lt can't be... He's turned into a Great Ape!
Feels like most of your bones just broke, huh? Does it hurt?
Goku is getting done in! This is bad!
This way!
Right!
Hey!
Yajirobe!
Hey, who d'ya think that monster is? It's the Saiyan, I tell ya, the Saiyan!
I know.
There's no way you can stand up to that monster, you know! Give it up!
I know that, too. But if we cut off his tail, he'll return to normal.
His tail?
His tail?
Listen up.
Gohan and Yajirobe, you guys circle around in front of him, and get his attention.
I'll find an opportunity to cut off his tail from the back!
Hurry! Goku is going to die!
R- right.
Y- ya gotta be kiddin' me.
Get his attention, did'ja say? You guys don't even know!
Even after he's back to normal, he's still gonna have unbelievable strength!
Father, don't die!
Goku's Ki is almost completely gone! Dammit, he's moments from death!
Eh, do whatever you wanna.
There's something out there.
Where is it?
Over here!
L- let my father go!
This is a surprise. If it isn't Kakarrot's kid.
I get it. So you've come here just to see your father meet his end, have you?
You've got good timing. He was just about to die.
I was right about to finish him off.
Kienzan!!
Damn it all...
Watch very closely. I'm going to crush him until there's nothing left.
Kuririn-san, hurry!
Unfortunately, it appears he has already lost consciousness.
I- i- it can't be!
Did you think I wouldn't notice that there was another one of you?
You guys seem to share some worthless attachment for each other, after all.
There's no way this kid would just come strolling back by himself,
so I was just waiting to see what would happen.
Apparently, you know about our tails. Too bad for you.
Just you wait. Once I've taken care of Kakarrot, it will be your turn next.
D - damn! What kind of beast is this?
Even after turning into a monster,
he still has his presence of mind and his guard is flawless.
l'm sorry, Goku. I don't want to just let you die,
but this guy's Ki is so incredible, l can't even get close to him.
You guys were mistaken to have challenged me to battle!
Dammit! If we don't do something...
Stop...
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
So, you want to die ahead of your father, do you?
T- this is bad!
What's the matter? Too scared to move?
Dammit! I didn't know there was yet another one!
My tail!
H- he did it!
I got nothin' to do with this...
I- I got nothin' to do with this from here on...
I- it's gone! His tail is gone!
You did it, Yajirobe! He returned to his original form!
lt's not my problem... Whatever happens now, it's not my problem...
W- why, you!
You want to die so badly that you've made me angry!?
W- what's going on? Why did that monster-?
In that case, as you wish, I will kill you, you miserable scum!
There, ya see?
Gohan! Get out of there!
I'll start with you.
What's the matter? Wasn't a Super Saiyan supposed to be strong?
Show me your true power.
Maybe the order has been changed.
There, you see? Don't say I didn't warn ya.
Come on, get up! Amuse me a little while longer.
Hey, what's wrong? Is that the best you can do?
I guess the son of scum...
You may be scum, but it looks like your blood is red, at least.
How awful!
How can he be so cruel to a child!?
She's strangely tranquil, huh?
I'm sure she must have run out of tears.
She hasn't fainted, has she? Hey!
Hey!
Ee-yow!
-Yow! Yow! Yow! -Fight...
Fight.
Fight! Fight, Gohan! Fight!
Avenge your daddy's death! Get up, Gohan! Fight, Gohan! Fight!
How about I at least let you die next to your father? I'll be kind.
G- Gohan...
Oh? Kakarrot, you're a tough one. You're still conscious, are you?
Gohan, can you hear me?
Gohan, your daddy's whole body is a mess. I can't move anymore.
Fight in my place. His power should have dropped considerably.
I- I can't, Father! He's too strong! I can't beat him!
All right, I'll do it this way- I'll follow my order, and kill Kakarrot first.
Next will be Kakarrot's kid.
After that, I'll finish off that bald bastard from earlier.
Finally, I'll kill the bastard who cut off my precious tail!
He remembered me, huh?
You don't have to beat him... Just keep him bottled up...
Your power should be even more incredible than his... even more...
While you're doing that, I'll have Kuririn finish him off...
I can't! I can't even move anymore!
You stupid jackass! Do you want everyone else's deaths to be in vain?
What did Piccolo teach you?
I'm counting on you, Gohan...
For left-behind scum, you're sure giving me a lot of trouble!
G- Gohan!
What's the matter!? Eh!?
S- stop... that...
Die!
Stop... that!
What's the matter? Die! Die!
Stop that!!
What!?
I'm going...
You are going to defeat me?
What the!?
Kuririn!
Kuririn, please! Come here!
D- dammit...
Don't you mess around with Vegeta- sama!
G- Goku, it's hopeless. He's just too terrible.
Why didn't you tell Gohan to run away?
I'm going to give this to you now, Kuririn...
The Genki Dama that I gathered from all over the earth...
Eh? What did you say? What are you going to give me?
A- a Genki Dama... Ki that I've collected from everything on earth...
About half of it got away, but I think it will still defeat him, the way he is now...
W- what?
Kuririn... take my hand...
I don't understand this at all.
Hurry! Gohan is going to die!
I just have to take your hand?
Please...
Like this?
Your bones are broken, aren't they?
That's okay... Don't let go...
I'm giving it to you now, so take it...
W- w- what is this?
I- it's awesome... This is a tremendous amount of Ki!
Turn your palm upward, and focus it... You can make it into a ball...
You dirty brat!!
Hang in there...
Gohan ain't able to control this kind of Ki...
I- it came out! Is this-?
A Genki Dama... You did it!
You're a pesky brat!
Kuririn... hit him with it... I can't make another Genki Dama...
M- make sure you hit him! Please!
U- understood. I'll try.
Will the Genki Dama that has been entrusted to Kuririn be able to put a stop to Vegeta?
