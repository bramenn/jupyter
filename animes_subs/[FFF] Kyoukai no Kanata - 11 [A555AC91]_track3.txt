Kuriyama Mirai is alive.
Come to the Literary Club's Clubroom.
Kuriyama Mirai is alive.

Akihito!
Mitsuki...
Thank goodness! You're awake!
What about Kuriyama-san? Where's Kuriyama-san?!
If demons are the product of human resentment,
then this is the embodiment of the hatred that humans harbor.
How perfectly fitting...
for someone such as myself.

Three months?
Yeah. You were in a coma the entire time.
It's been that long?
What do you expect? You lost your immortality.
Beyond the Boundary lived inside of you for a long time.
After having it ripped out like that,
it's amazing that you even survived.
What?
So my immortality didn't come from being a half-demon?
Probably not.
I could be wrong, though.
You need to have a talk with your mother.
So what happened to Kuriyama-san?
Kuriyama Mirai vanished.
To save you, she used all of her blood.
She vanished off the face of the planet along with Beyond the Boundary.
So she's dead?
I have a hard time imagining any other possibilities.
What was that sound?
What sound?
I didn't hear anything.
There! I heard it again.
Big Bro!
Akkey, look at me. Notice anything different?
Right. I am not wearing a scarf.
In other words, I have overcome my sensitivity to the cold.
So what of it?
My extreme sensitivity to the cold was caused by my supernatural powers.
If I've gotten over it, that can only mean that my powers are weakening.
Something feels off.
Perhaps it's related to those sounds.
Thank you for waiting!
Here's your extra rice omelette and large rice omelette!
Well, he hasn't eaten anything for three months.
So, being a demon yourself, what do you think?
Akkey said he's hearing sounds coming from the sky.
Beyond the Boundary originally resided inside of Kanbara-kun.
Considering how that terrifying creature has left his body
and how he is hearing sounds that we can't,
I believe it must be related to Beyond the Boundary.
Hiromi, where is Izumi-san?
What will you do if I tell you?
She knew everything, didn't she?
Talking to her would be a waste of time. I've already told you everything.
Akkey, how many times do you think I talked to Izumi about this while you were sleeping?
So you made Kuriyama Mirai decide to take her own life?!
Why didn't you tell us about this?
If we knew what was going on...
If you knew?
What would you have done if you knew?
Would you have stopped Kuriyama-san?
Or would you have assisted in killing Akihito-kun?
W-Well...
Take your pick. Those were the only two options.
If it were up to you, who would you have killed?
And that was enough to shut you up?
Then what should we have done?! Yell at Izumi to give Kuriyama Mirai back?
Like I know! Why don't you think about it?
Knock it off, guys.
Thank you for waiting! Here is your rice omelette gratin!
Akihito, you've got room for more?
I didn't order this!
But I did.
Once every couple thousand years, the demon known as Beyond the Boundary appears,
having grown from years of human resentment.
Some say that it is nature's way of scaring sense into mankind,
since it seems to appear when we have lost sight of our reason to exist, blinded by our bitterness.
Normally, no one would be able to survive with such a powerful demon inside their body.
However, for some unknown reason, you were able to contain it in your body.
You became the terribly dangerous immortal half-demon.
Even I do not know how that came to be.
If anyone knows, it would be your
I don't care about any of that crap!
Now tell me about Kuriyama-san!
Why did you have her come here?
Beyond the Boundary was a demon that could only be defeated by the clan with cursed blood.
That was the sole reason.
But we ran into a problem.
Kuriyama Mirai declared that she did not want to kill you.
So I had no choice but to inform her of a way that would save you...
a method that could only be used during the Calm.
Do you seriously expect that explanation to cut it?
You knew that Kuriyama-san would choose to save me!
Indeed. You are free to hate me if you so wish.
But as a member of the Nase family, I am obligated to protect everyone.
It is my duty to protect this world!
And there was someone Kuriyama Mirai wanted to protect.
This person meant more to her than life itself.
She wanted to protect him, even at the cost of her own life.
She protected that person of her own free will.
I am grateful to Kuriyama Mirai.
If she had not made that decision, we would not be standing here now.
In fact, the world itself would be gone.
She predicted that you would believe that she didn't understand what she was doing.
Well, he doesn't either, she said.
The days keep getting shorter, don't they?
I thought I could do it since this is a dream.
It really is hard, isn't it?
Farewell.
Don't give me that.
If you're looking for Mirai, she hasn't come back home.
Inami-san...
Where's Mirai?
Answer me! Where's Mirai?!
Don't just...
Don't just turn your back and sulk like that.

I don't know whether or not you will receive this text.
In other words, I don't know if you'll be able to read this message at all.
Senpai, it's Kuriyama Mirai!
After I send this, I'll be on my way to see you.
I'll go... and defeat Beyond the Boundary.
I feel very strange right now.
I think I might even be happy!
I was born into a clan with cursed blood, which gave me nothing but hardship.
I was always asking myself, Why was I even born?
Deep down, a part of me wanted to die.
But I was wrong to feel that way.
I'm glad I was born!
People say my powers are cursed. They say they detest my powers.
But I've come to realize that my powers aren't meant to hurt others.
They're meant to save people!
I'm glad I've lived this long. I'm so happy I'm not dead!
I'm truly glad that I came to this town and met you!
I was much, much happier than I had ever realized!
I was never cursed at all!
Senpai...
Senpai, you can die like a normal person now.
That means... That means you can live like a normal person now.
Live, just like you told me to back then.
Senpai? I...
Those Nase fools actually believe that everything ended the moment the cursed blood vanished.
But after Beyond the Boundary was pulled out of Kanbara Akihito's body,
it escaped death by fusing with Kuriyama Mirai's blood.
Despite growing increasingly weaker, it is currently fighting against Mirai Kuriyama.
In an effort to fight back, it is sapping power from countless demons and Exterminators.
It's using their powers in addition to its own in an attempt to defeat Kuriyama Mirai.
It even created an isolated dimension.
Now what would happen if I were to amplify its powers further?
Hey, Izumi-san...
I hope you're paying attention!
What is that? What's going on?
What is this?
Ai!
What's going on?
What's that?

Senpai, you have to hide!
Senpai...
Senpai, I will...
I will protect you!
What's that thing in the sky?!
Beats me! But I'm sure it's related to those sounds Akkey mentioned.
A demon?!
Nino-san?!
Looks like we're gettin' another festival!
What the
What the heck is going on?!
Inami-san?
Look.
Akkey!
Hiromi? What are you guys doing here?
Someone sent these letters to us.
Look!
They're being lifted up.
Let's hurry!
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
Crap! Back up!
What is it?
A demon?
A trap?
Come on!
Just back up already!
Th-That's...
Don't go after it! It's too risky!
Oh, darn!
What is wrong with you?! Do you even realize what's going on outside?!
Why did you have to raineth on my parade?! I was about to bursteth in like a cool
Dammit! I haven't seen you in forever, and this is the first thing you do?!
Were you the one who wrote those letters, too?
Why do you have to make things more difficult than they should be?!
Th-That doth hurt! This is domestic violence!
This is ED!
ED? It would be DV, you moron of a mother!
Ah! You called me a moron.
Who's that?
Akkey's mother.
Well, it takes one to know one!
Akkun's entered his rebellious stage.
Anyone would rebel if you were their mom!
Hate to spoil the happy reunion, but...
Mind asking your mother why she had us gather here?
Is it true? Is Kuriyama-san really alive?
Aye, her fire still burns.
Even now, Mirai-chan is waging war all on her own.
I am forbidden from helping her,
but if Beyond the Boundary emerges victorious, it would spell the end of our world.
As this is an emergency situation, I hath decided to disobey the rules.
Akihito, her speech doesn't even match her costume.
Can you make her stop?
I'll kick her.
No, that kind of attention is exactly what she wants. Try to ignore it.
So how can we save Kuriyama-san?
Before I tell you that, there is something else I must say.
Everyone, if you wanna rush to Kuriyama Mirai's side
Quit screwing around and tell us how to save her!
Very well!
L-Look down.
A defeated demon?
What's wrong with it?
Isn't that what we got when we defeated the Hollow Shadow?
That is not the Hollow Shadow.
No way!
Right! This is part of Akkun.
In other words, it is also part of Beyond the Boundary.
Inside of Beyond the Boundary, Kuriyama Mirai
or rather, the strength of her emotions
created a puppet version of Akihito.
Do everything you can to catch it!
That stone should carry you up there.
How do you know all of this?
Didn't you know?
Your mother is the one and only Kanbara Yayoi.
I expect you to tell me about myself someday.
Jeez! You scared me!
Kanbara Yayoi!
Don't startle me, Izumi!
Now you'd better get a move on!
Wait! What do you think you can accomplish?
You're no longer...
I'm not immortal!
I know that.
But I'm still willing to do anything for glasses or a bespectacled beauty...
because I'm a pervert!
