Gomen ne sunao ja nakute yume no naka nara ieru
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen ima sugu aitai yo
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight denwa mo dekinai midnight
Datte junjou dou shiyou heart wa mangekyou

Seiza no matataki kazoe uranau koi no yukue
Onaji kuni ni umareta no miracle romance

I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like a super heroine, but I am!
As you know, I transform myself by using a peculiar brooch
and fight against bad guys.
I'm the sailor warrior of love and justice, Sailor Moon!
And my friends are the smart and sweet Ami Mizuno
and a slightly quick-tempered psychic girl, Rei Hino.
Both of them are so dependable, I feel like I'll fall behind.
But anyway, I just have to do my best!
A Powerful New Enemy! Nephrite's Evil Crest
Jadeite randomly stole energy from anybody.
If you ask me, that is a ridiculous way to take care of business.
Really?
Then Nephrite, how would you do it?
I will not go after big groups of people like Jadeite did.
I will show you that I can get enough energy from one individual.
Is that so?
All humans are controlled by the movement of the stars.
And every one of them has their own fate.
The same is true of their energy.
Each human has a moment in their life when their energy level peaks.
In short, I will read the movement of the stars
and go after the humans when their energy level has peaked.
You seem very confident.
Zoisite, why are you here?
Overconfidence can be your downfall.
Go away!
I will infiltrate the human world
and take advantage of their weaknesses.
I do not need advice from you!
I can picture you throwing yourself at Queen Beryl's mercy.
Ooh, how scary.
Nephrite, I leave this in your hands.
Oh, there she is!
Rui, how are you doing?
Do you think you can win the next tournament?
I don't know.
Everyone in Japan is cheering for you. Please say something!
Sorry, but I have practice.
The stars know everything.
O stars, grant me your mysterious powers.
The proud Sagittarius, Chiron,
is about to fire his arrow at the center of the Milky Way.
The target that Sagittarius has chosen...
Rui Saionji, I will take your energy.
Saionji, go for it!
Saionji! Saionji, go for it!
Saionji!
Yeah! She did it!
Rui, sister, you're the best!
I never knew.
Knew what?
That Rui was your older sister. Knew what?
That Rui was your older sister.
Huh?
I will punish you if you keep secrets from your friend! Huh?
I will punish you if you keep secrets from your friend!
You're so stupid, Usagi.
Stu... You're so stupid, Usagi.
Stu...
Stu... Stu...
Stu...
That's mean, Naru! You didn't have to go that far!
I'm an only child. Besides, we have different surnames.
That's true. But didn't you just call Rui your sister?
Well, Rui's mother has been a good customer at our store for a long time.
So, we've been playing together since we were little.
She's only a year older than me, but she's been like a big sister to me.
Oh, so that's why.
Wow, he's gorgeous!
Oh my god, you're right!
I heard that he's a successful businessman.
Do you know him?
He's supposed to be the president of a company Do you know him?
He's supposed to be the president of a company
that was established around here recently.
That was established around here recently. Wow!
Wow!
He's so handsome!
Please don't enter the court without permission!
Use your weight more when you hit the ball!
What?!
Your racket, please.
Here... Your racket, please.
Here...
Okay, try now!
Rui!
A fly could land on a serve like that.
Who are you?
Masato Sanjoin, just an eccentric coach.
I'm sorry.
My loyal monster, possess this racket,
bring Rui Saionji's energy to its peak level and steal it!
Just think of putting your weight behind the ball.
Yes, Sir.
Someone come receive her serve!
Me, me! I'll do it!
When did he get in there?!
First come, first serve!
Miss Saionji, I'm ready any time you are!
Amazing!
Did you see that?! It's amazing!
Thank you so much...
The more you use that racket,
the more your energy will grow.
Oh, shoot!
It feels good.
She's so cool!
Something's not right with Rui.

Code name 0091. This is Luna.
My secret password is The rabbit on the moon makes rice cakes.
Please respond.
The moon rice cakes are sticky.
When I grilled them, they puffed up.
I have found out who the enemy is.
What? Really?
Of course!
Right.
The name of the enemy organization is the Dark Kingdom. Right.
The name of the enemy organization is the Dark Kingdom.
They seem to be after human energy for some reason.
Human energy?
Hikawa Shrine
Dark Kingdom...
We have to brace ourselves to get these guys.
Let's go after them and crush them with one blow!
The way we are now, we aren't capable of that yet.
Exactly! Right now, you need to study more and make yourselves more fit.
I know! How about playing tennis to make ourselves more fit?!
There's this super-cool coach named Mr. Masato Sanjoin.
I see. So, you're going to give up on Tuxedo Mask?
I didn't think about it like that.
That is a problem...
I'm glad I have Ami and Rei.
If Usagi was all I had,
the Dark Kingdom would have stolen all of mankind's energy by now.
What?!
Maybe it's some kind of mistake that Usagi is a member of our group. What?!
Maybe it's some kind of mistake that Usagi is a member of our group.
What's with you?! What's with you?! What's with you?!
Both of you, you're going too far.
Ami! Ami, you're all I've got!
You're the only one who understands me!
So, why don't the two of us play tennis?
Oh, but I have cram school. Sorry.
Knew it!
Miss Saionji...
What's wrong? If it's about the racket, I already gave you another one.
Let's keep going.
Yes...
Rui, you weren't like this before.
Jewelry
I'm sorry for the short notice.
That's okay, I don't mind.
You have something on your mind?
Well, I don't know what to say. I'm just worried about Rui.
Now, she misuses tennis equipment and things.
She never did things like that before.
It's like she's a totally different person.
Maybe she's just tense because the important tournament's coming up.
That's what I thought at first, but that's not it.
I wonder what's happened to her?
Rui, did something happen?
If there's anything I can help you with, just let me know.
This is none of your business. If there's anything I can help you with, just let me know.
This is none of your business.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why Rui would act like that.
I think maybe something terrible has happened to her,
but she won't say anything to me.
I see.
Hey, Naru. Why don't we investigate what happened?
I will help you!
Usagi...
Cheer up!
Is this the tennis school Rui goes to?
Yeah. She practices here after school.
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing! What's wrong?
Oh, nothing!
I have a bad feeling about this.
This couldn't be the work of a monster, could it?
Oh, but if I do a good job here,
I can get back at Luna and Rei.
Usagi...
Hey, are you all right?
What a ball!
What's wrong? You're both pros!
You should be able to hit this!
Please give us a break!
Okay, here comes the next one!
Stop!
Out of my way!
No! Please stop acting like this, Rui! Out of my way!
No! Please stop acting like this, Rui!
Get out of my way, Naru!
No!
Naru is worried about you! No!
Naru is worried about you!
Move!
Move!
The energy level is at its peak. Go, Tesnie!
Your energy is mine now!
It was a monster after all! Okay!
It's time to show them what you've got, Usagi!
Moon Prism Power Makeup!
A monster can never aim for the ace!
Misusing tennis for evil deeds...
I bet even Navratilova is crying now!
I'm the sailor warrior of love and justice,
Sailor Moon!
In the name of the moon, I will punish you!
Impudent girl!
What is this?!
This is so sad!
It's so high!
I should have come here with everybody!
You look good out there!
Who's there?!
Tuxedo Mask!
If you interfere with me, you will end up like her!
It looks fun. Why don't you try it?
You fool. Then you can find out for yourself if it's really fun!
You're so cool, Tuxedo Mask!
He did it! Oh?
Thank you so much!
Don't let your guard down!
Okay! Don't let your guard down!
Okay!
Why you...
Watch out!
Yes! Watch out!
Yes!
I never thought I'd get to fight with Tuxedo Mask.
I'm so happy!
Take this!
There! There! There! There!
And this and this and this!
What is this?! Hey, stop it! And this and this and this!
What are you going to do if it hits me?! And this and this and this!
What are you going to do if it hits me?!
We'll finish her now!
Okay. We'll finish her now!
Okay.
Die!
Now!
Sailor Moon!
Yes! Sailor Moon!
Yes!
Tuxedo Mask, are you all right?!
Do not worry about me! Use your tiara, quickly!
Got it!
Moon Tiara Action!
Sailor Moon!
Not too bad! Sailor Moon!
Not too bad!
I guess it means she's growing up a little.
Oh, he's not there!
I wonder if Tuxedo Mask is all right?
Juban Municipal Junior High School
Rui said she doesn't remember anything she did.
Well, at least she's doing fine now, so it's good, right?
Yeah, that's true.
Naru, do you want to play a little?
Sure, I guess if it's just a little.
Go easy on me, okay?
Oh, I can't do that!
Naru, you can serve first!
Okay, then I'll give you my lethal magic serve!
I'll bet it'd be fun to play tennis with Tuxedo Mask.
Sorry, Usagi!
Usagi, please wake up!
