As our heroes continue their journey,
the future looks sunny and bright.
Uh-oh.
Pika?
- Huh? -A storm?
Let's get out of this.
Where can we go? We're in the middle of nowhere.
-Huh? -What's that?
I don't like the looks of it.
Well, this is no time to be picky.
Pika.
- -Pi.
Hello! Sorry for barging in!
Is anybody here?
-It looks like some kind of theater. -Yeah.
Hey, since nobody's around, we might as well stay till the rain stops.
-Uh-huh. -Pikachu.
Huh?
Where'd that other Pikachu come from?
Pika. Pi, pi.
How cute.
Hi, there.
Ooh.
What is this? What's wrong with it?
-What's your problem? -That Pikachu doesn't look right.
- Huh? -Pikachu.
-Could be a new kind of Pikachu. -A new kind?
All right. Then I'll just have to capture it.
Pikachu, thunder shock!
Pikachu!
Go, Poke Ball!
Hey! Huh?
Hey, Ash, that guy is dressed just like you.
Hmm. Except it's a girl.
-How can you tell? -Men's intuition.
-Huh? -Who are you?
-Tell me who you are. -I'm Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town.
Duplica, from the House of Imitay.
Imitay? Like imitate? Is that why you look just like me?
That's right.
You're right, Brock. She is a girl.
Hmm, but she may be a little young for me.
You're sad.
Aw. It still hasn't gotten over that old habit.
Ditto.
Ditto. A transform Pokemon.
It is able to rearrange the cells of its body and assume any form.
Its only attack is transform.
- -Squishy.
And Ditto can make itself look just like anything.
Hmm. Yeah, but it's face stayed the same.
When it transforms, shouldn't it be able to change completely?
Yeah, it still can't change its face.
But it's the only Pokemon that can transform like that, right?
Or are there others?
Nope. Ditto's one of a kind.
A transforming Pokemon.
It's only attack is to copy other Pokemon. That's all it does.
Isn't that enough?
Yeah, but you can't have the fun of teaching it different attacks.
That is kind of boring.
You think that's boring? Ha!
Well, that's what everyone says who doesn't understand Ditto's real power.
-Its real power? -Let's have a little match.
Then you'll understand, Ashy-boy.
Ashy-boy?
Ditto's power. Let's just see.
Mm-hm.
I chose to use my Ditto, of course.
You choose what you want.
Bulbasaur, I choose you!
Bulbasaur.
Go, little Ditto. Transform!
Ditto!
-Bulbasaur. -Bulba.
You'll have to be better than that.
Uh-uh-uh. You haven't seen the best part yet.
I'll show her.
Bulbasaur. Razor leaf.
Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur.
Ditto. Vine whip.
Bulbasaur.
Bulbasaur.
- -It can imitate attacks, too?
All right. Ditto, restrain Bulbasaur.
-Ah! -No!
Have you had enough yet, Ashy-boy?
-Bulbasaur. -Oh!
All right, I understand. I give up.
Ah!
-Ditto. - Ah!
But how... How could the real thing lose?
Wow. What are all these clothes for?
Don't worry. I'll take good care of it.
My name is Jenny. You're under arrest for Pokemon poaching.
Great imitations.
Very good, but she doesn't capture the more adult charm
of the real Joy and Jenny.
With all these costumes, I can imitate just about anybody.
Watch.
- -She's me.
Don't be so down, Ash. That Ditto's powers are unbeatable.
Pika, pika!
Better than the real Pokemon.
I just can't believe I lost the match to a great big fake.
Oh, Ash, don't think of it as a fake.
Ditto was battling you as real Bulbasaur.
I'm even more impressed by how much knowledge Duplica has.
-Knowledge? -Well, think about it.
Bulbasaur!
Why do you think Duplica had Ditto use vine whip
instead of razor leaf against your Bulbasaur?
Duplica must know all Bulbasaur's potential attacks.
She can order Ditto to use the strongest attack possible,
according to whatever Pokemon form it takes.
That's right.
I guess that means Duplica must know every attack of every Pokemon there is.
You must have studied a lot, Duplica,
to be able to battle in any situation like that.
Oh, stop it, Brock. You're making me blush.
-Pika. - Ditto.
I get it. It's more than just imitation.
It looks like you've got another rival, Ash.
Duplica would make a great Pokemon master.
-No way. -Huh?
I just want to become the greatest Ditto master.
A Ditto master?
You got it. And I want to be a big star.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm the amazing Duplica,
-and this is my assistant, Ditto. -Ditto!
And now for my first imitation, my impression of...
A Gloom.
Now that we have your attention, I'd like to do some of my favorites.
You see, I started this Imitay House because I like to imitate Pokemon.
This place is so flat and boring, but people pass by here all the time.
I thought maybe when they stop here for a rest, I could entertain them.
Now it's time for my assistant Ditto.
Will the Machoke in the front row please come up onto the stage?
Machoke.
-Okay, Ditto, transform. -Ditto.
-Machoke. -Hey.
-That face. -It's all wrong.
- What's going on? - It shouldn't look like that.
The only trouble is Ditto hasn't been able to fix this weird problem
that keeps its face from transforming the right way.
Thank you very much, Machoke, for being a good sport.
Now how about this Voltorb? Would you mind coming up to the stage?
-Voltorb. -Okay, Ditto.
Transform!
Voltorb.
It's still got that dumb face.
That's so... You can tell them apart!
What a fake! It can't transform at all.
Ditto!
And that's what happens.
When people watch Ditto,
they don't want to see an imperfect transformation.
This little one is trying its hardest to master transform perfectly,
but its face stays the same.
Ditto.
-I guess being a Ditto trainer's tough. - Huh?
That was a touching story.
What? Who are you?
Prepare for trouble.
Make it double.
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above...
-Jessie. -James.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Meowth. That's right. Let's give them a hand.
Okay. Show's over. Time to go back home.
Quiet, young twerp. You'll be happy to know
we're not interested in your Pikachu today.
We're here for...
The Ditto.
-Ditto! -Stop!
Time for action, Weezing.
Weezing.
Oh, no, my Ditto's gone!
Team Rocket. What are they up to this time?
Cute little Ditto. Our little Ditto.
Why didn't we think of this before? Now we're unstoppable.
Right. Now we can take our names off the loser list
and put them in the winning column.
And the boss will make me top cat again.
All right, little Ditto, we have a little favor to ask you.
Ditto?
Transform into this.
Won't you, please? Please? Pretty please?
Become Dratini, the Pokemon we've never been able to capture.
It would make a handsome gift for the boss.
Sir, we've finally captured Dratini, that legendary Pokemon.
Yes. Well done.
I will reward you lavishly for your hard work.
From now on, you will take my place as the head of Team Rocket.
Your wish is my command.
Let's do it. Let's make it change right this second, Jessie.
-What's the hurry? -Hmm?
Since Ditto is ours for the moment,
let's have some fun before we hand it over to the boss.
-Some fun? -Ditto.
What would the person in this picture look like if he were an adult?
-Ditto? -Transform and show me.
Whose picture is that? Let me see.
-No way. This is personal. James, stop it. -Let me see.
Let's see.
Ooh! Jessie has a boyfriend?
He was my first true love.
-First love? -Show me?
Ditto.
-Huh? -
Your first love sure has an interesting face.
Especially if you're interested in Ditto.
That wasn't funny.
Is that your idea of a transformation?
-Ditto. -Huh?
Now do as I say!
Transform into this.
-Ditto. -
I'm beginning to see a flaw in this plan.
How dare you insult us like this!
I'm warning you, you'd better transform perfectly this time
or I'll transform you into jelly.
Ditto.
Don't worry, Duplica. Cheer up.
We'll all help you find Ditto.
We've already sent Pidgeotto and Zubat out on surveillance.
There you go. See?
Yeah. Thanks, you guys.
Hey, Ash. What's on your mind?
Well, it's just Ditto's transform.
You can't forget how important the trainer's ability is too.
It's not the Pokemon but the trainer who decides
which attack to use in a battle, right?
And that means that if you raise a Ditto,
its progress and power are connected directly to your own.
Yeah. I think you're definitely right about that, Ash.
Sounds like you've been studying, Ash.
-Pika, pika? -
-Pikachu, did they see Ditto anywhere? -Pika!
-Let's go save Ditto. -Yeah.
- Wait. - Huh?
I think I have an idea.
What's wrong with you? Why can't you get it right?
I don't have a goofy face like that.
Get it right this time, Ditto, or you'll regret it.
-That's right. - Ditto. Ditto.
-Oh! -Success.
You really can do it if you try. Great job, Ditto.
Now how about a Dratini?
-Sorry, Meowth. - Huh?
-Hey! - Huh?
Prepare for trouble.
And make it double double.
Quit imitating us.
To protect the world from devastation...
To ignite all peoples within our nation...
This is insulting.
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above...
-Ash. -Misty.
And Brock.
Duplica. That's right.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight all of us.
Pika, pika.
That was great to do the whole thing.
Now I know why they like saying all that dumb stuff so much. It's fun.
Hey, I know, maybe we should all become actors.
-Pika, pika. -
Team Rocket is not something to be made fun of,
but if you're going to imitate us, at least do it right.
To unite all peoples within our nation. Not ignite.
We'll be taking Ditto back now.
No way.
No way.
Hey, I can't tell which one is which.
But I thought that Ditto couldn't imitate faces.
That's true, but Ditto was finally perfected
under the expert care and training of Team Rocket.
- Oh, thank you. - Huh?
I've tried everything I could think of to get Ditto to imitate faces.
Now Ditto can finally become the kind of Pokemon
I always knew it could be.
Duplica.
-That's beautiful. -Yeah.
-That's so beautiful I can't stand it. - Neither can I.
Hey, you guys, why don't we just solve this without a big battle?
All right. We'll do it your way this time.
We'll just give you Ditto.
Hey. What are you doing?
We'll be on our way now.
-Goodbye, everyone. -Good luck with Ditto.
-Hold it right there! -
Hey, Duplica, what are you doing?
-This isn't Ditto. -Huh?
Hey, let me go, will you? Ah!
Impossible. How could you tell?
It was a perfect transformation.
I wouldn't be much of a trainer
if I couldn't see through that transformation, would I, Ditto?
Dimwits! How'd you manage to mess this one up?
You are in no position to complain.
It's time for plan B.
Stop! You can't do this!
Quiet, all of you! We're going to win after all.
Ditto, transform now!
Ditto!
That's great.
I didn't know Ditto could transform into things like that.
-Pikachu. -Pikachu!
Pikachu, aim!
Ditto, fire!
Fire!
Chu!
Ah!
Jessie, we lose everything.
Even all our hot air.
Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again!
-Ditto. -That was great.
You've learned how to completely transform.
Ditto, would you please transform into a Pikachu?
Ditto.
-Pikachu. -Pi?
-Pika. -Pika.
That's amazing. Ditto transforms perfectly.
Ha. I can hardly believe it.
Team Rocket was actually good for something.
Yeah, and the way Ditto transforms into objects is great.
You're just as real as the real thing.
Hey, Ditto, great job.
-Pika? -Pika.
But now I can't tell which one's my Pikachu.
Then I guess you need to keep training, Ashy-boy.
-Right, Ditto? -Ditto.
Ah.
Pikachu.
Ditto. Ditto.
There. The Imitay House is reopened.
Congratulations.
- You did it, Duplica. -Thanks for everything.
Come back and see us anytime, okay?
Good luck! And take of yourself, Ditto master!
Imagine, the strength of all the Pokemon in one.
Maybe I'll capture a Ditto for myself someday.
Our heroes helped bring the sunshine
back into a fellow trainer's Life.
Who knows what rewards and adventures await them beyond the rainbow?
- Hey! What are you doing? - Hold still.
Stop it. Let me go! Cut it out, will you? Ow! Quit it!
Will you stop it, Meowth?
The only way we can get out of this mess
is to dress you up like a Dratini and present you to the boss.
Pea brains. This won't work.
Take that! And that!
- How dare you touch my face! - Let go of me!
You guys up for the Pokerap?
