Ash and his friends are in for a surprise
at this small-town Pokemon Center.
-Is your name Ash? -Yeah.
I have a message for you.
-For me? -Pika. Pika.
Greetings, Ash. It's Professor Oak.
Give me a call when you get a chance!
It's from Professor Oak.
I guess it's been awhile since you talked him, Ash.
-Why don't you give him a buzz? - Okay, let's see.
Professor. I hope he's around.
Hi, Professor Oak. It's Ash!
Hello there, Ash!
I suppose my message finally found its way to you!
-Yeah. -How is everyone? Say...
-Pikachu sure is looking well. -Pikachu!
-I'm fine, too. -I'm glad to hear it!
Well, they say no news is good news,
uh, but I do wish you'd let me know how things are going now and then.
I know. We've been kind of busy. Uh...
Muk. Muk. Muk.
Come on. Cut that out!
My Muk seems to be doing okay.
Taking care of it hasn't been so easy!
Will you behave?
I hope the next Pokemon you send will be easier to manage!
I hope so, too, Professor, but I haven't caught any new ones.
That's right.
Well, make sure the next ones aren't so mucky!
-Muk. -
I almost forgot.
Have you heard about the new Pokedex upgrade?
Pokedex upgrade? No, I haven't!
Well, now you can get details on all the latest Pokemon discoveries.
Wow! How can I get it?
Just put your Pokedex into that slot and I'll do it.
Once upgraded, your Pokedex will have an updated database and even a new voice!
All right! I'm putting it in right now!
Okay. It's all done.
Gee, thanks!
Okay, no time to lose.
Go capture more Pokemon and collect some new badges too!
Professor... we're on our way right now!
Where to next?
We could head to Cinnabar Island and the Cinnabar Gym.
The Cinnabar Gym.
- -Pika.
Hey, Brock, when do you think that eggs going to hatch?
Who knows?
-Hey, look what I found. - Huh?
Are you sure it's all right to just take that?
Maybe I should have given this Pokemon egg to Joy.
-No way! -Huh?
I'll raise this one for you.
And I've been keeping it close to me every night so it'll stay nice and warm.
What? You mean you sleep with that egg?
It's the only way it'll hatch. What else can I do?
So, Brock, what kind of Pokemon's going to hatch out of that thing anyway?
To tell you the truth, Ash, I don't know.
You mean it might even turn out to be a Tentacruel?
It could be, Misty.
I'd just love a Tentacruel!
Oh! But it could it even be an Aerodactyl?
That's a possibility, too.
-Maybe it won't be. -I'd like it to be a Golem!
Oh, imagine if it were a lovely Lapras.
I can't wait to see what kind of Pokemon hatches, no matter what it is.
Did you hear that? They're hatching a new Pokemon!
-I think he said a Dragonair. -No, no. He said an Aerodactyl!
Whatever it is, we gotta get our hands on that egg.
This could be the chance we been waiting for.
Imagine when the boss hears we've captured a Pokemon!
He'll be shocked.
Don't forget.
We haven't even succeeded in capturing that one little Pikachu from those kids!
We have a proud tradition of failure to uphold!
- Then you fail! -And we'll win!
What? Hey, what's up? Hey, let me in! Oh, come on!
I can break tradition!
-So, how far to cinnabar island? - Hmm.
-It looks pretty far. - Huh?
Hello, everybody! Good day!
I don't believe my eyes!
We kick up our legs so you will buy our eggs!
What kind of Pokemon eggs are they? Ah.
Wait and find out when they hatch!
Won't you buy some? Please! Please! Please!
We don't need any Pokemon eggs'cause we already have one of our own.
-Yeah. -Ah!
Let me see it. Show me!
Okay, okay.
Here. Like it?
-Oh! It's pretty! Lovely! -Beautiful!
One, two...
Which one is ours?
They aren't egg sellers!
-Prepare for trouble! -Make it double!
-To protect the world from devastation! -To unite all peoples within our nation!
-To denounce the evils of truth and love! -To extend our reach to the stars above!
-Jessie! -James!
- Is that it? - Huh?
Hmm. Let's see.
-Hey! You didn't let us finish! -Yeah, that's right!
And we didn't even get to the best part.
Ah. Is this it? Huh? Ah.
-Ah. Isn't this it? -Huh?
- Huh? -
Is this what you're looking for?
That's it! Meowths got our egg!
-It was... -Your egg.
Let's beat it!
Come back, you thieves!
- Eh, we did it! - A great success!
It was because I made such a cute egg salesgirl.
Yeah, maybe.
So shall we cook it over easy?
Or maybe we can scramble it? Or I know!
-We can make a little fried rice! -
You're not cooking it because I'm hatching it.
-But how will you do that? -Very simple.
I will warm it with my body.
-Ah... - Huh?
-Still holding that egg? -Of course I am.
If I put it down my beautiful egg, it'll cool off, and it won't hatch!
Hmm?
Now, my little eggy-weggy, while you and I share a nice hot soak,
I'm going to tell you a bath time story.
Hmm. Once upon a time...
Ah, you're boiling it!
I like mine soft boiled.
Huh? Boiled? I told you I'm going to hatch it not eat it!
Good night, little egg. Time for us to go sleepy!
-I never realized Meowth could be so... -Revolting.
Hey! Ah.
Look, it's another one!
If we just follow these eggs, they'll lead us all the way to Team Rocket!
Wow, they're pretty dumb, aren't they? Leaving us a trail of broken eggs.
If they're so dumb, how come they're the ones who have the egg?
I guess you have a point there.
Pika! Pika! Pika!
They must be in there!
Rise and shine, my little eggy-poo!
Meowth's going to make you nice and shiny because we got a lot of incubating to do.
Here!
-What's that? -Your scrambled eggs!
-I told you to lay off the e-g-g-s! -Ah.
How can you be so insensitive, you numbskull?
-That's definitely the egg. -Right, now's our chance.
Go, Pidgeotto!
-Go, Geodude! -Geodude!
Staryu, I choose you!
-Psy-ay-ay! -No, not you!
-What? -What's going on?
- -Ah. Huh?
Good work, Pidgeotto!
Hey, give me back my egg!
That's funny. And all along, I thought this was our egg.
Go get them and my egg!
-Go, Arbok! -Weezing, go!
-Weezing! -Charm!
Careful, Ash, the egg!
-Charm! -Argh!
Huh?
-The egg! -Nyah! Nyah!
Geodude! Tackle attack!
-I got it! -I've got it!
Hey, Staryu! Airborne tackle! Now!
Huh? Oh!
-Got it! -Got it! Ooh!
Yeah! Ah!
Can't see.
Pidgeotto, Gust attack! Blow this gas away!
Quick, somebody catch it! The eggs going to break!
I missed it! Huh?
Pika!
-Pikachu. -Pikachu!
-You did it, Pikachu! -Nice catch, Pikachu!
-Kachu! -Huh?
What's wrong, Ash?
It feels like there's something moving inside!
-Huh? -Pika...
-It's starting to crack! -Yeah, it's about to hatch!
Pika!
Hey! Oh, let me see!
Ah!
It hatched! It hatched! Oh, how cute, heh!
Oh, hello to you too!
Oh, we're so lucky!
We are!
If Pikachu hadn't caught it...
-That precious little Pokemon might have...
-We have a battle to finish! -I almost forgot!
- Let's get them! -Pikachu, Thunderbolt attack!
Pikachu!
-See you! -Later!
Bye!
My egg!
Where am I? Hi!
-It's so cute! -It sure is, Misty.
-But what kind of Pokemon is it? -Ah, good question.
Hey, now that Dexter's been upgraded, he'll know the answer!
Togepi, an egg Pokemon.
Specific information about this Pokemon is still unavailable.
So, Togepi is your name. You even sound cute!
-Pika! -
You think so too, don't you, Pikachu?
Pikachu!
Of course it's cute. All newborns are cute.
That's right!
So now which one of us gets to keep Togepi?
I think I should. I'm the one who incubated the egg.
But I was the one who found it in the first place.
I just let you watch it for a while!
I mothered it!
-Well... -Huh?
I think I should keep Togepi because it likes me best, right, Togepi?
It's obvious. Togepi has made the right choice.
No fair! I found it, so it's mine!
Well, maybe you should have taken better care of it!
-But you never took care of it! -That's right! I took care of it!
Oh, yeah? I took care of it more than all of you put together!
That's right. You never saw how much Meowth cared for that egg.
They were together when they ate. They were together when they slept.
They even bathed together. It was touching!
Please, James. Just hearing it brings tears to my eyes.
I never knew you were so sensitive.
Save your pity. All I want from you is my Togepi!
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
Team rocket's acting almost human.
All right! The only way to decide this is with a Pokemon battle!
A Pokemon battle?
That's right. We'll have a tournament, and whoever wins gets to keep Togepi.
-Are you in, or are you out? -
Count me in!
-So we'll have a six-way tournament. -Right!
-Wait a minute! - Huh?
These two have no right to participate!
-Hey! -What do you mean?
I hereby testify that neither of you performed a single act to assist Togepi.
I can't believe you're being so selfish!
What about Team Rocket?
Then just the four of us will battle!
Sounds good to me.
Let's make it a sudden death battle by using just one Pokemon each.
- Okay! - Let's do it!
Fine with me!
Now, let's see. Which Pokemon should I use?
I forgot! I don't have any Pokemon to battle with!
Hey, guys, could I borrow one of your Pokemon?
Not a chance.
Agh! What am I going to do now? Huh?
Uh. Oh, yeah, I forgot! I am a Pokemon! I can battle for myself!
First up is Brock versus Meowth.
-Go, Onyx! -Go, Meowth!
Argh!
Meowth! Give them your Scratch attack! Unh. Okay! Here goes!
-Being your own trainer must be tough. -Must be.
Meowth!
Meowth isn't doing all that badly.
I didn't know Meowth was so spunky.
Your scratch attack can't do anything against Onyx's hard stone body.
Onyx! Rock Throw now!
- -Ah!
What's wrong, Meowth? Hang in there!
But Meowths scratch and bite attacks
aren't any good against that giant rock Pokemon!
- - Pika, pika, pika!
I'll do it for Togepi! Meowth refuses to lose!
Huh? That's it!
Onyx is weak against water!
What do you say, Meowth? Do you surrender?
Meowth never says die!
The absolute victory drench with water attack!
Fury swipes attack!
Onyx! Are you okay?
Hey, throwing water is cheating!
I am merely a parent fighting for its child!
And I'm going to win this tournament!
-Well, well... -Meowth won.
Next up is Ash and Misty.
-Our first battle since Cerulean Gym! -This time I'm going to beat you!
Bulbasaur, I choose you!
Bulbasaur!
Ah, yes, just as I expected. You chose Bulbasaur!
-So I'll choose... -Psy-ay!
Quick! Get back in the ball!
You're not allowed to call your Pokemon back!
Ugh, he's right.
Okay, aim for Psyducks head, Bulbasaur!
Its head? Yeah, like I'm that dense!
-Bulbasaur, go lick Psyduck on the head! -Bulbasaur!
No, Bulbasaur! You'll never lick Psyduck if you lick it.
Good! Now, use the Tickle attack!
Psy-ay-ay! Psy-ay-ay! Psy-ay-ay!
Psy-ay-ay! Psy-ay-ay! Psy-ay-ay!
The battle's over. Ash and Bulbasaur win!
All right, nice work! We did it!
-We did it! -Oh, no! No! No! No!
The winner will get Togepi!
- All right! I choose Pikachu! - Pika!
In that case, I choose Meowth! Ready!
Pi!
Little Togepi.
I can still remember when you were just an egg,
and all we went through together.
For your sake, Togepi, I, Meowth, will win you back!
All right! Victory will be mine!
Use your Fury Swipes attack! Right!
Pika...
- - Chu!
I lost so fast, I'm a little shocked!
-The winner! -We did it!
-I knew Meowth would lose. -The heroes always get the breaks.
We did it!
Little Togepi...
I hope you'll be very happy with your new trainer.
Good-bye now.
Togepi, you're mine now!
Uh, what's wrong?
Togepi, hey... It's no good.
I told you, but you didn't want to believe me.
Look, it doesn't want to go to anyone else but me now.
Huh?
Hey, what's going on here?
Togepi is imprinted with the image of the first thing it sees
after it hatches, thinking this is its mother.
Yeah, that explains it!
When it hatched, Misty was the first thing it saw!
I knew it!
Togepi likes me, because it thinks I'm its mother!
Right, Togepi?
I'll love you just like a mother would.
You'll help me take care of Togepi, won't you, Pikachu?
-Pikachu! -Uh-huh.
Well, with Misty as its new trainer,
it seems like Togepi is the real winner, don't you think?
-Whoa! Whoa! -
Yeah!
