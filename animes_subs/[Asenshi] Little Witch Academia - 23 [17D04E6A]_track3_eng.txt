There was a bit of a commotion in town and we got separated.
Calm down. If you would, please tell me what happened in more detail.
Calm down. Could you tell me what happened is more detail?
I've had a dream ever since I was a child.
It was to become a witch who could make everyone smile.
I had no doubt it would come true.
But when it came to the magic, I faced nothing but failures.
Even if I fail and fail again, I still want to give people a fun and exciting time.
No matter how much I may fail, I want to entertain and give people an exciting time.
That feeling alone kept me going.
As I kept my belief, a staff of seven stars appeared before me.
If I were able to revive the seven Words with that staff,
If I were able to revive the seven Words with that staff,
I had no doubt that it was fantastic magic able to bring joy to their hearts.
Following Professor Woodward's guidance, I searched for the seven Words.
Nothing went wrong all the way through reviving the sixth Word.
However, the final Word just wouldn't appear.
I want to make everyone smile even more!
That will definitely allow me to revive the seventh!
A believing heart is your magic!
How would you like to show it to an even bigger audience?
But at some point, their responses began to change.
You need to come up with some magic that'll up the excitement!
You need to create an even more exciting magic.
Though it's still only experimental.
It converts the audience's dreaming energy into magic.
Chariot will then be able to use even greater magic, in turn giving people even bigger dreams to see.
Chariot will be able to use even greater magic, in turn giving people even bigger dreams to see.
Power like that is unprecedented.
With that amount, the magic world will once more be reinvigorated.
There's no need to be concerned over a few trifling sacrifices if you look at what you get for them.
I didn't? Well, it wasn't worth mentioning.
What happens to the people it absorbs?
Nothing much. They simply lose a certain ability.
What's the problem with normal people losing an ability they'd normally never even use?
What's the problem with normal people losing an ability they'd normally never even use?
I suppose there might be an issue if a child from a magic lineage was there watching,
but why would any self-respecting witch allow them to see a heretic like you?
I never would've used it if I had known.
And yet!
What the hell are you even thinking, wasting your time on these ridiculous shows?!
What the hell are you thinking devoting all your time to these ridiculous shows?!
What is a Shiny Rod supposed to be?! Don't give it such a strange name.
Are you telling me the Claimh Solais chose you just for this?
This utter absurdity?!
Why were you chosen...
After that, I stopped using Dream Fuel Spirit.
People always want to see something new, something bigger...
Don't you have any new magic?
More fun magic!
Crap, amnesia magic!
There was no record of a student by the name of Ursula Callistis attending this school.
How can anything possibly be more important than worrying about Akko right now?!
I'm more disappointed in your present actions than what you did in the past.
Then we'll look around the terminal.
Got it, let's go.
I swear, if Akko's not coming back, she'd better hope I don't find her.
I swear, if Akko doesn't come back she'd better hope I don't find her.
She's not on this side either. Maybe she's not in the area.
We should check out the plaza just in case.
She'd never thank about anything that difficult.
Don't worry. She'll come back shouting she's hungry like she always does.
Come to think of it, there's something I wanted to show you.
At that point, those from the world of magic had already started looking down on her.
At that point, those from the magic world already looked down on her.
I could only collect these cards in secret.
Countless nights, I was dreaming of seeing Chariot's show.
Countless nights I could only dream of seeing Chariot's show.
But one day, my mother arranged for me to see one overseas where nobody would notice.
There was a time when Diana became completely unable to use magic.
So does that mean that when you became unable to use magic...
Does that mean when you became unable to use magic...
Even though your ability was sucked up too, you worked hard to become an amazing witch.
I was also charmed by Shiny Chariot's magic.
Unfortunately, the more I learned of magic, the more aware I became of the expectations placed on me,
and the further my heart grew away from Chariot.
Telling myself I must become an adult, I closed the lid.
When we first met, I couldn't stand you.
You went around telling everyone you loved Chariot, and your grades and magic couldn't be worse.
You always acted without thinking and caused trouble for everyone.
Your magic contained a mysterious charm.
I wanted to avoid the reality of you being far closer to Chariot than I was.
Of course! I'll never quite until I become a splendid witch!
I promise. I'm sorry I made you worry.
Come in, you kids must all be freezing.
Come in, you all must be freezing.
No, you were certainly crying.
What is it?
I absorbed it all from around the country.
I couldn't have gotten here without you.
This is only complete thanks to the Dream Fuel Spirit experiments you did.
I figured you deserved some gratitude.
I swear that I will stop you.
Akko disappeared?
There was a bit of a commotion in town, and then we got separated.
Still, she's way too late!
A commotion, you say...
We spent a lot of time looking for her after that...
Then we checked whether she'd already come back, but she's not here either.
What should we do?
Do you think something happened to her?
Calm down. Could you please tell me what happened in more detail?
I understand. Our first course of action should be informing Professor Ursula.
Yeah, probably.
I'll go tell her now.
Allow me to go. Akko may come back at any time.
Please wait for her in your room.
Okay. Thanks, Diana.
Take action!
Take action!
Raise your hands!

I've had a dream ever since I was a child.
It was to become a witch who could make everyone smile.
I had no doubt it would come true.
But when it came to the actual magic, I stumbled from one blunder to the next.
You've gotta believe. A believing heart is magic.
No matter how much I may fail, I still want to give people a fun and exciting time.
It was that feeling that kept me going.
And then, as I stayed true to my belief, a staff of seven stars appeared before me.
If I could revive the seven Words with that staff,
I would obtain the world reconstruction magic, Grand Triskelion.
I had no doubt it was a fantastic magic, able to bring joy to people's hearts!
Following Professor Woodward's guidance, I searched for the seven Words.
Nothing went wrong all the way through reviving the sixth Word.
However, the final Word just wouldn't appear.
I want to make everyone smile even more!
That will definitely allow me to revive the seventh!
A believing heart is your magic!
That's some wonderful magic.
How do you like the idea of showing it to an even bigger audience?
Bringing smiles to more and more people!
I started traveling the world.
But with time, their responses began to change.
You need to invent some magic that'll up the excitement!
It's been quite the while, Chariot.
Croix!
I want to live up to their expectations and show them magic like they've never seen before.
What do you think about trying out the magic I'm currently researching?
Though it's still at an experimental stage.
What kind of magic?
Dream Fuel Spirit.
It turns the audience's dreaming energy into magic.
Chariot will then be able to use still greater magic, in turn giving people even bigger dreams to see.
Dream Fuel Spirit raised my magic to a new level.
It was a huge success! Did you see all their smiles?
Yes, that was marvelous.
This power is incomparable.
Huh?
With this much, the magic world will once more be reinvigorated.
What?
In exchange for that, there's no need to be concerned over a few trifling sacrifices.
Sacrifices?
Dream Fuel Spirit absorbs the dreaming energy of those it's used on, converting it into magic.
You never... said anything about that.
I didn't? Well, it wasn't even worth mentioning.
Y-You can't be...
What happens to the people you absorb from?
Nothing much. They merely lose a certain ability.
What's the problem with normal people losing an ability they'd ordinarily never even use?
Well, I guess there might be an issue if a child from a magic lineage was sitting in the audience,
but why would any self-respecting witch allow them to see a heretic like you?
Why, Croix?
If I had known that, I never would have used it!
I never asked for that kind of power.
You never asked for power?
Enough with your naivete!
This is exactly why you still haven't gotten the final Word!
You have a responsibility as the chosen one. A duty to obtain the world reconstruction magic!
And yet!
What the hell are you thinking, wasting your time on these ridiculous shows?!
Croix...
What is a Shiny Rod supposed to be?! Don't give it such a strange name.
Are you telling me the Claimh Solais chose you just for this?
This utter absurdity?!
Why...
Why were you chosen...
I don't know either.
All I want to do is use magic to make people happy.
That's all I can do...
You don't understand a thing.
Your shows will soon be shunned and forgotten.
Magic will... be forgotten.
I can't take the same path as you. I must go my own way.
Goodbye.
After that, I stopped using Dream Fuel Spirit.
What are you doing?
People are always yearning for something new, something bigger...
Magic will...
Didn't you bring any new magic?
I want more fun magic!
Something more!
Noctu Orfei Aude Fraetor!
Incredible...
Crapamnesia magic!
This is Diana.
I have an urgent message regarding Akko.
Can I help you?
Akko has yet to return from her trip into town.
Do you know anything about that?
Did you not meet Akko in the city?
I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
While we're at it, may we continue our conversation from this afternoon?
I'm a little tied up with other things right now.
Then I'll get right to the point.
There are no records of a student by the name of Ursula Callistis attending this school.
Your real name is Chariot du Nord.
You are Shiny Chariot, correct?
Yes, that's right.
You ran into Akko earlier, didn't you?
Please tell me what happened!
Fine.
Those who saw your show became unable to use magic?
I hurt Akko.
And you didn't chase after her?
Are you saying you left her alone in that condition and returned by yourself?
Professor Ursula!
I can no longer be of help to Akko.
What are you saying?! Now is the time she most needs you by her side!
I'm sorry, but there's something else I must be doing.
How can anything possibly be more important than worrying about Akko right now?!
I understand. That's enough.
We'll find Akko.
I'm more disappointed in what you did today than all that you've done in the past.
Please... take care of Akko.

Akko still hasn't come back?
Yes, she may still be somewhere out in town.
Did you learn anything new?
That can't be...
You're kidding. It's really Chariot's fault that Akko can't fly?
There's no chance Akko could've imagined that.
You don't think she's not planning to come back...
Of course not!
Akko would never leave over something like that...
Y-You're right.
Sorry, I didn't mean it.
But how does Professor Ursula know all that?
I'll tell you in due time.
The most important thing now is to find Akko.
We're going too!
Me too!
Well, then we'll start looking around the terminal.
Understood. I will start my search from the Leyline.
Got it. Let's go!
Akko!
Akko!
I swear, if Akko doesn't come back, she'd better hope I don't find her.
Seriously, Akko's a genius at making people run themselves ragged.
Sucy!
I couldn't find her at the terminal.
She's not on this side either. Maybe she's not in the area.
We should check out the plaza, just in case.
Come on.
I hate this.
I don't want Akko to go away!
I've never even considered the thought that Akko might leave.
What should I do? If Akko never comes back...
It'll be okay.
Akko's an idiot.
She'd never think about anything that difficult.
Yeah...
Don't worry. She'll come back moaning that she's hungry, like she always does.
Akko!
Have you warmed up somewhat?
You must have been freezing. I was shocked to see you sitting out there in the cold.
I asked Professor Ursula about what happened with you and Chariot.
Come to think of it, there was something I wanted to show you.
The Chariot premium card...
I believe you were collecting them as well.
Why do you have this?
Because I used to look up to Shiny Chariot as a child too.
Huh? You looked up to her?
I was infatuated.
At that point, those from the world of magic were already looking down on her.
I couldn't collect these cards but in secret.
Pressure from those around me made me give up on seeing a show myself.
Countless nights, I could only dream of seeing Chariot's show.
But one day, my mother arranged for me to see one overseas, where nobody would notice.
Huh? You went that far to see her?
Yes, to your country.
Then you were at that show too?
It was fantastic.
I can remember that night as clearly as if it were yesterday.
There was a time when Diana became completely unable to use magic.
Does that mean that when you became unable to use magic...
You knew about that?
Yeah, Andrew told me.
He also said you never gave up and worked hard until you got your magic back.
I see.
What happened to us was an unfortunate accident.
But I will not give you my sympathy.
I am the greatest proof that it is possible to regain that lost power.
Of course you are, Diana.
Even though your ability was sucked up too, you worked hard and became an amazing witch.
But here I am, still unable to even fly.
Do you know why I didn't give up?
Because you had to become the Cavendish family head?
That is one part of it, of course.
But as a young girl, that reason alone could not have compelled me to keep going.
I am the same as you.
Huh?
I, too, was charmed by Shiny Chariot's magic.
It was the first time I saw Chariot's magic.
My heart was racing with pure happiness.
I felt the preciousness of magic deep inside me.
Chariot filled me with emotion.
That in itself was my greatest support back then.
Unfortunately, the more I learned of magic and the more aware I became of the expectations placed on me,
the further my heart grew away from Chariot.
I can't continue with these childish dreams.
Telling myself I had to become an adult, I closed the lid.
Even so, the true reason I entered Luna Nova
was because it was the school Chariot went to.
When we first met, I couldn't stand you at all.
Huh?
You went around telling everyone you loved Chariot, and your grades and magic couldn't have been worse.
You always acted without thinking and caused trouble for everyone.
But at the same time, you were able to do things I couldn't.
Your magic had a mysterious charm to it.
I was envious of you.
You were?
Thinking back, the reason I tried to leave Luna Nova might have been to run away from you.
I wanted to avoid facing the reality of you being far closer to Chariot than I was.
Diana...
I will give this to you.
Accept it with the meaning of the card.
A believing heart is your magic.
I believe as well.
I believe in your believing heart.
Your magic is stronger than anyone else's.
Lotte?
I found you, Akko!
WaiLotte?
You won't go anywhere, right?
Huh?
You won't quit school, right?
Lotte...
Of course! I'll never quit, not until I become a splendid witch!
Really?
Really! I'm sorry I made you worry.
Thank you...
You here, Akko?!
Amanda! Constanze and Jasminka too.
Akko says she isn't going anywhere!
See? That's exactly what I told you.
Come in, you kids must be freezing.
Drink up! It's on the house.
Thanks!
Hey, Akko, don't tell me you were crying.
I wasn't crying! The cold just made my eyes
You're full of it. I can still see the tears.
That's not it!
No, you certainly were crying.
Perfect timing.
I was just thinking about how I wanted you to see this.
What is that?
Noir Fuel Spirit.
I harvested it from all around the country.
But I couldn't have done this without you.
It was your Dream Fuel Spirit experiments that helped me complete this.
I figured you deserve some gratitude.
It's time. My plan has entered its final stage.
I won't let you.
I swear I will stop you.
