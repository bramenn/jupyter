I'm surprised you're knockin' back the booze during an emergency like this.
Hey, I know this guy. He's Gryder, a notorious drunk around these parts.
Nice that you're able to afford it.
Meanwhile, we're racing around in the name of justice.
Justice?
That's right.
Justice towards fighting against the returned Oracion Seis.
Justice towards protecting the citizens of Fiore.
Gryder, you got any sense of justice?
Justice, my ass! I don't wanna hear it!
What the hell?!
You think you can get away with pickin' a fight with Fiore soldiers?!
Your teleportation speed is rusty.
Stop this, Doranbolt.
I'm Mest. The traitor, Mest Gryder.
You're still using that name?
Whatever. I need to speak with you.
Follow me.
What's wrong with justice? There was a time when even you...
I abandoned Wendy.
I abandoned all of them.
How is that justice?
There's no need for you to fixate on justice.
Right now, I need your strength.
That's why I'm here.
Lahar...
Come with me, Doranbolt.
I'll apologize if it'll help.
Alright?
I'm not Doranbolt.
My name is Mest. Call me that.
Alright. First, lay off the booze.
Battle Discord!
Jackass! You're no Man!
I'll take care of you later, Octopus Man!
You must be really confident to look away!
Here it comes!
Magic Crunchy-kun!
I can't see anything!
What the hell are you doin'?!
Sorry!
Wait!
He's a tough opponent. We need to beat him with teamwork!
Alright!
Fine!
Cancer, please!
Leave it to me-ebi!
Man!
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
Here it comes! Steel Wall!
Natsu, you moron!
Do you mean to cook and eat me-ebi?!
Uh-oh...
It's my fault?!
Who are you glarin' at?! I'll punch you first!
I wanna cut that hair-ebi!
Don't fight amongst yourselves!
It looks like they just don't get along.
But...
The combos should have good chemistry and their destinations should be on target.
Chemistry, huh?
Come on, already. My feet hurt...
Who goes mountain climbing in heels?
Well, after all, I'm a fairy...
You lost me...
It hurts, it hurts...
Shut up and walk.
What's your problem?! I told you I'm in pain here!
You should worry about me at least a little!
You make a fuss just over that?
You should stop whining and focus on moving ahead.
Give me a break. Acting like she's the leader... Who appointed her?
Did you say something?
Not especially...
What a pain in the ass. Why were they put together?
Somebody is complimenting me again.
I wouldn't be too sure of that...
What do you mean?!
There it is! Lightning Bonus!
Nee-san, are you okay?!
I don't think I am...
Up against my Slot Magic, you're less than worms!
I think I'll bombard you with dizzying changes!
Bastard!
We won't accomplish anything like this! What do we do?
Ain't nothin' to think about! There's only one thing to do!
Kick his ass!
Okay!
Totally hot! A shaggy pool!
Now this is my moment to shine-ebi!
Nobody asked you to do this!
Ebi... It was out of habit...
Never mind teamwork, at this rate...
We're all different!
It can't be helped! Like they say, each to their own taste, right?
Yeah, but I've got fish, you have Darjeeling tea...
It's delicious when you sink your teeth into it, skin and all.
Is that how you're supposed to eat it?
The sour taste spreads through my mouth, along with a subtle sweetness,
and the sensation of the skin!
It's delicious! I can't get enough!
The sensation of the skin?
What's that smell?
As for me, I like this...
Mushrooms sauteed in butter.
Sammy!
Hello, Nii-san. Happy and Carla, too.
You're all silly little brats!
It's comin' again!
Rain...
Rain? I see!
Gate of the Water Bearer, I open thee!
Aquarius!
You called, girl?
And you summoned me again from muddy water...
You looking to get hurt?!
I-I'm sorry...
But don't threaten me! Do something about that machine monster!
Why do you always summon me when I'm on a date?
Out of jealousy?
No...
Fine. I'll take care of this punk nice and quick!
Man!
No fair! I'm gonna hit him first!
Actually, you're going to turn right around!
Totally hot!
Stay outta my way!
You stay outta my way!
Both of you, shut the hell up!
Why is this happening?!
They're not working together at all!
Only a little left...
Say, Nico, I wonder how many more years this tree will live...
Katja-sama! What are you doing here?!
I was looking at this tree.
You can't do that! Don't wander around outside! The situation we're in right now...
I know it very well. And how little time we have left, too.
In that case...
Maybe this tree will remember us... is what I was thinking.
One more thing...
Word is that Fabrizio was found and taken away.
Oh?
Maybe it's my turn next...
If you're scared, you can escape, Nico.
Is it that disagreeable to be paired up with me?
No, but...
If you don't like it, you're free to run to that naked bastard.
I don't dislike you, Gajeel-kun.
But... But... Grey-sama...
On a beautiful, warm day,
Juvia and Grey-sama, drinking tea in a fancy open cafe...
Juvia wishes a tranquil day like this would last forever...
Gimme some tea! Tea, I said! With iron in it!
They've got that inside the shop, so get it from there!
The shop doesn't get much sunlight inside, so the iron is probably all rusty!
It's better to be out here!
Gajeel-kun...
Don't get in Juvia's way.
What's the problem? We're just gonna drink together is all.
Juvia told you... don't get in my way!
Knock it off! You'll rust me out!
That's what it's like...
I don't get you. But it's a pain in the ass...
That's the kind of woman Juvia is.
Are you alright, Wendy?
Yes! I'll do my best.
We'll almost be at our destination once we make it past this mountain pass.
Right!
What the heck is that?
A storm...
I guess the weather in the mountains changes quickly...
What is this?! This is way too powerful!
Yesterday, the weather was... I can't remember.
It's that Grim Reaper guy!
He's like a walking freakish weather system.
I take it that he used to be Erigor-san of Eisenwald.
Eisenwald... Erigor...
They ring no bells...
What's with you? You've got a lousy memory.
But I do know what the weather is going to be like next...
A blast of wind from above!
Along with occasional tornadoes from the side!
Not even flies
would dare defy natural phenomena.
This guy...
Bickslow-san, I'll support you!
Alright! We ain't flies!
Don't underestimate Fairy Tail wizards!
A gale from below!
What's wrong? Are you just all talk?
Dammit!
I'll heal you...
We don't got time for that!
That's...
Fairy... Tail... It's not coming to me...
But I know what the next weather pattern will be...
Storm... A storm! A storm from right in front of you!
I'll stop it!
Roar of the Sky Dragon!
What kind of soul does that girl have?!
Followed by lightning from behind!
You hit'em, huh?
I've already moved the souls to other dolls!
Take this! Zero Distance Baryon Formation!
What...?!
Hey, it's cowardly to fly out of the way!
So it seems... I had forgotten...
By the way, who are you two?
What the hell?
He's already forgotten about us.
Wing Slash of the Sky Dragon!
You challenge me, master of weather phenomena, with wind magic?
You should know your place!
Wendy! Watch out!
Be careful of flying objects due to strong wind!
Cow stink!
Oh, no... It's my fault...
Bickslow-san!
The Infinity Clock was completed and stolen by Oracion Seis.
So what are you people after now?
According to my calculations,
the situation is becoming more complicated than first anticipated, Nii-san.
So much that my calculations can't keep up.
I know!
You want to help us, don't you? After all, you're a fellow Exceed!
You guess correctly.
If they're not careful,
it's likely the humans will find themselves powerless to do anything.
You say this now?!
I thought Zentopia's teachings were everything to you.
Doctrine is important too, but this is no time to be particular.
I see.
So what should we do?
Sorry, but as Happy only ever has fish on the mind,
and Nii-san is just a musclehead, you two wouldn't be able to comprehend it.
How rude!
Did you come here to start another fight?!
Carla...
Did you sense anything with your power of precognition?
I saw various unclear images, but they made me feel uneasy...
Images of the Key of the Starry Heavens?
Yes. I think it was a warning.
You weren't meant to collect the pieces of the clock.
It seems the device was originally the property of Zentopia.
And now, we're being given an unfathomable mission.
Do you wanna know the future, Sammy?
What's most ominous of all
is the possibility that Zentopia's doctrine is being misused.
What the hell is this?
We didn't get here in time?
Why... do we...
I totally... don't get it...
His Holiness gave us this mission, remember?
Why do you keep griping about it?
Telepathy?
Not Oracion Seis... Is that Legion?
Guild wizards?
Are you one of Zentopia's, asshole?
A falling out?
Why did we... have to do that... to a priest?
His Holiness's words are the Archbishop's words. In other words, it's doctrine.
If we're told to destroy something, it's Legion's job to destroy it!
According to doctrine, never, ever doubt the faith!
Bastard...
Scatter, traitor!
Don't!
What the...?!
An explosion... No, that's not it...
Gajeel-kun, be careful!
I don't like you, asshole!
It seems you both have extremely high levels of magic in your bodies. How convenient.
Pretty lights! What a nice rapture!
What the hell is this thing?!
Juvia doesn't know this magic...
It's based on explosions... Rapture Magic...
He swells up the magic power in a person's body instantaneously and makes it explode.
Scatter! Scatter!
Juvia! Don't give in!
I know, Gajeel-kun!
As long as you have magic power in your body,
I can keep you two dancing to my tune.
Does it hurt?!
Embrace the pain...
Archbishop...
Why did you release someone like this?
This... is what Zentopia teaches?
Hey! Ain't anybody home?!
We don't allow outsiders to enter.
Don't be so petty. Just open the damn door.
Hey!
That was too straight.
When it comes to seducing a woman, the best way is a straight pitch.
What is it that you're proud of?
There's only one thing to do. Laki... Come here a second.
Wha...?!
Listen...
If you lay a hand on me, I'll tell Cana!
It'll be a mix of truth and lies, with 85 lies!
Not that. I'm being serious here...
Look carefully at this abbey.
Molding Magic certainly is convenient.
Hey! Don't take advantage of the situation to touch my privates!
Don't kick me!
It stinks!
Sorry. It slipped out...
They spotted us...
Yeesh. It turned out this way after all...
And whose fault is that?!
What is this?
All the hair on my body is standing on end!
You mean to say these people are creeping you out, right?
Wood Make! Heart's Sense of Distance!
Don't try and mob us!
Don't! You can't hit a nun!
What's with these people?!
Jeez, what a pain in the ass!
Stay away, I said!
That's enough, assholes!
Y-You massacred them?!
No! Look closely!
They ain't human!
What is this? A doll made from earth and wood?
It doesn't seem like Molding Magic...
What are those Zentopia clowns thinking?
Or more like, what are they hiding?
Maybe it's something even worse than the Master feared.
Yeah...
It looks like you were right on the money, Macao.
No need to hold back. Let's move in!
Hasn't Oracion Seis gotten a lot stronger than the last time we fought them?
Maybe it's because they can't afford to lose for some reason...
Could be. But we can't afford to lose either!
You said it! We're gonna wipe the floor with them
and keep that chaos whatever from happenin'!
Natsu, that's a pretty important key phrase.
Next time: Anti-Link!
Winning is more important than words!
Well, yeah, but that's a blunt conclusion.
It's better to keep it simple with stuff like this.
