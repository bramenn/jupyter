Found it! It's this!
Hot Springs A complete guide to the most popular traditional inns
I'm nervous...
Yeah...
I just can't open it!
You open it, Minchi!
Why me?
Well, I think we did well, so we should be fine,
but what are we going to do if they've
written something bad about us.
So, what are we going to do?
A perfect score...
F-F-F-
Five out of five stars...
No...
It's five out of ten stars.
What?
Episode 11 Bark at the Night
Takako!
I need to contact Takako!
Takako!
If you applied the term retro,
it would be too much of a compliment.
It's undeniable that the inn isn't suited for this era,
and the meals served are plain and boring.
Like hell they are!
Mr. Ren is always trying
his best to make the most delicious meals possible!
Don't you feel frustrated?!
Yeah, and I was certain we did everything perfectly that day too.
This discussion ends here.
Everyone, return to your workstations.
Madam Manager!
Didn't you hear me?
I don't like repeating myself.
Please!
Let me talk to the person who wrote that article!
I won't stand for this!
Please!
W-Wait, hang on!
B-Beanman.
Where's Madam Manager?
At Fukuya.
What?
All of the inns around the
Yunosagi Hot Springs area scored poorly.
This is an extremely serious situation...
considering how, not too far from Yunosagi
something of this scale is being constructed.
8000 yen a night, eh?
I'd like to pay them a visit one day.
What are you talking about?!
The completion of this project will be a huge blow to Yunosagi!
We shouldn't be competing with them on this.
The quality is what counts-
And this magazine questions our quality!
This is not the time to be fighting amongst one another.
Everyone in the Yunosagi group needs to work together.
Watcha doin'?
Sorry for dragging you to help me.
These will be used in the Bonbori Festival, right?
Yeah. Isn't it a pain?
But Grandma's really irritated at the moment,
so arguing with her is a bad idea right now.
Of course she's irritated.
Everyone was given such awful reviews,
and some huge hotel's being built nearby.
But it sounds really nice.
I'd like to stay there at least once!
Yuina...
If you do that, I'm calling you balut.
No...
You're not the one to blame here.
Umm...
Yeah!
I don't care how you feel.
I'm gonna fest it up!
Fest it up?
I just made that phrase up!
You're so funny, Ohana.
You want a vacation?
Yes.
I want to know why the publishers gave us that review.
Ohana...
We don't have a lot of customers this weekend,
and even though I tried calling-
That's a waste of time.
Reviews are supposed to be given by others, not by yourself.
But...
Even if you're unsatisfied with the review,
you need to accept it,
move on, and work to improve yourself.
But...
But it is wrong!
Ohana...
That's because...
Kissuiso...
is a much better inn than any of the others!
I refuse to accept such a review.
Ohana went looking for a fight?!
She left a note.
Let me see...
I'm going to
talk to the person who gave
Kissuiso that crazy review.
I'm gonna fest it up.
What does that even mean?
Maybe Ohana's Japanese deserves
a five out of ten too.
Yes, you've reached Kissuiso.
Okay.
I understand.
Hello, you've reached Kissuiso.
Okay.
Madam Manager, a customer who had
a reservation with us just canceled.
Seriously?!
Umm...
This customer's canceling too...
It's because of that magazine!
Madam Manager!
Madam Manager!
Working hard so my wish will come true. My wish at the Bonbori Festival. Fest it up
Fest it up.
Nakochi
Sorry...
I can't answer the phone right now.
I need to fest it up.
I need to fest it up in order to protect Kissuiso.
Well, that article was written by an editor.
We don't have anything to do with-
You published it yet you're saying that you have nothing to do with this?!
Are you that irresponsible?!
So the mass media really is as evil as everyone says?!
No...
Well...
Tell me!
Who in the world wrote this awful article?
N-Now...
You're close! Too close!
I'm sorry!
Please tell me!
Okay...
This is the-
The spawn of the devil!
Ohana!
How have you been?!
It's been so long since I've felt this warmth!
What's wrong?
You don't look too happy.
Who would be happy after being betrayed by a member of their own family?
Jeez... you always say such harsh things!
Oh, are you hungry?
I broke up with him soon after.
Work is so much more fun.
That's why I came back alone.
I've always wanted to do a moonlight flit.
That was the climax of our relationship.
How...
How can you say such awful things about your
own home without even visiting?
Rankings like those are caused by unavoidable circumstances.
Someone high up wants Kissuiso to score poorly.
I just obeyed their orders and wrote it.
You wrote that article
without knowing anything about how the Kissuiso is doing?!
C-Calm down.
Gratin tastes bad once it cools down.
Don't change the subject!
You're always like that!
You never think of anyone's feelings.
You never bother discussing anything with me,
and always make all the decisions by yourself.
This article, the moonlight flit,
the time we moved when I was in 2nd grade,
my Christmas present when I was in 5th grade...
I didn't want a teddy bear!
I wanted a sticker book!
You promised me one in November!
I can't believe you still remember that.
It made me sad!
But you didn't say anything
when I gave you your present.
I held it in!
That's right...
I've always held things in.
Even when you went out late at night
and it was dark and I was afraid to be alone,
I still didn't complain!
Parents' day at school, the zoo, the pool...
I never complained when you bailed out on them...
You know you just shifted the subject to your personal grudge, right?
I never complained because it always had something to do with your work.
That's why I held it in.
I was holding everything back this whole time
for a job that hurts others?
All this time... for something like that?!
That's right.
I've had this job for a while.
I raised you with a job like this.
Don't tell me
that you thought that all my work consisted of
something that you could be proud of.
From your point of view- No,
even from my point of view, my job is full of crap.
But I still work hard for it.
That's why...
Fine.
Huh?
I get it, but I want you to write it.
I told you, I can't put up a correction notice.
You don't need to apologize in a magazine!
All I'm asking you is for you to come to Kissuiso,
and write precisely how you really feel after your stay.
I don't care if it doesn't get published in a magazine.
As long as you realize that Kissuiso is a wonderful inn, I...
I can't.
I'm busy enough as it is.
Please!
No.
I'm not giving up.
Not until you write it.
I'll make you write it for sure!
Wait... Ohana!
Seconds.
Thank you, please come again.
I realize that my mother's a tough opponent.
I've always lost to her up until now.
But...
Yeah, I'm serious!
Stop pulling my leg!
I'm not!
I haven't told Ko I'm in town yet.
No, that's not why I came to Tokyo.
To: Ko Hey Ko, it's Ohana. What are your plans for today?
Make this part a bit more provoking.
Sure.
Satsuki?
Yes?
Look at that.
Matsumae Satsuki, regain your human heart!
Wake up! Release your soul!
Unforgivable staged articles!
Jeez...
Isn't that your daughter?
What are you going to do?
Just leave her be.
You think she'll give up?
Nah, she won't.
What?
Unforgivable, eh?
Just how long do you plan on staying mad at me, Ohana?
It's already published.
There's nothing I can do.
No, I won't forgive you.
It's part of my job. Forgive me.
I'll never forgive you!
For eternity!
Do you know what eternity means?
Yes!
Looks like I'll never be forgiven...
Huh?
Okay, back to work.
I won't lose.
I'll take her back to Kissuiso no matter what.
Matsumae Satsuki, regain your human heart!
Wake up! Release your soul!
Unforgivable staged articles!
From: Ko Hey. I'm going to be at work today.
Work...
To: Ko Work? The hauler again?
It's been a while.
This scenery, this conversation with Ko...
Even though it hasn't
even been 6 months since I moved.
From: Ko Nah, I'm working at the huge bookstore in Ikebukuro today.
Well, Ikebukuro was only one stop away, after all.
The sign doesn't look great right now,
so I should read some difficult books to learn difficult words...
Koichi!
Where should I put this?
Oh, that goes...
Here?
No.
How am I supposed to know?
Come on...
Come on, guys, stop flirting during work.
Y-You've got it all wrong!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Ohana?
Nope, you've got the wrong gal.
Ohana?
Yes?!
What are you doing here?
Oh... I just happened to drop by!
You just happened to drop by Tokyo?
Who's that?
Oh, she's...
I'm sorry for disturbing you!
Good luck with work!
Later!
Ohana!
So, are you almost at your limit, Ohana?
Shut up, old lady.
So you've finally reached puberty, eh?
Come with me to Kissuiso, old lady.
No.
Old lady...
Old lady...
I refuse to receive sympathy from an enemy.
I refuse...
Ohana!
Ko...
He was cracking up!
Look, Mom!
Shouldn't you be at work?
Nah.
Are you working hard too?
Yeah.
But we also need to show results.
The customer needs to tell me that I'm working hard.
I can't be the one saying that I am.
I guess...
Maybe that was a bit forward of me.
Ko, are you mad at me for coming here out of the blue?
There's so much I want to tell you.
Ko, did you grow a bit taller?
Ko, what's your relationship with that girl from earlier?
Ko, do you still like-
I-I'm going for seconds!
O-Okay.
I don't get it.
Why did I come to Tokyo anyway?
I have so many pent up feelings...
Huh?
You still do that?
You mixed tea and Coke!
I want to drink Coke, but the fizz is too strong for me.
It hurts my mouth.
Don't lose to Coke.
Ko...
How long have you been working at that bookstore?
About two months.
Everyone at the store seemed really friendly with each other.
Yeah, we're all about the same age too.
That girl was cute too.
You think so?
Ko...
I get the feeling she likes you.
Yeah.
Yeah? Did she tell you?
Yeah.
What did you say to her?
I told her I couldn't return her feelings, but...
But?
But she told me she'd wait,
so it's kind of unrequited.
It's rude to not give a proper answer!
That's-
It's rude to not give a proper answer.
He should be saying that to me, not the other way around.
I left his confession unrequited.
That's exactly what I did to him.
I-I'm going now.
Ohana?
I'll pay the bill.
No, I'll-
What's wrong?
I'll meet you downstairs.
I've seen this back before.
The rain's gotten heavier.
Wait here. I'll go and buy an umbrella-
I can buy one myself.
Bye.
Wait!
I don't want to see his back anymore.
Hey, you!
You're drenched!
Wet!
Huh? I-
Get in!
Hey, you're gonna catch a cold!
No...
I hate this...
No...
No!
Help me...
Help me, Ko!
Ohana!
Ohana!
Are you okay, Ohana?!
What are you doing out here?!
Hey, why are you crying-
I don't know!
I don't know!
I don't know...
I've...
I've never been moved in so many ways in one day before.
Do you have a girlfriend, Tohru?
Hey, Ohana! Where are you now?!
It's like a date...
An antagonist. All right.
Are you coming back, Ohana?
Episode 12 See Ya.
See ya.
