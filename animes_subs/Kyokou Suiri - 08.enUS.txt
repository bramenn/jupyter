The first time I met her, I knew instantly...
She must've been Kuro-kun's first love.
She seems nice, Kuro.
This is my girlfriend and my senpai in college, Yumihara Saki-san.
I-It's nice to meet you!
Well, I'll be at the cafe downstairs.
Huh?
I'd just be in the way here.
I just wanted to say hello. So you can take your time, okay?
If you'll excuse me.
So she's Kuro-kun's...
But it seemed like she was
silently...
silently corrupting those around her.
That's how she seemed.
I heard Sakuragawa-san was taken to the operating room again yesterday.
Really? She tried to kill herself again?
Maybe the rumor that she's tried to kill herself multiple times is true.
I heard she doesn't have long to live.
She was tying you down.
But if going out with Iwanaga-san will help you break free of that...
I think it's a good thing, despite feeling conflicted.
Saki-san, I do love Rikka-san, and I might be tied down,
but I do sometimes wish she wasn't around.
That she wasn't around? Didn't Rikka-san pass away?
Rikka-san hasn't passed away.
That's not possible.
Saki-san, Rikka-san is my cousin.
Don't tell me she's also... a Sakuragawa.
I screwed up... I screwed up so bad.
How could I create time for Kuro-senpai and Saki-san to be alone together?!
What in the world happened? Why are things so awkward now?!
Iwanaga.
This would be a good time to replenish some nutrients.
It's about time for Steel Lady Nanase to appear.
If I'm here,
the ayakashi that come to tell you about Steel Lady Nanase might get scared.
Saki-san, I'll be waiting by the exit.
All right. Then I'll be in the car with Iwanaga-san.
Saki-san just had someone close to her get murdered,
and now she and Kuro-san, who's such a kind person...
They are a man and woman who planned to get married at one point.
I was asleep for about an hour and a half.
You could do a lot in an hour and a half...
And I mean a lot!
Iwanaga-san.
Have you ever met Rikka-san?
Yes, I have, but...
The hospital where Rikka-san was admitted was also where I was staying.
I see. So you know that she also ate the flesh of a kudan and a mermaid.
Senpai mentioned that he hadn't told Saki-san about
Rikka-san's condition...
Is she trying to get me to spill something?
Oh, very well.
I do, because Rikka-san was also feared by the monsters.
Though she and Kuro-senpai haven't told me the details,
she was apparently hospitalized
long-term so that her body and abilities could be examined.
Is that what it was?
How is she lately?
She was living in my mansion up until a month ago.
What?
She was suddenly discharged at the beginning of the year.
But why would she go to your house?
As his girlfriend, how could I possibly let her and Kuro-senpai live together?
Rikka-san was discharged due to the appointment of
a new hospital director and the resulting change in political climate.
Because the hospital really didn't know what to do with her, either.
I'm sure there were many who were happy to see her go.
Sakuragawa Rikka- sama
And because of that, there were rumors that Rikka-san didn't have long to live.
So what do you say? How do you feel about leaving the hospital soon?
Do you really have to say it like that?
What if she resists?
Then she'll leave us no choice.
All right. I understand.
Thank you for all you've done for me.
I need to get my things together, so could you call my cousin Kuro?
Rikka-san.
Given your rather sudden discharge, do you have a place to stay?
Not yet.
What?
Let me stay at your place for a while.
You can't! My place is really small!
I can't?
I'll do the housework for you.
House... work...?
Your bath is ready.
Goodnight.
Did I say something strange?
No! But, I mean... I only have one bed...
Well, you do live on your own.
Wh-Which is exactly why...
I know! I'll talk to Iwanaga about it.
Iwanaga's parents know a lot of people,
so they might be able to think of something.
You don't have to go through all that.
If I can't stay at your place, I could always stay in a park...
Iwanaga? There's something I want to talk to you about.
Kuro-san! What is it? It's unusual for you to turn to me for help.
You see
Wait.
Allow me to charge you a consultation fee.
Really? The Goddess of Wisdom is going to charge a consultation fee?
Indeed. Depending on the client, I'd prefer favors or offerings over cash.
I won't be asking for much.
But this discussion might involve you, too...
Kuro-san, where are you right now?
The special lecture you wanted to attend at the university is happening right now.
Yet you're contacting me and asking me for something.
This is no ordinary matter.
It is now 5:00 PM.
And that very familiar recording I hear over the phone...
You're at the hospital right now.
Which means that this has to do
with Rikka-san.
So I should be allowed to be a bit forceful about this.
Fear not. I wouldn't ask for anything too difficult.
Let's hear the conditions.
Let me have the spare key to your apartment.
Don't be ridiculous.
What's ridiculous about your girlfriend asking for the spare key
to your apartment?!
It's not like I plan to do anything bad.
Wouldn't it be lovely to have your girlfriend do your housework
House... work...?
I didn't cut any corners preparing your meals or your bed!
Bathing together! Bathing together!
Sleeping together! Sleeping together!
Kuro! I found a nice place to stay.
Huh?!
Steamy
Napping rooms available!!
Health Land
The biggest bathhouse in the world
Here it is.
Okay. I'll give you my key, so help me out.
This makes me so happy.
At last, I'm your common-law wife!
Yeah, no.
And so I went to pick them up immediately,
and Rikka-san left the hospital behind.
So, yes...
I mean, she was a mysterious patient who had been
in the hospital for five years.
So after she left, rumors spread that she had passed away.
And those rumors somehow reached me?
In reality, she was doing rather well.
Rikka-san is quite beautiful and very well-mannered,
So Rikka-san didn't hate you?
Why do you just assume she hated me?
When I first met Rikka-san...
Kuro, I don't think she's a good match for you.
I completely agree!
Huh?
That's cringe-worthy.
Yes. We all cringed.
Rikka-san even tried to remedy the situation.
I mean, she's not good for you,
but she might not be the worst for you, either.
You actually made Rikka-san feel bad?
You bet I did.
After that, we made up, and occasionally went out together without Kuro-senpai.
We would even throw birthday parties for each otherwith cake, of course!
Just the two of you?!
Happy birthday!
Thank you!
Yay!
Then what's she up to now?
You said she was at your place until a month ago, right?
We don't know where she is right now.
Huh?
A month ago, she told my parents that she had officially found
a job and a place to stay, and she left.
We couldn't contact her on her cell,
and the new address and workplace she'd given us were fake.
What did Kuro-kun do after he heard that?
Senpai went berserk and pushed me down...
Then, as if to vent his frustrations, he forcefully...
Answer the question seriously.
Nothing, at first. He just said that Rikka-san probably had something in mind.
But two weeks later, he started trying to get a hold of her repeatedly,
then he sent me a single message and disappeared.
Kuro-senpai
no subject
Something came up. Don't look for me.
So, Saki-san, what's bothering you?
What did you and Senpai talk about while I was asleep?
I guess it didn't take you long to realize that Rikka-san was behind Steel Lady Nanase.
Kuro-kun didn't come here because you called him.
He was looking for Rikka-san.
Something must've gotten them to talk about Rikka-san.
Not that I really care that she found out.
So nothing happened between them.
I can relax, then.
Why did you hide it from me?
Because I didn't have any proof.
Even when she was at my place, Rikka-san would mess with the computer,
but I never actually looked at what she was doing.
I never would've thought that she was
creating a wiki page and bringing Steel Lady Nanase to life.
And I didn't really know about Steel Lady Nanase
until the monsters came to talk to me.
I only realized that Rikka-san was involved when I saw
the picture on the wiki page I'd found when doing some research.
Picture? You mean the picture that's on the main page?
Yes, precisely.
It was painted in Rikka-san's style.
She Who Spins Fiction
I believe it was about a year ago...
She suddenly became very serious about painting.
Looking back on it now,
I believe Rikka-san intended to create
a monster of the imagination even back then.
In order to consolidate hundreds of thousands
of fantasies and give them a shared vision of a monster, name and shape are key.
The most effective way would be to illustrate the story with a picture.
When shown it, everyone would have the same image in mind.
I'm sure Nanase Karin's accident gave her the perfect material.
Though only known to some, she was still an idol in the public eye.
Nanase Karin's True Form
She was involved in a dark scandal and died a very dramatic death.
Add a ghost to the mix,
and it has ample opportunity to evolve into a yokai or urban legend.
There might've already been rumors
of the ghost of Nanase Karin appearing in Makurazaka City,
but the one who amplified them was Rikka-san.
I'm assuming the one who gave her the name Steel Lady Nanase
and made up the accompanying stories was also Rikka-san.
Kuro-senpai realized this, too.
While he was looking for Rikka-san,
he heard rumors about Steel Lady Nanase and sensed something.
And after he saw the picture on the Steel Lady Nanase wiki page,
he knew for sure, and so he came here.
Saki-san,
you're someone who decided to live your life seeing only the real world.
What will you do now that you know what lies in the shadows?
Kuro-senpai probably
didn't tell you because he didn't want to further involve you in this.
I see.
Because Rikka-san, who has the same kudan ability to control
the future that Kuro-kun does, was pulling the strings,
Steel Lady Nanase was able to mature this quickly.
That's very likely.
Rikka-san probably died over and over to get the future where
people on the Internet wouldn't stop talking about Steel Lady Nanase,
and came back to life.
But why would she do that?
What good comes out of creating a monster that will kill indiscriminately?
She has the power to determine the future,
but it's actually not all that impressive.
Kuro-senpai says that, too.
He can only choose a future that's within the scope of his own talents,
potential, and effort.
Meaning he's not that different from a normal person.
But she successfully created a monster.
She's probably trying to find out
how far she can go with her ability to decide the future.
She stacks possibility upon possibility
and chosen future upon chosen future.
If you take a phenomenon that has a fifty-fifty chance of happening
and make it happen ten times in a row,
you get a phenomenon that only has a 1 in 1,024 chance of happening.
You can toss a coin and have it come up heads 10,000 times in a row.
Normally, Steel Lady Nanase would have little chance of coming to life,
but she's one of those possible variations.
It's not like you can get anywhere by creating a monster.
My lady.
That infernal Steel Lady has appeared.
Please come with us.
It's just a goblin cat.
There's no reason to be scared.
It's time to go, Saki-san.
Honestly...
We'll put Rikka-san's goals aside for now
and concentrate on defeating Steel Lady Nanase.
Whatever Rikka-san's goal may be, it doesn't change anything.
This world is not uncertain.
It may be full of yokai, monsters, spectres, and demons,
but there is reason that cannot be overturned.
And it's my duty to protect that.

Because of the incident with Detective Terada,
I'm sure people want more information and want to say things.
If the one managing the site is Rikka-san,
couldn't she censor or even delete your posts?
Rikka-san wouldn't do that.
If she censors or deletes any posts concerning doubts about ghosts,
that'll give the impression that
the admin has some kind of problem with those posts.
That'll get users to believe that these posts are being censored or deleted
because the ghost doesn't actually exist.
That would be disadvantageous for someone who wants Steel Lady Nanase to exist.
So she has no choice but to leave all the posts alone.
I see. You mentioned that you came up with four solutions.
But does it really just come down to numbers?
Sometimes, numbers are all you need for lies to break through the truth
and create a new truth all together.
What's about to take place on the Steel Lady Nanase wiki page
may resemble a committee to discuss a proposed bill in a parliament,
board of directors, or board of trustees.
The matter up for discussion
is if there really is a ghost named Steel Lady Nanase or not.
Rikka-san has already gained majority support,
and she has plenty of data and a well-grounded argument
to support her existence.
So will I be able to somehow overturn the majority opinion and win the vote?
This is where my true skills come in.
If she's already won the majority,
won't it be near impossible to reverse the situation?
Yes.
If this was a normal parliament or board of directors,
those with voting rights would have formed alliances.
And there are too many risks in declaring the opposite opinion at the last minute.
But the ones who have the voting rights in this committee

are everyone viewing the site.

Their opinions are everything.
So irresponsible judges who have no idea they're involved.
That's scary in and of itself.
Correct.
But if you look at it another way,
it's because this assembly bears no responsibility
that nothing will hold them back. Not the law, justice, or even the truth.
Even if the solution is unjust or untrue,
as long as the majority of the tens of thousands
of the site viewers support it, we win.

If we present a plausible story
that fits with enough of the facts and is interesting enough,
the masses will irresponsibly support it and vote in our favor.
Which means anything goes with this committee.
We can obscure and hide the real data, call black white,
and present several contradicting answers.
As long as they seem reasonable at a glance and are entertaining enough...
Then we can turn fiction into fact.
We can actually get away with that here.
I will stop at nothing to win.
I will put everything I have into these lies.
The committee to conquer Steel Lady Nanase is now in session!

Does Steel Lady Nanase actually exist?
