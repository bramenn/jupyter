What's that?
A tatami?
Isn't that Ayase Chihaya?
Ayase?
You know?
The one who was putting up that karuta club poster.
Oh, Beauty in vain.
Isn't that Mashima from Class 1 with her?
Mashima, as in the one who had
the top score in our grade on the last test?
Huh? A karuta club?
When they're both so famous...
All in vain...
Club in vain...
Chihaya, we're attracting too much attention.
Hey, where's Oe-san?
She was here a moment ago...
Is she skipping practice again?
The captain will have a fit.
So spring ends and summer comes
now white robes hang to dry on Mount Amanokagu
Oe-san! Where did you go?
Oe-san!
The upperclassmen are throwing a fit!
I-I'm sorry!
Chihaya Furu
Verse 6
Now Bloom Inside the Ninefold Palace
This is it.
Huh?
We finally made it!
This is our clubroom?
Yeah.
I kept begging the Empress and she finally gave it to us.
It's a storage room.
There's dust everywhere.
Don't complain!
It's quiet. Perfect for playing karuta!
Okay, back we go!
We need three more!
What? This is enough...
How can you say that,
after the nice man agreed to share these with us?!
Once we have five members, we'll be recognized as an official club,
and they'll even assign us a teacher!
Can we even find three more people?
We can!
We absolutely can!
Now look, Chihaya.
Hmm?
Do we really need more members?
I was pretty surprised.
I never knew that was how you felt.
If I can be the best in the world at something,
I think it's worth a shot.
Your goal is to become the Queen, right?
Huh?
Y-Yeah...
You're not serious about this at all, are you?!
You were just following Arata's lead!
Anyway!
We have to carry three more tatami mats over!
Then we practice!
Right. Yeah, yeah.
What's Oe-san like?
Archery Club
No idea. She's always reading old books by herself.
She was born in the wrong era.
I'm sorry,
but I can't do it!
Why must I run in a hakama?
That would be so embarrassing!
And I'll never be able to hit a target with an arrow!
I just want to wear traditional clothes!
Let's start a competitive karuta club! Please come see Ayase Chihaya in class 1-2!!
Ayase Chihaya-san in class 1-2...
The lovely girl who turns heads everywhere
is looking for people who know the poems of the Hundred Poets.
Oh, dear. You took another card off me.
You're still very strong, Lady Chihaya.
I should have knocked on this door instead!
I thought that Ms. Miyauchi was using the old student council room.
Oh, no...
What if they already have too many members?
when people and grass grow scarce
Rain takes...
leaving a hovering mist above the trees and grass
Huh?!
You're too good at first-syllable cards.
Huh? Huh?
The storm blasts...
Wait... What...
I wish I could show...
What is this?
My fear is not of...
Don't tell me that...
Thank you very much!
I won!
But you're actually pretty good.
You took a bunch of cards in the first half.
I think I've figured out why you always start slow.
Huh?
You rely on the advantage of your ears so much
that you haven't learned how to memorize card positions.
You still can't memorize where the cards are.
That's not true.
Today was just a fluke.
I have no trouble in the first half at the Shiranami Society.
You've only been practicing at the Shiranami Society, right?
People who train together tend to use the same positioning techniques, so it's easier.
Against me, you kept touching the wrong cards.
So in other words,
you're an idiot.
Yet you lost to that idiot!
Idiot!
You even talk like an idiot, idiot.
Oh?
Huh?
Huh?
Wait!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Why are you running away?!
Are you here because you're interested in karuta?!
Do you like karuta?!
Y-Yes, I guess...
As you already know,
the Ogura Hundred Poets lived during the Kamakura period.
Fujiwara no Teika
compiled them by taking one poem each from 100 of the best poets,
in chronological order from Emperor Tenji to the Retired Emperor Juntoku
to decorate the sliding doors at the Ogura mountain villa,
the summer home of the general and poet Utsunomiya Yoritsuna.
I love the backstory.
Many of the selected poems were ornamental in nature,
because they were meant to be used as decoration.
His judgment was wonderful!
Seventy-nine male poets!
Twenty-one female poets!
I paid particular attention to the poems by the women!
You can feel the seasons and modesty in a way
that can't be found in modern poetry!
The beauty in each word
is just as fresh as it was a thousand years ago!
I still haven't found the words
to express the rush of emotion they bring me!
R-Right!
So!
Do you like competitive karuta?
Do you wear hakama?
Hakama?
I've never worn one before.
You haven't either, Taichi?
Huh? Yeah...
Most people don't wear them.
Why?!
Only members of the imperial court dabble in poetry!
I wouldn't expect you to wear junihitoe,
but you should at least wear a hakama!
The kendo club and archery club require hakama!
Wh
Why don't we wear them?
Because they're expensive?
It's a lot of effort to wear one.
My family has owned a traditional clothing shop for many generations.
I love kimono.
I want everyone to understand how wonderful they are,
but we can only sell cheap yukatas...
Our business is so bad that
we can't even afford a model for next year's catalog!
If I won't be able to wear a hakama,
I might as well stay in the archery club.
I apologize for interrupting you.
Her love of karuta is completely different.
We don't even pay any attention to the poems anymore.
You probably don't know the meaning of most of them.
She isn't cut out to play competitive karuta.
She's so adorable.
Hey, look.
There she is!
Wow, you read really hard books.
A-Ayase-san!
I asked one of the girls in the archery club.
Your name is Oe Kanade, right?
So you're Kana.
You like karuta, right?
Let's play karuta together.
Yamamori Masao Higashiyama Culture and Modern Japan
My love for karuta is fundamentally different from yours.
I'm not interested in a sport with no emotion.
But Kana-chan, I'm also...
If you'll excuse me...
Huh?
Kana-chan?
The first collection of laws,
the Omi code, was created at the order of Emperor Tenji.
In 670, there was a national census released as the Kogo...
Kana-chan!
Hey, why don't you come watch us play?
I have archery practice.
Wait, Kana-chan!
Taichi...
There's no point in pestering someone who doesn't want to join.
But she loves karuta so much...
Like I said yesterday,
she's not cut out for it.
Oe Traditional Clothing
Kanade, I'm going to a neighborhood meeting,
so watch the store for me.
Okay!
Explanation for Ogura Hundred Poets
Would the mountain cherry blossoms return my affection,
for there is no one else out here
Ayase-san.
It's beautiful.
I'm starting to understand why you like kimono.
Is this about the karuta club again?
Hmm?
Well, you seem to like karuta.
As I said earlier,
my love is fundamentally different from yours.
But I also have a poem I really love.
Impassionate gods have never seen
the red that is the Tatsuta River
I even know what it means.
It's talking about how the Tatsuta River is so beautiful
when it's completely red.
I read it in a book.
It must look something like this.
Classic poetry becomes fascinating when
you know the history behind each poem.
Huh?
I believe that this poem is about passionate love.
Huh? Love?
It's not about scenery?!
That would be the universal interpretation,
but did you know that Nijo no Kisaki was in love
with Ariwara no Narihira before she married the emperor?
This is a very famous story.
N-No...
This poem was displayed on a folding screen in the palace.
Some accounts say that Nijo no Kisaki was the one who requested the poem.
I like how Narihira concealed his passion for her in a scenic rendering
since he wasn't able to forget about her.
Impassionate is a decorative word for gods that implies great force.
The red river can be interpreted as an autumn scene or a suicide,
but I believe that the crimson leaves represent a love that never faded.
the red that is the Tatsuta River
When you look at it that way, the card with its black letters
becomes deep red, don't you think?
Incredible...
Huh?
Incredible!
Incredible!
Incredible! Incredible! Incredible!
Teach me more, Kana-chan!
Huh?
Starting from The Autumn Paddy!
Huh?
All one hundred poems?
Uh-huh!
This poem is supposed to have been written by Emperor Tenji.
Huh? It wasn't?
Yes, it's believed that this was
edited from an anonymous poem
in the Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves.
Oh...
Fujiwara no Teika, the person who compiled the Hundred Poets,
would have known that...
The autumn paddy shacks have rough thatching
as my sleeves are wet with dew
A paddy shack is a small cabin for farmers.
When the farmers rest under the rough roof of sedge and straw,
they wake up to discover that their sleeves are wet with dew.
So Fujiwara no Teika may have started with this poem
to convey the idea of an ideal emperor
who understood the hard work of the farmers.
Oh...
Next one!
So spring ends please!
In the past, when people unpacked their winter clothes,
they would hang their summer clothes out to dry.
The green mountains and white clothes...
There is only a brief pause between the verses...
As the slightest breeze will make the slender bamboo shake...
Mugwort was used for moxibustion.
Oh! Hence the burning feelings part!
When I must hide mugwort = moxibustion
I never knew...
The false rooster's crow is an expression from
I never knew!
the Records of the Grand Historian.
Here, shadow actually means light. So the moonlight is...
There is a rich and colorful world behind each card!
Here, the autumn scenery is green instead of red,
which means these are evergreens...
I never knew!
I had no idea!

She's always reading old books by herself.
A classical literature geek?
She was born in the wrong age.
Explanation for Ogura Hundred Poets
Teach me, Kana-chan!
Teach me more!
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Like the sound of someone knocking on my door...
The night was young...
Though I prayed
Before, I only recognized the cards by sound...
but you can also recognize them by their meaning!
Look!
Every card is a different color!
I win!
Oh, man...
You're on a roll today.
Have you been doing drills or something?
Kana-chan.
The person who taught me karuta
said that I should become friends with the cards.
You're already friends with all one hundred cards.
You can become strong.
O-On one condition...
Okay! Relax and smile!
P-Promise?
Promise that you'll join the karuta club?
No changing your mind!
And during matches, we all have to wear hakama.
Wh-What if we don't have one?
We can rent them.
Wait, stop!
But why were you trying so hard to recruit me?
You don't need other people to play karuta.
Well, I guess we can practice.
We can start with how to place the cards...
First, can we do something about this room?
Huh?
A house left to the weeds...
As I said the other day,
only members of the imperial court dabble in poetry.
This dusty room is not appropriate for-
Okay, let's!
Can't we just keep the tatami mats clean?
Okay, let's go borrow the cleaning stuff.
Yes!
Come on! Hurry up, Taichi!
Yeah, yeah...
I want to play karuta with Arata again.
I want him to know that karuta is fun...
That it's fun when you're with friends.
Then we'll start with how to place the cards.
Yes!
Our new friend, Kana-chan taught me something new.
Chihaya furu is a poem about deep red love!
