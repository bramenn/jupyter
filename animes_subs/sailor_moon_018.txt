The doll with blue eyes was stomped flat by a monster!
A doll has all the heart and soul of its creator!
I bet even the dolls for the Girl's Day Festival are upset!
In the name of the moon, Sailor Moon will punish you!
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute yume no naka nara ieru
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen ima sugu aitai yo
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight denwa mo dekinai midnight
Datte junjou dou shiyou heart wa mangekyou
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare
Nando mo meguriau
Seiza no matataki kazoe uranau koi no yukue
Onaji kuni ni umareta no miracle romance
Shinjite iru no miracle romance
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like a super heroine, but I am!
As you know, I transform myself by using a peculiar brooch
and fight against bad guys.
I'm the sailor warrior of love and justice, Sailor Moon!
And my friends are the smart and sweet Ami Mizuno,
and a slightly quick-tempered psychic girl, Rei Hino.
Both of them are so dependable, I feel like I'll fall behind.
But anyway, I just have to do my best!
Shingo's Innocent Love! A Sorrowful French Doll
Nephrite, how are things going with the sailor warriors?
I believe you had entrusted that matter to me.
It seems you are having quite a hard time.
I would be more than happy to help you.
The operations are bound to go better with two of us rather than one.
Don't you think so, Queen Beryl?
That is a good idea. Nephrite, work with Zoisite and...
I refuse. That is a good idea. Nephrite, work with Zoisite and...
I refuse.
Oh, dear. Do you intend to defy Queen Beryl?
I am not doing this for Queen Beryl!
I am doing this for myself!
Excuse me!
Nephrite...
Everything went just as planned.
Now, Queen Beryl will have lost confidence in Nephrite.
Oh, Usagi. You're early today.
This is what normal people do, stupid Usagi!
Shingo, it seems Mika won the French doll contest.
Really?!
I seem to remember that Mika's mother is a famous doll maker.
Like mother, like daughter.
Well, Mr. Shingo Tsukino,
how do you feel about having a celebrity for a girlfriend?
Stop it!
This was brought to you live from the Tsukino residence.
Stupid Usagi! You're gonna be late again! I'm leaving!
I got up early this morning, there is no way I...
Look at the time! I'm gonna be late!
Miss Tsukino, out in the hallway you go.
It's amazing how you never get tired of being late every day.
Leave me alone.
Excuse me, are you Shingo's older sister?
Yes, I am.
Shingo is so mean!
Did Shingo do something?
Today, at school...
Shingo. Shingo.
Oh, Mika. Congratulations on winning the contest!
Shingo, here.
What is it?
This is the French doll that won in the contest.
Is it okay? It must mean a lot to you.
Yeah, because you were always there when I needed to talk.
They're so in love!
So, when's the wedding?!
I don't want it!
It's not my fault.
And Shingo didn't even apologize to her!
I felt so bad for Mika.
Please talk to Shingo about this.
Shingo's definitely in the wrong!
Usagi...
As his older sister, you should have a word with him.
Right. Anyway, just let this wise and pretty older sister handle this!
I'll make sure that Shingo apologizes to Mika!
Come in.
What's wrong? Why do you have all the curtains closed?
I can concentrate better this way.
Oh, are you already making the next one?
She looks like she's about to start crying.
You think so?
But I don't think that's a bad thing.
Show me the doll that won the contest. Let's compare them!
I don't have it.
I'm letting someone borrow it for a while.
Who?
Well...
Show me when you get it back then.
Okay.
The stars know everything.
The Lyre's Orpheus is beginning to play his harp of sorrow.
The target Orpheus has chosen is Mika Kayama.
I will take your energy.
I'm sorry Mika. It was my fault.
I know you worked so hard to make that doll...
Oh, I can't! I can't! I can't! I can't write this letter!
Shingo! Your sister needs to talk to you! Oh, I can't! I can't! I can't! I can't write this letter!
Shingo! Your sister needs to talk to you!
Come in.
Ouch! What was that for?!
That was for Mika!
What?!
You broke Mika's doll today, didn't you?!
Go apologize to her immediately!
I don't want to hear about that anymore! Get out!
Okay, then I'll tell Mom and Dad about this!
What do you think will happen?
Uh-oh Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
You'll do exactly as I say, won't you?
Okay.
Then, go to Mika's house and apologize right away.
Got it?!
I get it.
I'm sorry! It was my fault!
I'll make this up to you, even if it takes me the rest of my life!
Okay, I'll go with that!
Wow! Awesome car!
Kayama
Kayama Yes?
Yes?
I am Masato Sanjoin. I spoke with you on the phone earlier.
Wait just a moment, please.
They've got a guest. I guess I'll come back later.
I had thought that Pierre Dumoe was the only one
who could make such classic dolls,
but this has changed my mind.
My, you are such a flatterer.
I see that your daughter is also very talented.
Her name is Mika.
The doll you entered in the contest the other day was wonderful.
I would love to see that doll.
Oh, the doll is...
Mika, why don't you show him the doll you're making right now?
Okay.
Oh, this is wonderful!
Excuse me.
Her sad expression is just so...
Monster, Jumo!
Bring Mika Kayama's energy to its peak level and steal it!
Isn't that great, Mika?
Would you make ten more dolls just like this one?
What? Ten?
This doll will sell out very quickly.
We are holding a private exhibition starting this Saturday.
Of course, my daughter's work will be there as well.
Please come see the exhibit.
I will be looking forward to it.
You finished it awfully quickly.
It's strange, but suddenly I feel so motivated.
Now, I have to make the second one.
I understand how you feel, but why don't you go to bed?
You have school tomorrow, remember?
I'll be fine.
Now, don't say that. Come on, let's clean up.
Shut up!
What? Mika is?
She's been making dolls since yesterday without any sleep.
I tried to stop her, but she wouldn't listen to me.
I don't know what to do.
I'll talk to her.
Mika, Shingo's here to see you.
I don't want to see him.
Mika, I need to talk...
Go away! Mika, I need to talk...
Go away!
I wonder if Mika's still mad at me?
Shingo, here you go.
Huh? What is this?
As a caring sister, I can't ignore my kid brother when he's upset.
You apologized to Mika, didn't you?
Well, the thing is...
I didn't know that.
Mika's always been so sweet, I couldn't believe it.
Did I hurt Mika's feelings that badly?
Cheer up! Oh, I know!
Why don't you bring her a present when you visit next time?
Girls love getting presents!
Okay.
Usagi, what's wrong?
I know what I told Shingo,
but Mika still isn't acting normal, you know?
Usagi, you're very sharp today!
When it comes to my darling kid brother, I do everything I can!
Besides, cursed dolls sound interesting!
Spare me the scary stuff!
Well, it could be something to do with the Dark Kingdom;
we should keep an eye on Mika.
Oh, right. In that case, let's have Ami and Rei handle it!
Usagi!
Okay, I got it.
Yoshiko Kayama Doll Exhibition Well? Do you see anything, Luna?
No. The curtains are closed, so I can't see inside.
According to Shingo, Mika hasn't been going to school either.
The only lead we have left
Yoshiko Kayama Doll Exhibition Classic Dolls The only lead we have left
Yoshiko Kayama Doll Exhibition Classic Dolls is this private exhibition that starts tomorrow.

New Sailor V
New Sailor V
Sailor V is nice, but I like Sailor Moon better.
Yeah, me, too.
Okay, that's what I'm going to get her!
A present for Mika?
Yeah.
Wow! It's cute! Good job!
You think so?
I'm sure she'll love that piggy!
It's Sailor Moon!
Oh, really. The real Sailor Moon would cry if she saw it.
It's the thought that counts! The thought!
Well, she's the envoy of love and justice after all, right?
Right!
And the dolls that this person makes are really adorable!
Oh, here we are.
Juban Art Museum
It's wonderful. This exhibition seems like a success.
Thank you very much.
Where is Miss Mika?
She's making the last one in the anteroom.
She worked herself to exhaustion to make those dolls.
Is that right?
Nothing looks particularly out of place.
Oh, that's Rei!
Oh, you're right.
Wow! They're so adorable! Mamoru, don't you think they're adorable?
Yeah...
Oh, that doll is made by the doll maker's daughter! Look!
What? Oh, that doll is made by the doll maker's daughter! Look!
What?
What? Oh, don't you know?
Oh, don't you know?
I'm not too much into dolls. Oh, don't you know?
I'm not too much into dolls.
Oh, Mamoru, you don't like dolls?
No, it's not like I hate them.
I'm so glad! Then shall we go?
Sure...
Do you want something?
No, pardon me. I mistook you for somebody else.
Mamoru! Hurry!
Reception How is Mika?
Reception Well, actually...
Well, actually...
Sis, I changed my mind.
What are you talking about?!
Mika is in the anteroom. I'm sure she'll be happy to see you.
Okay! Come on, let's go, Shingo!
Okay.
Usagi...
Finished!
Mika, here...
The energy level has peaked! Now, Jumo!
Mika!
Mika!
Usagi, transform now!
Moon Prism Power Makeup!
I'm the sailor warrior of love and justice,
Sailor Moon!
How dare you break the doll Shingo worked so hard to make?!
A doll has all the heart and soul of its creator!
I bet even the dolls for the Girl's Day Festival are upset!
In the name of the moon, I will punish you!
She's incredibly enthusiastic today. I hope she'll be all right.
Oh, no! Help!
I knew it.
You won't escape!
Sailor Moon!
Bubble
Spray!
Oh, saved.
Sailor Moon, are you okay?
We should have come a little later.
Watch out, Sailor Moon!
Not again?!
Begone, Evil Spirits
Begone, Evil Spirits Rin, Pyo, Tou, Sha, Kai, Jin, Retsu, Zai, Zen! Begone, evil spirits!
I can't breathe!
Usagi!

Soul!
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
Your attacks are all useless!
They can cut like knives!
I'm getting an energy reading from the monster's right leg!
Sailor Moon! Aim for the monster's right foot!
Moon Tiara... It's no use! I can't do it!
Who's there?!
Tuxedo Mask!
Now!
Right!
Moon Tiara Action!
What have I been doing?
Shingo!
You're awake.
Oh, Sailor Moon!
I punished the bad monster!
I hope you two get along well together forever.
Sailor Moon rescued us!
Look what happened to the present I made for you...
A present for me?
Um, I'm sorry about what I did the other day.
It's okay. After all, you came to my rescue.
Thank you!
Juban Municipal Primary School
Shingo, this is for what you did for me the other day.
Wow! It looks just like her!
Sailor Moon is just so cool, you know?!
So, you like Sailor Moon that much?!
Oh, that's not what I meant. Wait, Mika!
It's not easy being a popular guy.
