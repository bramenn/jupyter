The seventh floor?!
You almost got yourself killed on the fifth floor not that long ago!
What are you going to do on the seventh?!
How stupid can you be?
B-But I've grown up a lot since then...
And a bunch of my status levels have gone up to E, Eina-san!
What? E? No way...
No way.
Strength and vitality are E.
Agility... D rank?!
Just as you said,
your status has gone way up in a short time.
There are parts of that I can't read,
but your ability is real.
So I'm safe to go to the seventh floor, right?
Yeah, with those status scores,
I have to grant you access to the seventh floor.
But that means the problem is...
Bell-kun, are you free tomorrow?
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Supporter The Weak
Hey, Bell-kun!
Ah, Eina-san!
Good morning!
You're really early, aren't you?
Were you looking forward to shopping with me that much?
No, I...
Well, I was actually looking forward to it, too.
Your armor...
Hey, Bell-kun. Don't you have anything to say about my outfit?
You look a l-lot... a lot younger than usual!
Hey!
I'm still only nineteen!
Come on! Come on!
Please stop!
So where are we going today?
There!
Babel?
Yup.
To the Hephaestus Familia's shop.
I don't have the kind of money it takes
to shop at the Hephaestus Familia's store!
Just come on.
A boy shouldn't keep a girl waiting.
Eina-san!
Yahoo!
Let's go!
I had no idea there was a store like this in Babel.
We're heading for the upper floor,
but this is also part of the Hephaestus Familia's store, so let's stop in.
Thirty million valis?!
What are you looking for today, sir?
Goddess!
Bell-kun!
What are you doing here?!
I noticed you've been really busy lately.
Is it a second part-time job?
Wh-Wh-What about you? What are you doing here, Bell-kun?
And who's this half-elf?
Oh, right, Goddess.
This is...
Hello, Goddess Hestia.
I am Eina Tulle, with the guild.
I'm Bell Cranel's dungeon hunting advisor.
You are, huh?
By the way, Miss Advisor.
You're not trying to use your position to seduce Bell-kun, are you?
I-I try to keep my private life separate from my work!
You have an unusual goddess, don't you?
And here we are!
You think that a high-end brand like the
Hephaestus Familia is outside your reach, right?
Yes.
But that's actually not true.
Here, take a look.
Huh?
It's not that expensive.
Surprised?
All the stuff here is from new blacksmiths.
Even if it's cheap, it's to their advantage to have their
work be sold and evaluated.
And some of them are really good!
Come on, let's go.
I'll go see what's in the back!
Hey, Bell-kun!
Jeez...
It's got the smith's signature.
Welf Crozzo...
How much does it cost?
9,900 valis?
That's almost all I've got on me.
But...
There you are, Bell-kun.
I found something good
Huh?
Eina-san, I'm going to buy this!
You really do like light armor, don't you, Bell-kun?
I-I'm sorry.
It's fine.
You're the one who's going to use it.
If that's your choice, I think it'll be just fine.
Thank you!
So are you going to the dungeon tomorrow?
Yes!
I really wish you could form a party.
At least hire a supporter, maybe?
A supporter?
Yeah, they make things more efficient.
If you want, I can look for one.
I'll think about it.
Thanks for coming with me today.
Oh, right.
Bell-kun, take this.
Wh-What is this?
It's a present from me.
Make sure you use it!
What?! I-I can't accept this!
I wish you would.
For your sake, not mine.
Really, you never know when an adventurer is going to die.
I know lots of adventurers who never came back.
I don't want you to go away.
So maybe it really is for my sake.
And when I saw how hard you were working,
I wanted to help you.
So take it, okay?
Won't you?
Thank you.
It's a little later than I expected.
Are you okay?
You're not getting away anymore,
you damned prum!
Who are you?
Are you with her?
N-No...
I've never seen her?
Then why protect her?
B-Because she's a girl?
What are you saying, you goddamn brat?
Stop it.
You shouldn't be sword fighting in the middle of the city.
Stay out of this.
Get lost, you
Silence.
I don't want to get violent.
I always end up going too far.
Damn it.
Thank you.
You saved me, Ryu-san.
No.
I'm sorry for interfering.
Oh right. That girl...
Huh?
She's gone?
Maybe she got scared and ran?
If you got hurt, Syr would be sad.
Be careful.
R-Right.
I'll be on my way, then.
Thanks, really!
Okay!
Goddess, I'll be going!
Bye.
A supporter, huh?
Mister! Mister! You with the white hair!
Hello, mister!
Sorry to bother you, but are you looking for a supporter?
Hey, you're from...
Are you confused?
But it's actually quite simple.
A poor supporter who wants to pick through the leftovers
of an adventurer is advertising herself!
Th-That's not it...
You're the prum girl from yesterday, right?
Prum?
I'm an animal person.
A chienthrope!
You're right. You're not a prum.
Mister...
S-Sorry!
I guess I was mistaken.
So...
Why did you talk to me, Liliruca-san?
Well, you looked like you were alone.
It's rare to see an adventurer equipped with a backpack, so I thought maybe...
So mister, how about it?
Do you need a supporter?
Well, I was just thinking I'd like to have one.
Really?
Then would you take me, mister?
I'm so poor...
I don't know if I've got enough to get by on right now.
And having a boy touch something so important to me...
You need to take responsibility, don't you?
All right.
Okay, for now, you can be my supporter for the day.
Thank you!
Bell-sama!
Bell-sama, you're so strong!
I can focus on the fight since you're here!
You're amazing!
No, you're much more amazing,
since you can defeat all these monsters by yourself!
Well, I'm sure part of it is because of your weapon.
You might be right.
I think I may rely on this knife a little too much, yeah.
Bell-sama, where'd you get that knife?
The goddess of my familia gave it to me.
Come to think of it, what familia are you with, Lili?
Oh, right, the Soma Familia.
I see.
Anyway, Bell-sama, would you grab his magic stone?
I think it's not too deep in.
I'll grab the ones on the ground.
After that, we'll call it a day.
Yeah.
It's hard to cut...
Huh?
A supporter from the Soma Familia, huh?
Is that a problem?
They're a familia focused on dungeon exploring,
and they also sell some alcohol.
That much is normal, but...
They all seem desperate for some reason.
Like they're pushing themselves to the limit.
Anyway, what did you think, Bell-kun?
About this Liliruca-san.
I think she's great.
Thanks to her, I was able to get all this!
I see.
Then I'm not opposed to it.
The rest is up to you.
In the end, you have to make the decision!
Thank you!
Bye!
Bell-kun?
Yes?
Where's your knife?
Huh? Huh? Huh?
I dropped it?!
Thirty valis.
It can't cut anything.
It's junk.
The blade is dead.
No way!
A weapon that tore through all those monsters without even
getting knicked is only worth thirty valis?
That's impossible!
Stop right there, prum.
Show me the knife that's concealed in your sleeve.
Ryu?
It's similar to one a friend has. I want to check it.
I'm sorry, but this is mine.
You must be mistaken.
Nonsense.
I only know one person with a hieroglyph weapon.
Wh-Where
Ow!
L-Lili!
Bell-sama.
A chienthrope?
Ryu-san...
Syr-san, too!
Oh, right!
Did either of you see a knife that's all black from top to bottom?
The knife is all black
This?
My knife...
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
Cranel-san...
Um... Please...
You should be doing this with Syr, not me.
Ryu, what are you saying?
Here you are, then.
I'm so glad...
I'm sorry, Goddess!
I'll never drop it again.
Drop it?
Yes.
Where did you find it?
I didn't so much find it.
A prum had it.
A prum?
We'll be going, then.
Th-Thank you.
Don't be too much of a brat, okay?
Good timing, though.
I was actually going to look for you.
Um, Lili.
Would you go into the dungeon with me tomorrow?
Bell-sama...
Thank you for hiring me.
By the way, Bell-sama, I don't see that knife of yours.
Yeah.
I put it in here, so I won't drop it again.
Did you?
Anyway, you sure you don't want any money for the contract?
Yes. Since you're alone, distributing the loot isn't that complicated.
And...
And?
That's better for you, too, isn't it?
Okay, let's go!
If you do your best, there'll be no problem at all!
Y-Yeah...
How far should we go today?
Let me see...
26,000 valis?!
It's not a dream, right?
All this money!
Wow, Bell-sama!
You made more than a five-man party of Level 1 adventurers all by yourself!
Well, they say if you praise a rabbit, it'll climb a tree!
That must be it!
I have no idea what that means,
but I'll join in!
Wow!
And we can keep getting better!
Okay, Bell-sama. Let's split the loot.
Oh, right.
Maybe I can get my goddess something good to eat with this.
Um, this is...
Oh, right. Lili, do you want to go get something to eat?
Bell-sama?
Why are we splitting it evenly?
Aren't you going to try and take it all for yourself?
Huh? Why?
I never could have earned this much on my own.
It was because you were there.
It's all thanks to you, Lili.
Let's keep working together!
You're weird.
Just 12,000 valis?
What's wrong with you?
Are you blind?
See? Again.
Another Soma Familia adventurer.
Damn it all...
The Soma Familia, huh?
Is Bell-kun going to be okay?
It's here...
Riveria, don't interfere.
This is no good...
I was going to just watch him for a while.
But I just want to play with you.
You're going to show me the power that sleeps within you.
I made it through another day.
Even if it's to repay that loan...
I'm a goddess and she's still so harsh.
I can't wait to see Bell-kun.
It's Bell-kun!
No!
Bell-kun, you cheater!
