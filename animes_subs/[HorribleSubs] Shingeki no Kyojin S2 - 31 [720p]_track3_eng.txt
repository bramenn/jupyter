Again?!
What the hell is that sound?!
While stopped at the ruins of Utgard Castle to take a brief break,
the Scouts were overwhelmed by a Titan assault, vanquishing their hope of survival.
-Nanaba... -No! No!
-And Gelgar... -No! No!
Father, stop!
However, in that moment...
Christa.
This is nothing more than a hope of mine...
I want you... to live a life you're proud of.
Ymir! Wait!
Keep it up, Ymir!
Want live...?
Grab me!
This looks bad.
Ymir is...
This can't...
This can't...
I still haven't told you my real name!
And then the main force of the Scouts rushed in to engage the enemy.
Die!
They successfully dismantled the Titan attack.
However,
upon the ruins of battle,
Eren and the others learn a surprising truth.
Ymir...
My real name...
Warrior
Slowly!
Bring it up slowly!
Raise it carefully now!
How's Ymir?
What sort of shape is she in?
Her right arm and leg were bitten off,
and her insides are beaten like scrambled eggs.
If she was normal, she'd be dead for sure.
If she was normal, huh?
Reiner! Grab on!
Right!
Please, believe me!
I'm telling the truth!
Ymir transformed into a Titan to fight off the other Titans and save us!
She did so with no regard for her own life,
which proves her loyalty to us, her comrades!
It's true that her judgement until now is unforgivable.
After all, she may know things useful to humanity and yet she kept quiet about it!
I imagine she didn't say anything in order to protect herself.
But... now she's a changed person!
Ymir is an ally of humanity!
I know Ymir better than anybody.
She's a much simpler person than she looks!
I see.
Obviously, I hope we can build a trusting relationship with her.
Her judgement aside, the information she holds is a treasure for humanity.
I hope we get along.
But you know...
this world becomes more of a confusing mess with every passing day.
You said... your real name was Historia Reiss?
Yes, that's right.
Reiss, as in that noble family?
Yes.
I see.
Nice to meet you, Historia.
Yeah...
How's Ymir?
She's still in a coma.
Her bleeding has stopped, and we think steam is coming out of her wounds.
For now, take her back to Trost so she can get some proper medical care.
She's in your hands.
Understood.
Now then...
Our original mission... was to seal this wall.
Damn, it hurts.
You all right, Reiner?
Not by a long shot.
A Titan nearly gnawed off my arm.
That was... pathetic.
I thought I was done for.
Even someone as strong as you gets this way sometimes.
What are you talking about? This is the second time for me!
Tell him, Armin.
Huh?
Remember the time I almost got crushed in that Titan's hand?
Oh...
Back then...
That makes twice I've nearly died.
At this rate, I'll be dead before I know it.
I picked this path on my own, but being a soldier is rough.
It's like a soldier's spirit breaks down before their body.
Though, until we plug up this wall,
there's no time to waste whining about it.
Yeah.
You two have been driven far enough away from your hometown.
I'm thinking... this is where we gotta draw the line.
He's right, Reiner!
Our hometown! Let's return!
Isn't it about time to go back?
Compared to all the trouble we've been through, what's left to do is nothing!
That's right.
We're so close, it's just another few steps till the end.
Huh?
What are you guys talking about?
Thanks, Mikasa.
Are you hurt?
I'm fine, but... Reiner got his arm bit and Ymir is as you can see.
Who would've thought Ymir was a Titan, too?
Does that-?
Sasha.
Is everyone clear?
We'll deal with Ymir later.
And Conny...
I'll arrange for a Scout squad to investigate your village later.
For the time being, I want you to focus on the mission to fix the wall.
Got it?
Got it!
Still... I expected this place to be swarming with Titans.
Hannes?
It's the Garrison's advance squad.
They came to tell us where the hole is.
There's no hole anywhere!
Huh?
We spent all night looking for it...
What'd you say?
We bumped into soldiers from Krolva and retraced our steps.
We haven't seen any Titans the whole way here.
But... we know for sure there's Titans on this side of the wall.
Did you actually look? Are you sure you're not drunk?
I didn't drink!
Wait, why are all of you here anyways?
If there's no hole in the wall, so be it.
For now, we're falling back to Trost District!
Whatever you do, don't let your guard down.
We're going back ahead of you.
There's nothing wrong with the wall?
What could this mean?
There's been nothing like this in five years. Why is it all happening now?
This world is getting more and more out of hand.
Eren.
Have a minute?
We need to talk.
What about?
Five years ago, we demolished the wall and began our attack on humanity.
Oh no... What if there's a Titan that dug a hole underneath the wall?
The hole will be hard to find in that case.
I'm the Armored Titan and he's the Colossal Titan.
Right now, we need to focus on getting Ymir back safely.
Even with our horses, we still have to worry about Titans.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Why are you telling him, Reiner?
Our primary goal was to ensure all of humanity was wiped out,
but now there's no need for that.
Uh...
Eren.
If you agree to come with us, we won't have to destroy any more of the walls.
Understand?
Huh?
No, wait! I don't understand at all!
I'm saying... Why don't you just come with us?
Information Available for Public Disclosure Lifts
Lifts are used to carry objects and materials over the walls. They are easily transported and assembled and are built in such a way to facilitate emergency and tactical deployment. Their weight is minimized for this purpose.
I know this is sudden, but we need to go now.
Right now? Where will you take me?
I can't say that yet.
But... Well, it's something like our hometown.
So? What will it be, Eren?
Uh...
It's not a bad deal, right?
You can easily avert this crisis.
I wonder about that...
Hey! We're leaving!
What the hell?
And here I thought I had enough to think about yesterday...
12 hours earlier
Eren?
Ehrmich District
What is it, Section Commander?
Oh, well...
I was finally able to get my hands on the background report for Annie Leonhart.
Annie's?
Yeah.
It's taken so long to get it because managing these reports is such a mess right now.
According to this,
there were two others belonging to the
104th Cadet Corps who came from the same area as her.
And those two are...
Thanks to the chaos five years ago,
pretty much all of their family records are spotty or missing.
However...
During the long-range scouting formation, their unit was given false information.
They were among those purposely told that Eren was in the right wing.
The Female Titan attacked from the right wing!
Huh? What does that mean?
That it's possible they passed on that information to Annie...
Why? Why would they tell Annie?
Hey, hold on a minute, Armin.
You can't just-
I know that, Eren.
By itself, that's not enough to prove anything.
So just in case, I'd like to hear from you how these three interacted during training.
Know anything?
I knew Reiner and Bertholdt were from the same place, but...
I agree.
I don't recall ever seeing the pair talking to Annie that much.
Well, Annie didn't talk much in the first place.
When we ate, Annie would always sit alone and munch on food by herself.
Oh! I've got something!
I heard a rumor she liked sweets, even though she looks so grouchy!
don't remember.
But...
As their comrade, I'd find it hard to believe.
Set aside Bertholdt, who doesn't say much.
Reiner is like everyone's big brother, and he's not devious enough to deceive all of us.
I agree.
Reiner gave everything he had fighting the Female Titan with me.
He would have gotten crushed in her hand if he hadn't-
What's wrong?
Reiner managed to escape, but...
I did mention that Eren might be at the rear of the center rank.
But Annie was too far away to hear...
Seriously?
Did Reiner seem overly interested in Eren's location?
Then... Where the hell is Eren?
It can't be...
I only started talking about Eren's position...
Furthermore...
He might have written a message with his blades in her hand.
Reiner could've...
What the hell?
Why are you saying things like this?
-You should-
-Eren! -You should-
No... Everyone, listen up!
Supposing that we find Reiner or Bertholdt,
act in such a way as to not reveal any suspicions.
Of course, do not make any mention of Annie Leonhart either.
Regardless if they're Annie's accomplices or not,
we need to lead them deep underground and confine them.
Does everyone understand?
Yes!
You're just tired, aren't you?
Right, Bertholdt?
You've been through so much, it's making you crazy.
Y-Yeah.
Reiner's just really tired.
Besides, if you were really the Armored Titan that wants to destroy humanity...
What did you think would happen? That I'd nod and say Sure, let's go?
Oh, right.
That's right.
What the hell was I thinking?
Have I really gone crazy?
Come on, let's go.
I see...
That's it.
I've been here too long for my own good.
It's been three long years...
surrounded by nothing but idiots.
We were just kids... We didn't know anything.
If only I never knew that there were people like this...
It's too late now... I don't know what's right anymore.
But the only choice for me now...
Reiner!
Are we doing it?! Now?! Right here?!
Yeah.
We settle this... right here, right now!
Eren!
Run!
Bertholdt!
Eren! Get out of there!
Ymir!
Eren!
I'm going to return to the hometown we lost.
That's all I care about now.
Bertholdt...
Reiner...
You damn traitors!
The Colossal Titan...
If their mission is to exterminate all of humanity, there is no turning back for them now.
Reiner and the others devote their lives to the mission...
