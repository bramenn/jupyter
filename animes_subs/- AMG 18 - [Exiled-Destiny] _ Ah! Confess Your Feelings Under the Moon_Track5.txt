Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
It's good to be by the sea...
At the seaside, man and woman are freed from the curse of daily life...
That goes for man and goddess, too.
Keiichi! That goes for man and goddess, too.
Keiichi!
Hey there!
Thanks, Megumi. I owe all this to you.
I just told you, I'm right at the good part now!
You're always hogging the TV, every single day!
I won't let you get away with it today!
Won't let me? I won't let you get away with it today!
And how do you intend to stop me?
I don't know, but you're not getting away with this!
Oh yeah? Then bring it on!
Really, those two!
So, how are you getting along with Belldandy these days?
If you're so concerned, then maybe you shouldn't come barging in...
Now, now, lighten up, will you?
I really don't mind at all.
The more people at the table, the better, you know...
I see I have no choice! Kei-chan, these are for you.
For a hotel? But where did you get these?
I got them at the shopping arcade. I want to thank you for breakfast.
Why don't you take a trip with Belldandy?
Megumi...
But those certificates were given to you, Megumi... are you really sure?
It doesn't look like I can take the time off, see...in other words...
You know what I'm talking about! Right, Kei-chan?
You really should make the most of this and go...just the two of you!
Just the two of us?
You'll never get anywhere unless you drop that grammar-school mentality.
This is your chance to go all the way... get the job done! Got it?
A-a-all the way?
Um...
Go all the way and get what job done?
Huh?
Here, under the blue skies...
At this moment, I'm on cloud 9!
But the thing is, Megumi...
We didn't get to be alone at all.
Yay! We didn't get to be alone at all.
Ah! Confess Your Love Under the Moon?
Keiichi, I hope you understand what it means to be by the sea.
What are you talking about?
We're here by the sea! What are you talking about?
There's no better chance for a man and a woman to open their minds and souls...
Then you shouldn't have tagged along.
Keiichi!
Keiichi, aren't you going to swim?
Oh, but you know what, I can't swim, you see...
Hey, really? Then I'm going to lend you something that'll help.
A Banpei robot equipped with marine parts...
I call him Blue Six!
How the heck did you bring this thing here?
So don't worry about not being able to swim.
You can steer it with this remote control.
Wait a minute, what about you, Skuld?
I bet the real reason you brought this here is because you can't swim yourself!
Keiichi!
You should've just kept your big mouth shut.
Are you all right, Keiichi?
Oh, right, I got thrown into the ocean, and...
Thank goodness you're safe!
SAHARA
Hey, I'm fine, I'm fine! You don't have to worry about me!
Darn that spineless fool!
But it's so lovely here, don't you think?
The sea is so beautiful.
Yeah, if only those two weren't around, it would be paradise.
Keiichi?
Huh?
You look so tired.
Oh, uh, the thing is...
Isn't there anything I can do for you?
I'll do anything, if it'll help you to feel better, Keiichi.
No, that's all right.
Just sitting and looking at the scenery with you is enough to make me happy.
What?
Looking at the sea you love so much...
Keiichi!
Belldandy...
All right, now's your chance! Just do it!
That's as far as you go!
Just when it was getting really good...
Please free to bathe at any time.
Oh! But that's it, Keiichi!
Whenever one is weary...
Take a bath?
Mixed Bath
In a mixed bath?! Mixed Bath
In a mixed bath?!
Ah, no, no, no!
What's the matter?
I have to get mentally prepared for this...
You need to be mentally prepared to take a bath?
I mean, since it's a mixed bath, okay?
Is it wrong, perhaps?
No, no, it's not wrong, but...
All right, then please come in when you're mentally prepared!
'Please come in,' did she say?
But are we really at that level in our relationship?
We're barely even really held hands yet, never mind kissed.
I mean, before we start taking baths together...
No, but this is a mixed bath, after all.
There's nothing wrong with me taking a bath with Belldandy here...
And anyway, Belldandy said it was all right!
If I let this chance slip away, I might never get another!
Ahhh, what a lovely bath.
Well, hello, Skuld!
Where's Keiichi?
He's over...
Men's Bath
I'm such a loser. Megumi... Men's Bath
I'm such a loser. Megumi...
Hey...if it were you, would you have gone?
I can't wait until I'm just like you, Big Sister!
Oh, you've still got a lot of growing up to do, so don't worry,
Really? Do you think I'll be just like you?
Oh, more attractive than I am!
For real? You mean here, too? Oh, more attractive than I am!
Oh, my! What are you doing?
Your skin is so soft and smooth, Big Sister!
Stop it, Skuld, don't touch me there... You're tickling me!
So am I really going to look like this? I just can't wait!
This in itself is intense enough...
Does it bug you that much?
Urd?! Hey, this is the men's bath!
Never mind that, why didn't you take a bath with Belldandy?
Well, because...
Can't you see that you're only making...
That might be true, but...
At this rate, you'll never get a kiss, and forget about getting her to be your girlfriend!
But...
More likely, she'll just get disgusted with you and go home to Heaven!
But no...she can't!
All right, then, climb over!
The only thing that's standing between you two is that flimsy wooden wall!
That's going too far!
Are you going to just let it slide? Unless you climb that wall...
But I can't just all of a sudden...
Never mind, just go!
Or else I'm going to punish you!
Hey, wait a minute, that's way too harsh!
You're driving me mad! It's nothing but wood! All right, take that!
BATH
I wonder what that sound was just now?
Beats me.
Sorry, Megumi.
Your big brother is a loser.
It's just too big an order for me to have to go all the way.
Keiichi, if you don't act fast, nothing will come of this trip.
Urd...
The thing about girls is...even if they know the guy's in love with them...
Here, take a look at this.
Sea cucumbers, right?
That's right, sea cucumbers.
Are they for dinner?
No, certainly not! Are they for dinner?
They're for fortune-telling! Echinoderm fortune-telling.
My reading tells me that the moon is protecting your primary star and...
Understand?
Not one word...
Man! Listen...
See how 3 sea cucumbers are lined up nice and cozy, in a vertical row?
They're symbolizing your destined place...
Destined place?
Yes!
Somewhere on this beach, there's a place that looks just that.
And tonight, if you confess your love under the full moon...
Forever? You mean, Belldandy and me?
Yes, forever!
It's written in the stars... it's your fate...
Destiny?
Of course, whether you want to believe that or not is up to you.
Well, just let me know if you ever need my help!
Sure, 3 sea cucumbers all lined up somewhere...
I don't see anything like that anywhere!
Destiny? No way am I ever going to let Keiichi confess his love to Big Sister!
Yes, forever!
It's written in the stars... it's your fate...
Joined forever, huh?
Okay!
Keiichi.
Don't take this personally, but I just can't hand over my Big Sister to you!
Bring it on if you're up to it! But I'll be coming right back at you!
But wait a second... where the heck is my lookout?
She never knows when to quit, does she?
Oh well, I suppose this must be part of the challenge...
But once you've overcome this ordeal, Keiichi, true love will be waiting for you!
If push comes to shove, I promise I'll be there for you.
It's very quiet, isn't it?
Uh, yeah.
I wonder where those two have wandered off to?
It's getting so late.
Yeah, you're right.
Keiichi, are you wishing you'd never come to the sea with me, perhaps?
No, no, I'm not!
I wanted to come here with you.
But you seem to be brooding over something, so I thought...
That's because...
Sorry!
Listen, I'm going to go out for a while.
Keiichi...
But...but that's...
That looks like 3 sea cucumbers lined up vertically, nice and cozy!
I see, they're visible now because the tide's out.
If I confess my feelings up there on the night of the full moon...
What...what's the matter?
My chest...my chest started hurting all of a sudden...
What am I supposed to do, Megumi? I've got to go back as soon as possible...
If I start back right away, I know I'll get there in time!
Thank you...
He fell right into my trap, huh?
She weighs a ton! But that's not possible...
It happens to be a Magnetic Control Unit, a mannequin made of iron filings.
Looks like it's all you can do to inch forward, with your puny strength!
I knew it wouldn't take long for Mr. Nice Guy Keiichi to fall for it!
Could my strategy be more perfect?
Sorry!
Are you all right?
Hey, what's up with that?
No good! I'm busted! All right, no choice!
Self-destruct!
Only Skuld could be so efficient and yet so undisciplined...
Is she afraid I'm going to take Belldandy away from her?
Well, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna make it on my own!
Ouch, ouch, ouch...
I never thought he'd fall for that one so easily.
Now that I think of it, there's no way that Keiichi can get there anyway.
Oh, well, now I can rest easy.
Okay, I'm heading back!
Belldandy!
Keiichi!
What in the world happened to you? Just look at you!
Oh...it's nothing really.
Keiichi, what on earth happened?
The moon looks beautiful tonight. Want to go take a look?
But first we should take care of your injuries...
Oh, I'm fine.
Anyway, there's something more important than that.
Oh, man...
Bringing her here was one thing, but how the heck am I gonna get us over there?
Keiichi, what should I do now?
Isn't there anything I can do to help you?
Why oh why can't I swim, now of all times?
Megumi...isn't there a way I can pull this off?
I'm so close!
Didn't I tell you if you were in trouble, you only had to call out to...
Me, the great Urd!
Urd!
Hey! My Blue Six is gone!
Well! You only just got here now?
You took my Blue Six, didn't you?
That's right.
Where are those two?
Over there!
Hang on tight, now! We're almost there!
Over my dead body! Crash-dive mode!
What's going on?
Darn, we're so close now!
I'm going to make it there somehow and tell Belldandy how I...
Keiichi!
Keiichi, are you all right?
Sorry! You had to rescue me again...
I'm so pathetic...
You most certainly are not!
Because, Keiichi...
That's what I love about you, Keiichi!
Belldandy...
Thank you.
Hey! Now they're like, getting all romantic!
I've got to do something or Keiichi will declare his love!
Well, like I said, that's their destiny!
Now that they've gotten this far, stop fighting it and just leave them alone.
No way!
Big Sister belongs to me and me alone!
Really, Skuld...
You're always changing the negative to a positive...
That's what always rescues me, you know...your smiling face...
And that's why I...
Oh.
Huh?
Oh, my...
F-forever...
Congratulations! Congratulations!
It didn't work out after all, Megumi...
No! Keiichi!
Both of you, pull yourselves together!
Kei-chan, how was your trip?
Kei-chan?
I'm nothing but a loser, Megumi...
I have no spine, I have no guts, and I don't seem to have any luck, either!
Why do I have to be with Keiichi of all people?
I didn't think they'd believe my story!
Why oh why? I didn't think they'd believe my story!
Forgive me, I'm a worthless big brother...
What the heck happened?! Forgive me, I'm a worthless big brother...
What the heck happened?!
'And that's why I love you', he said...
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a Wing!
I love you so much it hurts...
And it hurts me that I can't tell you how I feel.
You and I have matching hearts...
So we must share the same scars deep down inside.
But now that I'm in your arms, I think I can catch...
Nobody else matters... All we have to do is gaze at each other.
It's all right for your heart to flutter... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
Don't run away from happiness.
I'll always be waiting for you.
So come rest your wings anytime.
It's all right to cry... anytime you need to.
I just want to see you again... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
I just want you to be happy.
The seeds of love... a magic potion that will make you irresistible to all.
When this is taken by a goddess, her hidden feelings come flooding out.
