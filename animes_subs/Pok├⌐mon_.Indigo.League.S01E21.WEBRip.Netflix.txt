So now, time for us to play.
Ash and his friends continue their journey.
As they pass through a dark and mysterious forest,
it seems that danger lurks behind every shadow.
And once again, they've lost their way.
So this is the way to Saffron City, huh, Misty?
I knew we shouldn't have listened to you. Now we'll never get out of here.
As if. Your sense of direction's so bad, you can't find yourself in a mirror.
-You crack mirrors. -You big baby.
That's enough, guys. You two don't want to stand here
and insult each other like this.
Yes, we do.
Bad enough we're lost. If I've got to listen to your arguing...
Uh, hello? Do you live around here?
Hey, please don't run away.
Wait! We need directions.
Wait, ah!
Bulbasaur!
- Ash, are you okay? -Yeah!
Phew, that was close.
Hey, what about that weird little girl? Where'd she run off to?
Beats me, but take a look over there.
-Oh. - Oh, wow, it's beautiful.
Saffron City.
Sabrina's the Gym Leader of the Saffron City gym.
You defeat her, you win a marsh badge.
Yes! Look out, Sabrina. Here I come.
Abra and the Psychic Showdown
- Now this is what I call a city. - Yeah.
This must be some kind of ambush.
Huh?
Congratulations, winners.
Winners? There's something real fishy about this.
Why should we win something just for walking into town?
There's a simple explanation.
It just so happens that you're the millionth,
millionth and first, millionth and second
and millionth and third visitors to Saffron City.
J Saffron City The city you love to visit J
Oh, boy! It looks like our luck is starting to turn good.
Right this way to the grand prize room.
Please step lively.
Thank you for your, Pikachu.
Huh?
-Hey, you can't take Pi- -You've won a trip through the warp tile.
- -That was easy.
What's going on here?
If this is the grand prize room, then where are all the prizes?
Can't you put two and two together? The only thing we've won is this trap.
Oh.
There aren't any doors or windows in this room.
Bingo. The warp tile is the only way in or out of this room.
There's no way to escape.
What are you talking about?
Good evening. You're watching the premiere
Prepare for Trouble, Make it Double show.
It's Team Rocket!
Ew, gross, they both kissed me! Blah! Blah! Blah! Blah!
-To protect the world from devastation. -To unite all peoples within our nation.
-To denounce the evils of truth and love. -To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie. -James.
Hey, don't sit there ignoring us.
-Their show is pretty boring. -It'll get canceled pretty soon.
We're boring?
Just you wait. We have something that'll grab their attention.
Because now it's time for our special guest's...
Farewell performance.
You better give Pikachu back right now.
Hey! Where you going? Turn it back on.
-James, something's wrong. -Turn it on!
We can't. Nothing's working.
That's what happens when you work with amateurs. Huh?
Hey, you guys!
Can't you see we're a little busy right now?
-Yeah, but who's the kid? -Huh?
How did you get into this room, little girl? You don't belong in here.
You can't just come barging in here.
-Oh! I can't move! I'm frozen. -Ah! So am I.
You want me to turn down the air conditioning?
- James, I can't move. - Me neither.
Team Rocket, give me back Pikachu.
- - Huh?
Pikachu!
So, it's you again.
-Are you the one who saved Pikachu? -Uh-huh.
Thank you. I owe you one.
We better watch out. That's no ordinary little girl.
So, what is she then?
Hey, what's going on?
How'd we wind up back outside again?
That little girl must have done something to get us out of there.
We should be okay as long as we don't have to win anymore prizes.
Huh?
What's that?
You've come to Saffron City and you don't even know Sabrina's Gym?
So that's Sabrina's Gym.
If you're trying to enter the Pokemon league, young man,
this is one gym I suggest you stay away from.
Huh? But why? Ah!
Where's he going?
I've got to compete here.
Without a Marsh Badge, I can't get into the Pokemon league.
Anyone here?
That's weird. Everyone's gone.
Hello?
There's something creepy about this place.
Hmm?
-A circle. -A star.
Oh!
Whoa, what kind of place is this?
What are you kids doing here?
We've come to ask for a Pokemon match to earn a Marsh Badge.
-You want to challenge the great Sabrina? -Sure do.
Uh, excuse me, but what are all those people doing in that room?
Hmm, you know so little, yet you wish to challenge the great Sabrina?
-Heh. - Huh?
Is something wrong? You look like you've got a headache.
Fool. It's Telekinesis.
You can't control a psychic-type Pokemon without using Telekinetic powers.
Hmm, that's what you think.
Telekinesis is okay, but I have my own secret method for bending spoons.
Ah!
Muscle over mind.
-Embarrassing. -Just pretend we never met him before.
Pika. Pi.
Now hurry up and take us to Sabrina so we can start the match.
Heh, as you wish.
Here we are.
Huh?
This is more like some kind of temple than a Pokemon gym.
Whatever it's like, I don't like it.
Oh, great Sabrina, these strangers have come
who wish to challenge you.
Though I don't know why you'd waste your time on this group of losers.
Whoa!
It's the little girl who brought back Pikachu.
Forgive me, great one. It's not my place to decide whom you battle.
I told you there was something really strange about her.
-Right, but who is she? -Are you really Sabrina?
Sabrina, I demand an official match to compete for a Marsh Badge.
Mm-hmm. I'd like to have a match.
Well, that was easy.
- But if you lose... - Huh?
Uh, be your friends? Uh, okay, you bet.
You both got to have a little more faith in me.
Even if she does have some Telekinetic powers,
she's still only a little girl.
Ah, just don't let your guard down, Ash.
Huh?
So now, time for us to play.
So you are really Sabrina, The Gym Leader.
One-on-one. An all-out match. Agreed?
Agreed.
Come now, Abra.
Go get him, Pikachu.
Pikachu!
Pi?
Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pi.
Pika. Pi. Pikachu.
I don't get it. Nobody sends a sleeping Pokemon into a match.
Maybe she's making fun of me.
Abra, a psychic power Pokemon.
It sleeps 18 hours a day but employs telekinesis even while sleeping.
-Telekinesis? -Be careful.
No problem. Pikachu, Thunder Shock!
Pi!
Pikaaa-chu!
Pi? Pika?
Pika!
Whoa!
It teleported itself.
Childish fools.
-Kadabra. -Cha!
What's that?
Kadabra, a psychic Pokemon.
The evolved form of Abra.
Employs powerful telekinetic attacks.
That isn't fair. I thought this was one-on-one.
But evolving during a match isn't against any rules.
Be careful. Kadabra is really powerful.
This time, you won't get away from Pikachu.
It's against the rules to leave a stadium, even by teleportation.
Pikachu, fill up this whole stadium with lightning.
Hit them with your best shock.
Pika... chu!
-Kadabra. -Pi?
-Now what? -Confusion.
-Pikachu! -Psychic attack.
- -Kadabra.
That's right, Pikachu, don't give up.
Pika. Pikachu. Pika.
Heh, look at that. Pikachu feels like dancing.
That's no dance. Kadabra's using its psychic powers to control Pikachu's body.
-Huh? -Pika, Pikachu.
-Kadabra. -
Pikachu!
-Oh, Pikachu! -Cha!
That's it. Stop the match!
Pikachu. Are you all right?
-I forfeit. -Be my friends.
You promised I could play with you.
Huh?
Now where are we?
Ah, looks like we've been teleported again.
Sabrina must've teleported us from the Pokemon Gym.
This place is empty.
-I'll take a look around. -We'll come with you, Ash.
Is anybody home?
Please, can somebody help us?
Hey.
-That cake looks delicious. -Ah!
Sabrina wanted to play with us but I guess we're going to have lunch first.
I wonder where she is.
Guess it's rude not to wait for her but I can't resist.
-Ah! This stupid cake is fake! -Huh?
Now what's in here? Oh!
Oh, I'm very sorry. I really didn't think that anybody was home. I just...
-Huh? -Pika, Pikachu.
Hmm?
Huh? Something's not right here.
That thing is a doll.
Ash, you're not going to believe this, but we're inside a doll house.
This is a doll house?
Everything in here is made out of plastic, including the food.
How can that be?
Now I can play with you all.
Wow, she's pretty tall for a little girl.
Actually, I think we're the ones who got a lot smaller.
Run for it.
How can we get away from her?
The houses, the streets, they're all her toys.
-That means we're... -That means we're trapped!
Trapped inside her toy box.
Must have shrunk us with telekinesis.
So when she said she wanted to play with us, she really meant it.
- Huh? -It's a dead end.
What's that?
-She's coming this way. -Uh-oh.
We're going to have a ball.
I want to play catch.
We're going to get squashed.
Listen. Let your minds rely on mine.
Teleportation.
That was fun. Let's play again sometime.
-Now what? -This is a real place.
Ha, we made it.
- There's that guy. -Thanks for the help.
But why did you decide to rescue us?
Sabrina is a dangerous Pokemon trainer.
I got the chance to help you this time, but next time, you won't be so lucky.
You'll all be trapped in her toy box for eternity.
Huh?
Give up your crazy idea of challenging Sabrina.
Leave Saffron City and never come back here.
I can't do that. I have to win Sabrina's Marsh Badge
so I'll be able to get into the Pokemon League.
You will never be able to defeat Sabrina and her psychic Pokemon.
Yes, I will. We just need to make a quicker attack
before she can kick in with her psychic powers.
Hmm?
-Ash what do you think you're doing? -It's not me. My body's moving by itself.
Heh, if you can't beat me, you haven't got a chance against Sabrina.
What do you mean? Can you use telekinesis too?
Please teach me how to use psychic powers.
Argh! Ugh.
Whoa!
You usually have to be born with telekinetic powers.
-You can't just learn them. -Please wait.
Just forget about it, Ash.
You haven't got a chance against telekinesis.
I may not have telekinesis
but I've still got the guts to take on Sabrina again.
Whoa!
Wise up, kid. Not even I have the powers to defeat Sabrina.
Guts don't count in this contest. I'm telling you this for your own good.
-Don't, Ash. -Better call it quits, Ash.
-Ash, give it up. -Please.
I need your help.
I've got to defeat Sabrina for the Marsh Badge. I have to.
You've got to help me beat her.
Please show me how. Ugh.
Well, that's one determined kid. Hmm.
There just may be one way you can defeat her.
Huh?
Only one other type of Pokemon can battle the psychic type.
If you capture a ghost Pokemon from Lavender Town,
you might have a chance.
A ghost Pokemon from Lavender Town. Thank you.
Hm.
-Ash. Hey, Ash. -Ash!
Uh, are you okay?
You haven't got a chance against a psychic Pokemon.
Ha. Let's go. On to Lavender Town.
With some luck, that kid may be the one who can rescue Sabrina.
Who is this mysterious bearded man?
And what's the secret of the Pokemon trainer Sabrina?
Will Ash have what it takes to capture a ghost Pokemon in Lavender Town?
Only the future will tell us and that's exactly where our heroes are headed.
Still can't move a muscle, huh?
-We're paralyzed. -Now I know how a statue feels.
Meowth. This is getting to be a real drag.
Maybe we should call the psychic hotline.
You guys up for the Pokerap?
There's 150 Pokemon. You gotta name'em all!
I'm doing 32 today, so try to keep up.
