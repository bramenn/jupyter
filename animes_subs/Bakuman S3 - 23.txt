There go her dreams.
Good morning.
Good morning.
My goodness... Sit properly while you eat, won't you?
That's bad manners.
There's a number of news items to discuss this morning,
but this is the headline that caught my attention.
The miraculous pure love of voice actress, Azukyun
Listeners Cry Over her Purity of Love
Fans of Azukyun shed farewell tears over her marriage announcement
Her boyfriend, the popular manga artist Mashiro Moritaka (24), also called live on the phone
Revelation on the Radio
and her confession over the radio.

The promise they made in middle school not to meet until their dreams were granted
She's a pretty girl, isn't she?
I-I'm going to work.
That's pretty early for you.
It's only 8 o'clock.
I have to do some stuff first, so I'll be late if I don't go now.
Thanks for breakfast.
Moritaka.
I'm not against it.
Against what?
Your marriage with Miho.
M-Mom!
I won't oppose it either.
N-Not you too, Grandpa!
Don't tease me!
I'm not.
You've become a real man, a proper hardworking member of society.
Marriage, huh?

Mic and Script
I was surprised too.
It was all over the news when I turned on the TV this morning.
And they called it a pure relationship, right?
Too pure, maybe.
You're right.
Hey, Saikou.
What?! Enough about the news already
That's not it.

Miho's rank went up!
I was worried for a while there, but it looks like last night's broadcast had a positive effect.
Yeah, that must be it!
Miho managed to get her sincerity across to everyone.
Also, it's good for us that normal people now know about this story.
Even if she does get picked for the part in Reversi,
they'll support her, just like they did on the news today.
Yup!
Can we really say that she got the job with her own skill if that happens, though?
She's taking the audition, so no problem there.
Ohtsuki Nanami
Azuki Miho
Majima Saki
Tanaka Mikan
But based on her popularity and skills, and the buzz surrounding her,
Azuki's bound to get the part.
You're overthinking this.
Thanks to Azuki Miho, Reversi has an amazing amount of attention on it right now.
We should be able to hit the ground running.
Konaka.
Yes?
Satoru, you've changed.
You used to be more kind.
You just went along with it?
Ashirogi Mutou
We're going to hold auditions for the role of Naho and choose the most suitable voice actress, correct?
Of course we're having auditions!
But at this rate, it's practically been decided already.
REVERSI storyboard
All right, your manuscript looks good.
Thanks.

Great!
With this, you're selling about 830,000 copies per volume.
Just one more push until you reach Zombie Gun's number of 1.05 million!
Right!
Anime Adaptation
Confirmed!
Ashirogi Mutou
You really do get more attention when you have an upcoming anime.
There's that, but recent radio broadcasts have brought about a lot of positive attention.
By radio broadcasts, were you talking about Azuki's?
Yeah.
It seems that there's something in you two that makes you stronger with each hardship you face.
You're exaggerating.
These two really are something else.
No, Azuki's strength is here, too.
They'll definitely move forward and achieve their dreams.
Right, Hattori?
Wh-What's wrong?
Uh, nothing.
At this rate, becoming Jack's flagship may not be just a dream.
That's what I was thinking.
Really?
Yeah.
The true flagship, huh?
Finally things are going our way!
I'll say.
Right. Everything's going our way now,
so Azuki will definitely get the role of Naho.
Anime Adaptation
Confirmed!
Congrats!
Congrats!
Ashirogi Mutou
Fair and square, by audition.
Well, I have to attend a meeting with the anime staff.
At this hour?
Apparently there's something urgent they need to make a decision on.
Urgent?
Is there some kind of problem?
It's not that big of a deal.
I'll call you as soon as it's over.
And that's our proposal.
It's a pretty drastic one.
Director Ehara has insisted that you let us proceed with this if at all possible.
B-But we can't decide on this without Ashirogi's input.
Of course.
Hattori, I'll leave the arrangements for that in your hands.
Huh?!
A public audition for the role of Naho?
Yes.
We'd like to hold a public audition for the role of Naho on the TV and Internet.
But why?
I proposed it.
First, we will narrow down the candidates to 20 possible choices.
We'll then hold the public audition,
broadcasting it live on TV and the Internet simultaneously,
and allow viewers to have one vote each in a poll that will decide who will play Naho.
They can't do that!
Azuki definitely won't get the role that way!
Why?
There are still many critical opinions of her on the Internet.
That's even more true of the hardcore Azuki fans. They won't vote for her.
I also have my doubts as to whether this is necessary.
You mean, they won't vote based on her abilities.
No, that's precisely why we must do this.
Upon hearing that radio broadcast, I too was touched by your mindset.
In this situation, even if Azuki Miho wins the role through her skill alone,
in most people's minds, the audition will merely be a formality.
That can't be!
I see.
This is what has been bothering me.
If we simply ride the changing tide of public opinion...
Mashiro, I...
will pass the audition.
Even so, I...
There's nobody who wants Azuki Miho to play the role of Naho more than me.
And there's nothing I want more than for her to get the role by her skills alone.
If you say that skill will be the only thing judged at these public auditions,
then I'll agree to it.
I'm telling you, there's a possibility they won't vote on skill alone.
That's right, Mashiro. You should think carefully about this.
No matter the result,
it's still better than people saying that Azuki got the role through her connections.
Though there may be voice actresses who surpass her in popularity and skill,
Azuki will rise above them.
No... If she doesn't rise above them, then she doesn't have what it takes to play Naho!
They said it's a public audition.

Oh, good.
Hey, don't look at such misleading stuff!
Okay. I'm sorry.
If everyone thought and acted the same as I... as Satoru does
Hey, wait until I say you can come in.
Sorry, Sis.
You don't look sorry at all.
What is it?
I was just wondering how many more times I'll be able to come in like this.
Wh-What are you saying all of a sudden? It's not like I've gotten the role yet.
This is when it counts.
This is a good luck charm for success in studying, but it'll work for this too, right?
Thanks.
Oh, and it's dinner time.
Tada! For winning( katsu ), we have ton katsu, ton katsu sandwich, katsu don, katsu o, and a big chick win!
And some pas ta for pas sing!
Geez, Mom. You're so superstitious.
And even when Dad gets home, there's no way we can eat all this.
Sorry.
You don't look sorry at all.
This is all I can do for you.
Do your best tomorrow.
Mom...
Hey, Saikou.
Hmm?
For a middle schooler to dream of becoming a manga artist or a voice actress,
and actually make that a reality is a really hard thing to do, don't you think?
Yeah, I guess.
What's this all about?
Well, when you think of it that way, the dream you and Azuki share is impossibly hard to achieve.
Tomorrow, Azuki will stand before that microphone of dreams.
It's really amazing.
The microphone of dreams, huh?
According to that line of thought, we should be happy just to have gotten as far as we have.
A manga artist, a voice actress.
How many people have wanted to become either one, and have given up already?
What's with that?
It sounds like you're trying to tell me not to get depressed if she fails.
That's not it.
I believe she'll get the role.
I'm just reaffirming how amazing it will be to achieve that dream.
It's really amazing.
And like, what comes after is the best.
Are you teasing me or something?
It's Azukyun!
Do your best, Azukyun!
I can't believe you actually showed up, what with all your connections!
You betrayed us!
Go, Azukyun!
Don't mind them.
Right.

Satoru.
Good morning.
I can't believe she showed up.
I wouldn't have.
It's going to be decided by the author, anyway.
Yeah, she's his girlfriend, after all.
What? That's pretty unfair.
Miho!
Are you okay, Namba?
You always catch me at my worst.
But I definitely won't lose to you in today's audition!
Yes. I'm looking forward to it.
Yeah, let's both do our best.
Good morning, Ms. Gouda!
Good morning.
Hello.
Oh, you are Azuki Miho?
Yes.
I am grateful to you for creating such a stage.
All I have to do is read my lines like normal, and I can win the role with all eyes on me!
That's exactly right.
Oh, Nanami.
It's been a while. I'm honored to work with you again.
Same here.
But I never thought you'd try out for the role of Naho.
I was also surprised to be chosen as one of the candidates.
I suppose it means I'm still needed around here.
That's right. You have to keep at it, Ms. Gouda.
Good to see you again, Namba.
And you.
Now everyone, let's play fair and have a good audition, okay?

For actresses
Um, can I ask a question?
Yes?
The broadcast is about to start. Hurry up!
Uh, yes!
Would the first three candidates head to the studio?
The rest of you, please wait until you're called.
Number one, Tanaka Mika.
Thank you for your consideration.
Once again, you're all by yourself in the classroom this late?
So she's not just cute.
What is Weiss?
Thank you.
Editorial Department
Oh, sorry
Huh? Satoru? No idea.
aaa Oh, then he probably went home by him
Satoru... Staying alone in the classroom till late again?
Eh? What is'Weiss'?
Thank you, Tanaka.
It was a refreshing performance.
Yes. I could really tell that she was a pro.
On Air
Oh, Namba is up next.
Number 2, Namba Kana. I'll be playing the role of Minadori Naho.
I hear she's the most popular one among the younger voice actresses.
Thank you for your consideration.
And she's pretty skilled to boot.
Good morning, Satoru!
There's some parts of yesterday's math homework that I don't understand.
She's not the most popular for nothing.
Satoru, you're so nice. Not only do you let me borrow your notes,
Yeah.
but you also explain things until I understand them.
Huh? Satoru? I don't know.
Oh, then he probably went home by himself.
That's Gouda for you. She's excellent.
Satoru, you're all by yourself in the classroom again?
Yes.
What's wrong? You won't go home with your friends anymore.
Or with me.
And lately, you've changed.
You used to be more kind.
This lady is good.
Everyone is really good.
If everyone thought and acted the same as I... as Satoru does,
Will Miho be okay?
Of course she will!
Right?
the world would be a much better place.
Yeah.
Thank you for a passionate performance.
They're all really good. It's so hard to pick just one.
Mashiro...
Do we really have to wait till
our dream comes true?
Will you...
Will you keep waiting for me?
Now, Mashiro is the one waiting for me.
Next, Azuki Miho.
Your turn.
Okay.
Each and every word I'm about to perform
are words leading to my dream.
Number seven, Azuki Miho.
I will be acting the part of Minadori Naho.
Thank you for your consideration.
She doesn't have the script.
Then, please go ahead and begin.
It must be because she intends to move around while she acts.
Good morning, Satoru!
There's some parts of yesterday's math homework that I don't understand.
Satoru, you're so nice. Not only do you let me borrow your notes,
but you also explain things until I understand them.
She's really refreshing!
And this is a voice I've never heard Miho use before.
Yeah!
Your face is getting redder, Satoru.
I'm sorry. Thanks for teaching me this.

Sometimes you say things I don't understand.
What's wrong?
You won't go home with your friends anymore.
Or with me.
And lately...
You've changed.
You used to be more kind.
You just went along with it?
What do you mean?
If everyone thought and acted the same as I... as Satoru does,
then the world would be a better place.
It's not too late.
We can remake it.
Normalcy and common sense are just shackles imposed by the people who run the world.
Thank you.
Th-That was some splendid acting.
Yes.
The mistake in the lines will have an impact on the vote.
Director!
What's wrong, Konaka?
We have a problem.
A problem?
Miho's acting was great!
It was way better than everyone else's!
Yeah!
We're sorry to interrupt the broadcast,
but Director Ehara has something to say.
Go ahead, Director.
I would like to explain something
about Azuki Miho's performance, which we just heard.
In the script where Weiss was originally used, she said the name Schwarz instead.
What? Miho made a mistake?
However, this was our own mistake.
Their mistake?
We made the script based off of the magazine, Weekly Shounen Jack.
But in this section, there was a misprint by the magazine,
and it was corrected from Weiss to Schwarz in the compilation volume.
The editing department just informed us of this.
Indeed, having Weiss there would seem strange for anyone who read the manga closely.
Since Azuki followed the original work in her performance, this will not count as a mistake.
That's such a relief.
Of course, the people who used Weiss will not be penalized.
However, we would prefer it if those who have yet to perform would use Schwarz instead.
The fact that they noticed a mistake in the script isn't the issue here.
What's more important here was Azuki Miho's acting.
We will now resume the audition.
The 20 candidates have all finished.
It's over.
That was tiring.
And now, what you've all been waiting for.
We will now begin accepting votes.
You have one hour from now to enter your votes.
For those watching on TV, press the D button on your remote.
Miho was really good.
But I don't think I did any worse than her.
Azuki Miho... I underestimated her.
Huh? Is that true?
You're too loud!
Azuki Miho's script copy didn't have comments written on it. It looked like it hadn't been read at all.
I'm sure Ashirogi told her what part it was going to be ahead of time.
That's why she knew it was Schwarz instead of Weiss
Do you really think Azuki's performance and attitude was that cheap?
Most probably, if you gave her any page number from the manga,
she could perform Naho's lines from it at the level of performance you saw.
Do you understand?
Yes.
However, a competition is a competition.
I don't intend to lose to anyone.
It's now time!
We received 191,728 total votes!
The announcement at last.
Thank you for all your votes.
A heroine will be born from one of you.
Who has won the role of the heroine?
And now, we will make the announcement.
The winner of the role of Minadori Naho, the heroine of Reversi, is...
This person!
Naka Yoshiko
Ohtsuki Nanami
Azuki Miho
Kitani Mai
She did it!
Azuki Miko
With an overwhelming lead, Azuki Miho lands the role!
She did it!
Now she can get married!
Now then Azuki, please come up to the stage.
I'm so glad! I'm so glad!
Saikou, don't be so quiet!
Celebrate a little!
Saikou!
He's frozen stiff.
Mashiro, are you okay?
I'm okay.
I'm so glad.
Yeah.
I'm so glad.
Everyone.
Congratulations, Azuki.
I hate to say it, but after that performance you gave I hold no grudge for losing against you.
That's...
Without a doubt, you have won the role today based on the strength of your skill.
Please believe that.
Good luck with the Naho role.
Congrats, Miho!
Work hard on our behalf, too.
Thank you.
