Be careful out there, Jintan!
Yadomi?
I'm fine!
Yukiatsu...
That dress...
It looks like the one Menma used to wear.
Wh-Why are you wearing that?
Hey... are you okay?
Do I look okay?
Take a good look at me!
Hey, Yukiatsu!
Please. Let them work this out.
But...
This is the perfect chance. If he doesn't take advantage of it, there may not be another.
Tsuruko...
Hey, I look like Menma, right? I do, right?!
Don't I look like her?
Yukiats
Can't you see her?!
It's my fault.
It's my fault Menma died that day.
What are you talking about? It couldn't possibly be your fault.
If anything, it was my
I'm telling you that it's my fault!
If I hadn't that to Menma, she wouldn't have died.
I made her die!
If Menma were to reappear to anyone, it should be me.
To haunt or to curse me.
Either way, it should be me!
But she never showed herself.
Not to me.
Yukiatsu...
That's how I know she doesn't exist anymore.
She doesn't exist anywhere!
I'm right here.
Menma says she's right here.
You're still saying that...?
She says thank you for the hairpin.
And that she's sorry.
Look, I don't really understand it myself, but...
Yukiatsu...
Are you satisfied?
Hey!
Are you sure we should let him go?
It itches...
Well, I'm done for today.
Did you already know about this?
You could say I caught on.
He'd been asking me to hang out with him after school for a while.
He'd pretend he was buying presents for his inexistent girlfriend.
It was women's clothing. A white one-piece dress with a ribbon.
Should we really have done that?
Yeah. I figure you should squeeze all the pus out of a wound.
But because he's rotten to the core, if you squeeze it all out, then there might not be anything left.
Thank you.
Thanks for the hairpin... And, I'm sorry.
Menma...
Wait up, Jintan!
Jintan!
Wait!
Hold on, Menma!
Why? I can't! Jintan's gonna
Just let him go.
You're not ugly at all, you're...
Here.
I thought it would suit you...
I thought so because I like you!
I'm sorry! Jintan is gonna get away, so...
So I have to go chase him!
We'll talk about this later!
Maybe it doesn't go well with my glasses.
Now I can't see.
Hey, Me
Menma...
Do you want something to eat?
Uh...
I want Ken-chan Ramen!
We don't have any.
And you can't find it anywhere nowadays.
What should I do now?
Let me think...
I'll go buy some.
You don't have to; anything else you have is fine.
Jintan?
Menma died,
but now, she's here.
She came to me, not Yukiatsu.
I didn't care whether she was a ghost or a hallucination,
but I avoided thinking about it.
It's fun when we're all together.
It's fun being with Jintan.
That's why I felt that it's okay not to think about it.
Why is Menma here?
You're way too popular.
They didn't have Ken-chan Ramen. So, instead, I got this.
You got all of this instead?
Yeah.
Just hurry up and sit down...
Jintan, I need to talk to you.
About what? Anyway, the popsicle is going to melt.
I want you to grant my wish.
Why bring that up all of a sudden?
I'm doing the best I can, you know...
In a lot of ways...
Yeah.
And, of course, I haven't been as obsessed as Yukiatsu,
but in my own way...
Yeah.
I have a lot of things going on, too, you know!
I don't have the time to babysit you.
Jintan...
I'm home!
Oh, man, I'm exhausted.
What's all this? Are you having a party?
Is that a popsicle? How cute!
Mind if I have it?
That's not cute.
What's with me?
What did I mean by that?
What do I have going on?
I eat, browse the web,
sleep, play videogames,
sleep, and then eat.
I just repeat that cycle.
And yet...
And yet...
So, I'll take the train on the way home.
I'll be done with work at around 7, so after that...
Gee, it's great that you decided to tag along, Naruko.
Huh?
I was counting on you being there when I made plans,
so I was pretty worried when you told me you wouldn't come.
That's right. Ryou would be pissed at you, otherwise.
Ryou has nothing to do with it.
Hey, actually...
You've been really unsociable lately, you know?
We were even wondering if you still wanted to be friends or not.
Geez, Haruna. Your jokes are too harsh. Don't you think so, Naruko?
Damn. The next one doesn't come for another 30 minutes.
You're the same as always.
In fact, it's creepy how much you haven't changed.
How do you want me to act, then?
Huh?
Do you want me taunt you can call you a femboy?
Yeah. I might prefer that.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't try to use me to restore balance to your self-esteem.
Thanks to you, I managed to put an end to a few things. Thank you.
So then he texts me, saying he loves me!
For real? Sounds like a dream come true.
She got a train and rode it all the way to the city.
And she's lugging around a huge shopping bag.
It's a costume. You'd know all about that.
Huh?
There are certain things you can't manage unless you change your costume.
You were great! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
Stick the next one in, Ryou. Hurry up!
Don't talk like a slutty schoolgirl.
I don't care what it is, just hurry up, Ryou!
What you gonna do schoolgirl?
Having fun?
Calm down, Haruna!
You look like you're forcing yourself to stay.
I'm not forcing myself...
Hey, wanna get out of here?
Sorry, guys. Naruko and I are gonna call it quits.
Wait a sec...
I think she's not feeling well, and I have to get up early tomorrow, too.
I gotta catch One Piece, y'know.
Doesn't One Piece air the day after tomorrow?
Does it?
You guys are no fun!
Tell all about it later, Naruko.
Alright, let's get going.
Oh, right.
U-Um...
Is the train station really this way?
I thought we'd just walk to the station together...
Oh, come on. That's not what get out of here means.
And I'm a bit buzzed, so I wanna rest for a bit.
That's the truth.
I-I'm really not feeling well, so...
Shouldn't you get some rest, too, then?
You're talking about a different kind of rest, though!
Oh, yeah! What about One Piece?
One Piece airs the day after tomorrow.
What? Why don't you just go by yourself?
Wouldn't it be a waste though?
Huh?
They're black aren't they?
Wai Get off of me! I said I don't want to!
Yeah, sure.
No, not, Yeah, sure.
Let me go!
Let me go you bastard!
Huh? Is that you, Anjou?
I'm hanging out with Yadomi right now. You want in?
Who the hell are you?
Hey, guys! I found her!
This is such bullshit.
I just rescued a girl from the arms of a man.
That was the most cliched thing I've ever done.
You call that a rescue?
Wouldn't a rescue involve throwing a punch or two and tearing me away?
I'm hot and I'm smart, but unfortunately I'm a bit lacking in the strength department.
What the heck?
That aside, you're gorgeous.
I don't want to be told that by a tranny.
S-Sorry.
I thought so. Hearing that makes it easier.
Are you a virgin?
Wh-What's wrong with that?
Wanna go out with me?
Don't you like Menma?
Yeah, and?
Because...
Is it Yadomi?
What do you see in that guy?
What do I see in him?
Don't act like you've figured it out! I never said I liked him...
He was a leader, smart, and athletic.
But that was all in the past.
That's true, but he's kind in unexpected ways...
And I think if he fixed his hair, he'd look a bit like Yama from Hey! Say! JUMP.
I see.
I don't even know if I like him.
I just can't stop thinking about him.
Thinking about him?
Menma died, then his mother died.
It became tough to talk to him.
I was actually a bit happy that we'd be going to the same school.
But Yadomi can't forget about Menma.
You can't forget the Yadomi that can't forget about Menma.
Back then...
What?
Back then you said Yadomi's name.
You said you'd been hanging out together.
We're letting an express train pass. Please wait for a moment.
We've been left behind.
There we go.
Ding-dong.
This is delicious!
So why are you eating at my house?
Didn't I bring you some wild plants in exchange?
Tempura was the right choice.
He looks like he's really enjoying it.
You've got dirt above your nose.
Oh, yeah. Is Menma here?
Yes! I'm here!
Menma should eat some tempura too.
Do you seriously believe in her?
Didn't I already say so?
But...
I've thought it over once more.
And?
I'm not sure about this, but Menma being here probably isn't a good thing, right?
It means she couldn't go to heaven.
So that must be why she's here.
Go to heaven?
I don't know. I just don't...
Jintan?
Is Menma over there?
Um... well...
Alrighty.
What? Hey...
Hey Menma, how about giving us a little hint?
I'll grant it quicker than you can ring a bell.
There's something you want right?
You can rely on me a bit, too, you know?
I want to let you go to heaven.
Hey, Hisakawa...
Come on, Menma! Please, tell me.
And let me see you, too.
No good? Come on!
But...
I want to talk with everyone else!
But I just don't know...
How about we all think about it together, Menma?
I don't know about my wish, or about going to heaven.
I just don't know!
Can't we? Let's think about it together.
I don't know...
And then you can...
We still don't know the name of the flower we saw that day.

Upon pages and pages of entries
We've put down all our emotions
But now I've hit a writer's block
I don't know how to finish this page anymore
Putting a bookmark in my diary
You and I go out to ride the bike we found in the dumpster
Let's go to our secret place
Where we piled up our bricks of memories
Run up the hill, where we can see the horizon
Where we can see the sky so fearfully blue
With cider in my right hand
My other hand helps me search for you
You used to come find me way back when
You used to demand me of so much more
You're both still standing right by my side
Yet why do I pray to see you both again?
There must be something off with me

The fireworks blossomed heartrendingly beautiful across the night sky,
and time passed as swiftly as the wind.
We met in an unexpected moment
when you called out to me at the crosswalk,
Let's walk home together.
We shared so many happy times and thrilling adventures
together in our secret base.
I will never forget the hopes and dreams we shared during that one summer's end.
I'm sure we will meet again in another August, in maybe ten years time.
I could feel your heartfelt thanks all the way until the end.
And I know it must've been painful
to hold back your tears and say goodbye with a smile.
But those are my best memories.
Episode 5 Tunnel
Poppo.
Could you let it go?
Please, just let it go.
I don't get it.
I don't get it at all.
