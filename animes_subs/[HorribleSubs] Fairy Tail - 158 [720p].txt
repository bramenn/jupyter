The Grand Magic Games
are about to begin at last.
And Jellal is participating after all!
So we put ourselves at risk to meet Fairy Tail for nothing, right?
Oh, it wasn't for nothing.
At least not for Jellal and Erza...
And now, the Grand Magic Games' opening game! Let's begin Hidden!
The first person to step up is Quatro Cerberus's Yeager!
From Mermaid Heel, Beth Vanderwood!
From Raven Tail, Nalpudding!
Eve has been called out! From Blue Pegasus, Eve Tilm!
All eyes are on Sabertooth, and they go with the minstrel who sings to the red moon!
Rufus is here!
From Lamia Scale, Lyon Vastia!
From Fairy Tail A Team, Gray Fullbuster!
From Fairy Tail B Team, Juvia Lockser!
All of the participating players from the eight teams are set!
And now for the rules of the opening game, Hidden!
On a Night of Falling Stars!
The Grand Magic Games have begun at last!
Let's review the rules together, okay?
There can be up to five participants from each guild.
But according to Poluchka-san,
The Grand Magic Games is a festival that lasts seven days.
If you recover, you should be able to take part.
On my honor as the advising apothecary of Fairy Tail,
I swear I'll cure you!
It looks like you can have reserve members.
I sure hope Wendy, who was ambushed by Raven Tail,
can take part in the tournament.
There are eight teams that made it past the elimination round and can enter the real games.
There are two of our Fairy Tail teams.
I'm so proud!
I don't care about the rest, so I'll cut this short.
Are you sure it's okay to do that?!
Day 1: Hidden and Battle Day 2:??? and Battle Day 3:??? and Battle Day 4:??? and Tag Battle Day 5: Grand Magic Games
The tournament takes place over the span of five days.
This is the program.
Each day has a competition part and a battle part.
In the competition part, the teams can decide which member participates.
Competition Part Points 1st place: 10 points 2nd place: 8 points 3rd place: 6 points 4th place: 4 points 5th place: 3 points 6th place: 2 points 7th place: 1 point 8th place: 0 points
It's a tournament in which each team is ranked.
For the battle part, the sponsors apparently decide the match-ups.
Battle Part Win: 10 points Tie: 5 points Loss: 0 points
The points aren't doled out by rank,
but are awarded with wins.
This system will play out repeatedly over five days
and at the end, the team with the most points will be the winner.
Do your best, Fairy Tail!
Participants for Hidden, come forward.
See ya later.
Good luck!
You better not lose!
Especially to Gajeel's team!
And Sabertooth and Raven Tail and...
If you're a Man, win, Gray!
We're about ready to begin!
But exactly what kind of competition is Hidden?
Commentator Yajima-san, is there a player we should pay attention to especially?
Sabertooth's Rufus-kun is probably the crowd's favorite,
but I'm going to be watching Gray-kun.
How about our guest for today, Blue Pegasus's Jenny-san?!
Of course, our Eve-kun.
He's strong!
Gray-sama...
Sorry to say this, but Juvia has no intentions of losing.
Course not!
Hit me with everything you got!
Sorry, but I'll give you everything I've got as well.
For Juvia's sake!
Don't pay him any attention. His stupidity may be catching.
Actually, I've been wondering since the elimination round,
but what are you?
As you can see, I'm a pumpkin!
Huh? Should I not have asked that?
Juvia thinks you look like a pumpkin, too.
Well, yeah, you look like a pumpkin,
but what's inside...?
This happens every year.
I didn't really pay much attention, though...
I think he's a staff member.
Good job creating a character.
Non, non! I do this for fun, so no need for praise-kabo!
Don't go overboard on the character thing!
Hold on a second here.
This competition that's gonna start any second, Hidden...
I don't know what it entails...
It can't be helped.
It's amazing that two teams from the same guild made it this far...
It's fine with me.
My memory is singing.
It's not necessarily the case that two of them confers an advantage.
I don't especially care either!
I'm fine with it.
I'm impressed.
Is that what they call the confidence of a king?
It's possible your fellow guild member will become your weakness.
She could be held hostage, threatened, leak information...
And many more unfavorable circumstances could be created.
Keep that in mind.
If I don't forget it...
Field open!
What the...?!
A town?!
It's huge!
Whoa...
What the hell is goin' on here?!
A city is appearing in the middle of the arena!
Now I've seen everything...
The creation of a town?
How much magic is being used to pull that off?!
Juvia! Leon!
What happened to everyone else?!
Everyone disappeared...
I see...
So that's the idea...
Hide and seek here?
Where should I hide?
This is a weird way to play hide and seek!
Nobody's the seeker!
Everyone, please enjoy what's going on in town via Lacrima Vision.
The eight participants don't know what the others are doing.
The rules of Hidden are simple.
Each person is both the hider and seeker!
What's that?!
Find each other in this town!
You can use any kind of magic. Then deliver one blow!
It doesn't matter if you do any damage. The person who attacks gets one point.
W-What the hell is this?
What the hell's goin' on here?!
There are tons of the same faces!
That makes you sick?!
After all, a bunch of Grays is gross, isn't it?!
This is a pain.
Even we'll probably lose track of which is the real Gray.
These are copies of everyone.
If you accidentally attack a copy,
you lose one point!
Now, disappear into the silence!
Like a black cat lurking in the dark night!
Let Hidden begin!
This ain't hide and seek,
but more about figurin' out how to find your real enemy!
There are so many Gray-samas!
With all of these around, no one will care if Juvia takes just one!
Gray-sama...
Oh, my! Juvia attacked a copy and lost one point!
In this situation, the player restarts ten seconds later in a different area.
Likewise, if the player is attacked by another wizard, a point is subtracted then too,
and the player restarts in a different area ten seconds later.
That idiot...
This may be a disadvantage to Juvia...
If I knew it'd be like this, I would've done it.
As long as it's within the time limit,
it's possible for the players to restart any number of times.
The time limit is 30 minutes
and the team that has the most points at the end will be in first place.
In this competition, it's harder to find than it is to hide!
Oh, I don't know about that.
You should try to grasp the rules faster.
Who are you?!
Nalpudding from Raven Tail.
I didn't figure you'd be the first one to come at me.
But now I don't have to look for you!
Ice Hammer!
That's different from his Molding Magic up to now, isn't it?
It's the result of all his training.
And now I'm gettin' a point.
What?! That attack should've nailed him head on!
I don't believe it...
Too bad. That was a copy.
The real thing was right behind the copy!
Then he gets a point taken away for attacking a copy?!
Dammit!
I blew it!
I see. So that's how he did it...
He did a good job using his copy to approach the enemy...
A strategy like that isn't bad,
but if the enemy identifies you first, they could possibly do a surprise attack.
This is Hidden!
Everyone is blending in with the crowd.
How is he gonna find'em now?!
I'm glad I'm not out there!
That kind of stuff's outta my league!
If he acts carelessly, the enemy will be alerted to his presence.
What are you going to do, Gray?
Which one's the enemy?
Which one's real?!
Gray-san...
I found you!
Gray!
How did he know?!
That guy...
He went after me again!
You're an easy mark!
This is the first game, Hidden, and the fierce but silent battle continues!
At the moment, Nalpudding is in first place!
On a field with yourself and an army of enemies, what should you do
to ferret out the flesh and blood ones?
There are various ways.
For example, you could look for your opponent's magic.
I think Eve-kun has a better method than that.
Look for your opponent's magic...
Getting a general direction is one thing,
but pinpointing it is tough.
Gray! What the hell are you doin'?!
Don't let the same guy tag you twice!
Raven Tail...
What are you looking at, Blondie?
First, you went after Wendy...
It seems you want to thoroughly crush us, huh?
Blondie...
Enough, Flare.
Damn you, Ivan...
Hang in there, Gray!
Crap. Back to square one...
Carrot Missiles!
Huh? I missed!
What the...?!
I saw you use your magic!
I saw it, too.
Leon...
I found you, Gray.
Gray-sama!
Juvia!
Panties!
Hey, I don't need you to give me a hand.
Juvia knows.
I saw a piece of heaven...
Juvia is going to beat you.
Juvia promised Master!
You promised Gramps?
Yes.
Gimme a break!
Who's gonna be part of that spectacle?!
I don't mind being in it,
but I don't like being on B Team.
Then let's do this.
The team that wins gets to do what they want with the other team for a whole day.
Put another way, it's a punishment game for the losing team.
Do what I want for a whole day...
Buy me some lunch!
Sure, Laxus-san!
Do what I want...
Dance!
Sure!
That sounds like fun, huh?
Salted and grilled mackerel pike, please.
At once.
Do what Juvia wants...
That's...
Since it's the punishment game, I have no choice.
Here, close your eyes.
Okay.
Quit screwin' around!
Hey, Gramps! I didn't hear anything about this!
That local rule applies to us too, doesn't it?!
O-Of course.
Huh. That could be fun.
Do an imitation of Happy!
Aye!
That's... fun?
So Juvia isn't going to lose!
Music to my ears!
I'm gonna get two fairies together!
That guy's after Gray again?!
Bastard...
What the hell's with this guy?!
Oh, my! What on Earthland is this?!
It's started to snow in town!
Eve-kun, huh?
I miscalculated by not realizing there are some wizards here who can stand the cold.
Still, when it's cold, people shiver and their breath turns white.
Copies don't, though.
Exactly.
I see you!
Over there!
That gives Eve three points in a row!
But Leon loses no time pursuing him!
Sorry, but cold doesn't work against me!
Figures...
Found you!
Damn you, Jawface! Just targeting me this whole time...!
Anyway, Sabertooth's Rufus isn't moving at all, is he?
He hasn't attacked anyone or been attacked yet.
This competition is too simple.
W-What is this?!
I remember it...
Everyone's heartbeat, footsteps, the quality of their magic...
What's he doing way up there?!
It's like he's beggin' to be found!
Gray! Look up!
I remember...
I remember it.
Memory Make...
Memory Make...
Molding Magic?!
Huh?
Night of falling stars...
You stick out like a sore thumb!
Oh, no! Just a copy?!
Relax.
You won't lose any points.
That was the memory of me being there.
I don't need a decoy.
E-Everyone else is wiped out!
In an instant, he rocketed to first place!
That is Rufus! That's Sabertooth!
Spectators...
This competition isn't interesting.
After all, I didn't even need to hide.
If they find me, their attacks miss,
because they only target the memory of me that stays behind.
W-Who is this guy?!
He's strong...
I guess he isn't called the strongest wizard in Fiore, bar none for nothing...
That's our Rufus-kun! Even though he's not as strong as Sting-kun...
Yay!
Molding Magic!
I've heard rumors about him...
I see. He really is somebody to be reckoned with.
Think this is all one big joke?! Obey the rules of Hidden!
Again?!
That guy... Instead of going for the opponent who's right in front of him...
Time's up!
Here are the rankings!
What are you doing?!
Obaba, calm down!
Not too bad, I guess you could say.
Yeah...
Ugh. This isn't good.
Beth did her best!
As expected, Sabertooth took first place.
It was brilliant!
Both Fairy Tail teams put up a good fight,
but their results were unfortunate.
I expect better from them next time.
I knew Fairy Tail was gonna suck!
Always in last place!
Your day is over!
What's so funny, asshole?!
He blew his stack!
Howl all you want!
Enough.
If they wanna laugh, let'em.
Sorry.
It's fine! We're just getting started...
Raven Tail...
Molding Magic wizard...
I swear I'll get you both back!
And now we continue to the battle part.
A member from each team will fight in a single match.
This isn't a tournament.
And the sponsors decide the pairings, right?
I just hope the match-ups are interesting.
I've just received the list of matches!
The first match of day one!
From Fairy Tail A, Lucy Heartfilia!
Me?!
Versus Flare Corona from Raven Tail!
Blondie...
Lucy, do your best!
That Flare woman, her opponent, is a little creepy, you know?
Is she muttering to herself? What's she saying?
Blondie...
Like I said, Blondie...
Wandy?
No! Blondie...!
B-Blonde... ee... Blonde undies?
Where'd you get that from?!
Next time: Lucy Versus Flare!
She might actually be saying blonde undies.
Blonde undies...
Nah, that's not it.
