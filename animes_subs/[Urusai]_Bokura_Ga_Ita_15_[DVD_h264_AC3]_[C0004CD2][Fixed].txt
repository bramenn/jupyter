Hey, the float's coming along pretty nicely.
How's the cafe going?
Right on schedule. Wanna see?
Ah, umm... has Yano been showing up?
Huh? Yeah, he's been there. Why?
Ah, well... I was a little worried he might be slacking off or something.
After all, that's all he did last year.
After what happened, he completely stopped coming to see me...
I see... he's been showing up...
Hey, gimme a break!
You're so clumsy!
Thank goodness... he's the same as always...
So full of life...
Even though we broke up...
Even though I broke up with him, why is it that I still don't want to hurt him?
Usotsuki na anata nakimushi no atashi
Doushite umaku ikanai wa
Oshare shita kami mo rain suton no tsume mo
Anata wa kidzuki mo shinai ne
Love kanashii namida nanka ja nai yo
Me ga kawaite hirihiri suru dake
Kono unmei bakari I love
Kimi dake wo atashi dake wo
Atsui omoi wo uketomete
Doko made mo tsunagattetai
Kawaikunai nakigao mo se mo aishiteru
Why can't things go well between
the liar, you, and the crybaby, me?
You don't notice my styled hair
or my nice set of press-on nails.
Love isn't about the unhappy tears that go along with it.
Those tears only leave my eyes dry and hurt me.
I love this destiny
between only you and only me.
I want to accept your hot feelings
and be taken by you forever.
Despite your uncute, tearful face and your shortness, I still love you.
Episode 15 ...
Nana! Over here, over here!
You didn't come in a yukata this year.
Neither did you.
Well, it's just us girls tonight.
But Nana, didn't a certain someone invite you to come?
Like Yano?
N-No... actually, I was wondering how to decline the invitation if he had asked me...
But he didn't.
Seriously?!
How about Takeuchi-kun?
There's no way he would, Mizu-chin. Don't make me repeat myself.
I had decided to decline anyway...
All right! Since it's just us girls, let's make something of this!
Yeah!
What's up with that? That's awesome!
Y-Yano-senpai...
U-Umm...
Would you please do a round of goldfish scooping for me?
I heard you were really good at it...
It'd be cheaper to just buy one at a goldfish store.
P-Please...
Who's that? One of the underclassmen?
She said senpai really loud.
Is she a first year?
I'm so much better with the wafer plates than these pois...
Oh, well.
Wow!
He got me one! Yano-san got me one!
No way! Are you serious? Lemme see!
Even if it's cheaper at a goldfish store, it wouldn't mean anything!
Look! It's a big pop-eyed goldfish!
He's so nice!
So Yano's here, too...
Looks that way.
I see... Yano's also here...
I'm going to treat it well for the rest of my life!
Yeah!
He's here...
Hey! We should be having a blast, too!
Let's beat them with some turtle scooping!
T-Turtle?
He's here with other people...
Hey, twilight in the summer really makes you want to see the one you love, don't you think?
Twilight in the summer?
Or on rainy days, or during the season when cherry blossoms fall, or in those long nights...
Being single is so lonely!
That's all year round for you...
Whoa! It's alive?!
Shoot, I messed up.
It's harder than it looks, huh?
Hey mister, one try please.
Being single... is so lonely...
Oh... he's pretty good at this.
Hey, what do you wanna do next?
I'll give you one.
Since you're such a cutie.
Nice! Go on and take it.
Go on and take it, miss.
I-Is it really all right...?
Excuse me.
She's my girlfriend, so would you please not do that?
Let's go!
That guy was a decoy.
He was working with the guy in the stall.
He would give you the turtle for free, then try to sell you expensive food for it.
It's hard to decline something you're getting for free, right?
I see...
Why is Takeuchi-kun looking at me so gently?
You sure know a lot about this stuff.
Ah... a friend of mine was asked to do it part-time a long time ago.
Ah, and I'm sorry about calling you my girlfriend!
I-It's fine. Thanks.
It's just such a pain once you get mixed up with them.
Yeah.
Y-You got separated from your friends because of me...
Ah, don't worry. I just got a text message from them.

Good going, Nanami ('')
Nice, Nanami. Go for it! Make things go well with Takeuchi. ('')
Well, I'll be going then. Will you be all right?
Y-Yeah.
I made plans with people from around my area again, like last year.
Nothing but guys, though. Not really appealing at all.
Yeah.
See you.
I'm such a moron...
What was I hoping for?
Being single... is lonely.
Takahashi.
If you ever think you're getting into a dangerous situation, call me right away.
I'll be there in a flash.
What? Takeuchi-kun left?
Of course he did.
Of course?
Nana, you're blushing...
This is the same girl who said it wasn't possible because Takeuchi-kun was Yano's best friend.
If Takeuchi-kun found out he was being refused for that reason, he wouldn't be able to do anything either, I'm sure.
Of course, this is just considering the off-chance that he does actually like you.
The off-chance...
What?
Sign: Octopus Balls
I thought you would've invited her.
Well, she did say it's not possible.
What about you? You didn't invite her?
Oh, right. She said you bothered her, didn't she?
Die.
I wonder if she's here in her yukata again...
I haven't seen her.
She might've come in a yukata...
Knowing her, she might've come alone with her girlfriends, and been an east mark for some stall keeper.
An easy mark?
I wouldn't worry about that. They don't make marks of really cute girls.
You're really... a nice guy.
When?
Unlike you...
I don't say things like no matter what happens, we'll always be friends.
What's that suppose to be? A threat?
Just the truth.
If only I were a good guy like you.
Hey... before, you told Takahashi you'd be waiting for her, but...
When you still haven't organized anything there's no way it'll go well.
Right now, it's impossible for you.
Impossible?
You're in love with Nana-san, aren't you?
She's dead.
She's still alive within you.
Which is why you have no right to go out with Takahashi.
I'm going to make my move.
Coffee
Orange Juice
Hot Chocolate
Tea
What've you been doing? You look so strained.
About this... no matter how many times I calculate it, there's hardly any profit.
Yano, it doesn't matter if we make a profit, as long as we break even.
After all, this is for the school festival.
Anyway, we'll scare away customers if the prices are too high, right?
Then, what? We're all gonna work for nothing?
We're gonna get nothing out of all the blood and sweat we've put into it?
AWKWARD SILENCE
It's begun again...
Their one-on-one battle...
Let's at least make enough to take care of the fees for putting this up.
It's too stupid and pointless like this.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Let's leave the drink menu alone, and raise the prices on the side order menu slightly.
Menu
Coffee
Orange Juice
Hot Chocolate
Black Tea
Oolong Tea
Green Tea
But in exchange, let's add some sort of special deal.
Oh, that sounds good.
If we manage to sell a lot, we'll be able to eat and drink for free afterwards.
This should definitely make everyone a little more excited about selling.
Hey...
Can I ask you something?
How is one able... to forget about the dead?
How do you...
Please...
It's...
Something wrong?
Ah, nope... I just came to grab some duct tape.
Those two are getting along unusually well this year.
Last year, you could feel the cold vibes coming off them.
Y-Yeah. I wonder what happened this year...
Sign: The 43rd High School Festival
Please come to Class 2-7's Asian Cafe!
We have refreshing drinks and sweets!
We also offer special discounts for couples!
It's really hot out today.
And we have less flyers than we thought we'd need...
I'll have to go copy some more.
Nana! Have a drink!
You must be thirsty, right?
Ah, it's so cold and good!
Yeah, it's great. What is it?
What's this leaf?
Mizu-chin, you really know what hits the spot!
It's from Yano.
He told me to tell you it must be hard handing out all those flyers, since it's so hot out.
Oh. Long time no see.
Asian Cafe
Order incoming!
Two iced teas!
Here we are.
Shock
Surprise
Argh
W-Why are those two together?!
What's up with that costume?
An iced tea and... um...
The master's recommended special shake. Got it.
So that's what it's called on the menu.
Ah, um... it was really good. What's in it?
A piece of banana, milk, ice, and syrup.
It's a complete ripoff!
Order incoming.
Where you off today?
Hurry up and leave already
I'm working the late shift today.
What? You also graduated from here, Ayaka-san? I had no idea!
Don't go putting strange things in her head
I'll never trust you again
Be the way, do they still have that whole confession time during the closing festival?
I just can't seem to relax in here.
Moto, make the drinks to go, would you?
Right away.
I see... so they still have it.
That brings back memories.
There was this one time where I was confessed to and ran right into the relationship.
But we broke up right away.
I have some good memories because of it, though.
That reminds me. Do you have a new boyfriend yet?
I heard you broke up, so I thought there might be someone else you like.
Ah, no, that's not exactly it...
I haven't really sorted out my feelings on the issue yet...
That's why, for now...
You're sorting them out.
Hey. Do you know how to forget about an old love?
You find a new love.
You should completely immerse yourself in it.
If that new love is true, then the old love will naturally become part of the past.
It's not that you can fall in love with someone new because you forgot the old...
It's because you fall in love with someone new that you're able to forget about the old.
Only love can heal a heart that was hurt by love.
Are you...
Who knows?
Think about it and make your decision.
Whatever you do or don't do, you're the one who always makes the decision.
You're the one who always makes the decision...
Now, let's see how this all comes to rest.
Oh... we made enough to pay everyone...
I can't believe it, but that ripoff menu produced results...
Yamamoto-san, you're amazing!
It's all thanks to Yano.
Aren't we going to leave yet?
Just wait another ten minutes!
They said they're running late because of the traffic.
Hey! Line up, line up!
She's still alive within you.
It's impossible.
I can't make you happy.
It's impossible for you.
Hey, is it really all right for you to go out with me?
I'm famous for being the stupid girl.
Your reputation will take a hit.
That's so dumb.
People who call other people stupid are stupid.
So... you think you're stupid.
Yeah. I know I am.
You don't know anything.
People are truly stupid when they can't even realize their own stupidity.
So don't ever call yourself stupid.
Ow! I fell over!
You're so stupid!
People who call other people stupid are stupid!
You turn them into memories.
The past holds as little reality as your dreams.
Hurry and realize that already.
And turn her into memories.
Let go.
You'll be fine, Yano...
There's a ton of people here again this year!
Everyone, let them hear you shout!
Hey, you're going too fast!
Give some space to the people in front of you!
You're gonna wear yourselves out!
Hey, if it all goes well, I'll treat you to something.
What are you talking about?
You're going to confess, right?
Honestly, I'm not sure...
He's been my best friend since elementary school.
He's more important to me than my family is.
No one can replace him.
So you'll choose friendship over love?
I don't want to lose either.
I wonder if I'm being selfish...
But...
Which is why you'd better treat me to something if I lose my best friend tonight.
This year really went by quickly...
You think so?
Ah, come to think of it, Yano confessed to you on this day last year, didn't he?
Now that I think about it, it didn't even last a year.
Is it time to rotate yet?
Not yet. Wait until the next intersection.
Yano!
Who's that?
My old friends from middle school. They must've been bored tonight.
Stop! Stop!
Wait for the traffic light!
Something interesting's bound to happen this year...
Who will end up crying, and who will be left laughing?
If that new love is true...
Wait for the traffic light!
Right now...
Please.

Endless rain keeps falling.
The cool, chilly rain.
It continues to fall, refusing to let up,
almost as if it's sustaining my feelings.
I've always found your gentle back
on that day, but where do
my winding feelings point?
I wonder what you see
before you?
We keep running
and it seems like we'll make it, but we don't.
Just like that.
The rain continues to fall softly.
A slightly lonely rain
will pour all around.
It's as if it's meant to soothe my heart,
I'm always looking at your
cute back, but these winding feelings
point me in the other direction.
What's waiting for me
at the end of my search?
We keep on running
and it seems like we'll make it, but we don't.
Just like that.
We keep on running
and it seems like we'll make it, but we don't.
Just like that.
Just like that.
Just like that.
Just like that.
Episode 16 Preview...
I'm glad you were my friend.
You better make sure you don't forget those words.
That's dirty!
You're too naive.
Yano's headed your way right now.
And one more thing...
If my intuition's correct, Takeuchi-kun's coming, too.
No way...
Both of them are coming...
What'll I do...?
I'm still undecided about my feelings...
