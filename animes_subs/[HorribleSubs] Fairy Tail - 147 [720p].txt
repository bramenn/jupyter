Bastard...
Son of a bitch, this ain't funny.
You?!
How dare you fool me, Rapowant?!
Byro...
Natsu! Thank goodness you're safe!
Naturally!
You think I'd be done in by the likes of these chumps?!
Wendy, treat the cardinal.
Right!
This person is a cardinal?
Unbelievable...
You even dare break into this holy sanctuary? I've never seen a more insolent guild...
Byro...
Bastard...
No matter how desperately you maggots struggle, you won't be able to stop Real Nightmare.
This world is going to end.
The great power behind the establishment of Zentopia,
its source is the Infinity Clock...
Long ago, it was called the Infinity Castle.
Infinity Castle?
During the upcoming anniversary event that's held once every 100 years,
the Infinity Castle will release all of the magic it's accumulated.
100 years' worth of magic.
There is no way to fight against it.
Why are you doing this?!
To return this world to chaos.
There's no other reason than that.
If I control Real Nightmare,
I can return the world to the state of chaos it was in prior to the founding of Zentopia.
The time has come for people to unleash the malice and desires they've kept sealed deep inside.
That's what Neville feared,
which is why he created a seal that would last throughout the ages, right?
But what does that have to do with Lucy-san?
To the Infinity Castle!
Girl who holds most of the 12 Gold Keys,
who opens the gates to other worlds, you possess a high level of magic.
This clock that was sealed away by Celestial Spirit Wizards
can only be controlled by the magic of a Celestial Spirit Wizard.
Who do you expect to do that?!
Relax. You're just a sacrifice.
The clock is in our possession.
Through your magic, the Infinity Castle will be in tune with our intentions.
With Real Nightmare, individual values are controlled,
and as a result, discord will disappear from the world.
I'm proud.
Nee-san, you're going to give people true freedom.
If you wish to stop the Infinity Clock,
you'll have to put an end to that girl's life.
There's no other way.
The end of the world will start here, from Zentopia!
What's happening?!
My body...!
I pity you, Rapowant.
I get it.
You're also one of the fakes.
You didn't realize that you were just a puppet, created by Personification Magic.
I'm the one who used that!
What nonsense are you talking...?!
We've seen a lot of puppets on our way here.
They had the same form as you.
That's how we know.
You were merely a tool.
Wrong!
I'm a Zentopia cardinal!
I'm not... a doll...
I'm... I'm...
That smell...
Master Zero's hair...
Pathetic thing...
I guess it was made to think it was human.
Not just Rapowant...
My Legion was also nothing more than tools.
But at last, I've realized the path I should take.
As Zentopia's soldiers, we should save the world.
In order to stop the Infinity Clock,
I will dispose of Lucy.
Over my dead body!
Bastard...
I have a score to even with this guy.
The rest of you save Lucy.
Right now, I wanna pay this guy back 100 times over,
but I'll let you take him, Gildarts.
I know how to get to the Infinity Castle!
Alright! Lead on!
Coco... I'm glad you're safe.
You!
Sammy!
I shall carry out Byro-sama's will.
What are you talkin' about?!
What are you trying to do?!
Nii-san, this is my decision.
Already, there's no time to lose!
Wait! Sammy!
I feel bad for all of you,
but I don't need to calculate to know this.
When one life is in the balance against the end of the world,
the answer is obvious.
Happy!
Aye, sir!
I won't let you interfere!
Damn you!
Happy!
I told you that I'm your opponent!
Natsu! Please save Lucy!
Leave it to me!
This way!
Warren, you stay here as our communications liaison.
Gray, Gajeel, Elfman, come with me!
Alright!
Halt!
Don't you take your eyes off of me!
Have you forgotten?
I have the power to nullify all magic.
If I can't use magic,
then I guess I'll just have to rely on this, huh?
In a physical showdown,
I, who practice swordplay and barehanded fighting every day, will surely win.
You're big on logic.
In fact...
It appears that Rapowant is no longer with us.
His role was already done.
Although he was a puppet made from my father's hair,
in the end, he was disposable.
What's that?!
I don't care if you create it from magic or what, but a life is a life!
Incorrect.
What's important is the heart.
That's what that thing was lacking in.
Heart...
Is it the same magic that was cast on Cana?
Likely.
What do you think, Wendy?
My Healing Magic has no effect.
Oh, no...
His fever hasn't gone down either.
Why?
There are traces of magic on the archbishop's brain, showing he was under a spell for a long time.
It's clinging to him like a disease.
Unless it can be removed, the archbishop won't recover.
What should we do?
If I can perform delicate Healing Magic upon him without damaging his brain...
If the archbishop returns to his senses,
we may be able to learn something about the Infinity Clock.
Do you best, Wendy.
I will.
Something's coming closer.
Is it Natsu?!
No... This is...
I found you! My calculations were right.
That's... Samuel?!
Lucy-nee-san belongs to me.
I won't let anyone else have her!
Isn't Samuel on your side, Michelle?!
That may have been the case once.
But I know why he's here.
He intends to kill you, Nee-san.
I made an error...
It's ironic.
We used Legion and now you're after her life, while we're protecting her.
Even if I can't fly...
I can use my own legs to climb.
Byro-sama... I...
You could hear their telepathic communications, too, couldn't you?
What do you intend to do now?
Now...?
Even Byro-sama... Even His Grace, the archbishop himself, was just used as a tool.
Which means...
Then it wasn't Zentopia's doctrine. I was just being used by the new Oracion Seis.
That's right, isn't it?
I feel like such a loser...
Gatman-chama... Gatman-chama...
Goodnight.
What the hell is that?
The rest is up to you... Coco...
Hurry, everyone!
That girl is fast!
According to Fabrizio-san,
we can get up to the Infinity Castle
through the eye at the triangle of the cathedral's center!
Hang on, Lucy!
I'm Lahar, the Captain of the Enforcement and Detention Corps of the Magic Council.
As long as you're inside this barrier that the Rune Knights made,
you won't be influenced by the magic coming from those chains.
Stay quiet in here!
Direct Line!
Mama!
Stay calm!
I'm going to take you inside this barrier!
Go ahead, quickly! Inside the barrier!
Look.
His complexion is improving little by little.
Carefully...
Delicately...
It looks tough...
This is the first time she's tried to cure someone continuously
over the course of several hours.
Gildarts Clive!
Why aren't you giving me everything you've got?
I didn't want the brats to see it...
Me pulverizing you...
You jest with me...
That was a good warming up.
This might be good once in a while, pitting muscles against muscles.
Wendy, if you go overboard, it'll put you in danger, too.
Shouldn't you take a little break?
I'm fine. It's finished.
Already?!
Wow! When did you improve this much?
I've just gained experience, that's all.
At any rate, the archbishop has been freed from that magic.
It's true! His fever's down, too!
Those are some impressive skills.
We sure can rely on you!
She removed the magic, which saved the archbishop's life...
She removed it...
I see!
What's wrong?!
Samuel is going to try stopping the clock by eliminating Lucy,
but there's another way to stop it.
What is it?
We beat all the members of the new Oracion Seis!
The members of the new Oracion Seis?
Beat all of them?!
What would that do?
When the Infinity Clock was reactivated, the new Oracion Seis engraved their seals on it, remember?
When I think back, I remember Michelle engraving the sixth seal...
Those seals must serve as proof of ownership of the Infinity Clock.
So if we defeat all the members of the new Oracion Seis,
we can remove their right of ownership to the Infinity Clock, right?
And then maybe we'll be able to free Lucy, too!
Aye, sir!
Alright! I'll pass that on to Natsu and the others right away!
I'm gonna set off to find Lucy, too!
Me too!
I'll stay here with Wendy, but be careful, you two!
Hey! Did everyone catch that?!
The Infinity Clock...
I can't hear so good!
There was lots of static, but it's a telepathic message from Warren!
What?!
If we beat all the members of the new Oracion Seis...
And we might be able to save Lucy that way, too?!
I like how easy it is to understand.
All we have to do is kick all their asses, right?!
A simple strategy that stirs up the blood!
Now that's a Man!
I'm all fired up!
Don't make me laugh.
You're...
Cobra?!
I can hear it...
Your anxiety, desperation, despair...
I'm gonna take him!
You're the last one.
Before that, there's someone else...
You heard him, right? I think he likes me.
But...
I heard them...
The screams from his heart...
Silence!
Natsu! Let's go!
Yeah...
Erza! If you lose, I'm gonna wallop you!
What are you laughing about?
It's not even worth answering.
You can hear it, can't you?
What is this place?!
A greenhouse?!
Why would somethin' like that be inside a clock?!
How the hell should I know?!
That's as far as you go, cretins.
That's...
I'll take her!
What the hell?! Everybody's decidin' on their own!
It doesn't matter, just go!
Alright, whatever.
She kind of annoys me, anyway...
Boring...
I have to fight you again?
Don't worry!
I'll make it interesting for you soon enough!
I discovered an intruder!
Midnight!
I mean... Brain II, right?!
We're not letting you people get any higher than this.
Alright! I'll take this guy on!
Don't get cocky, Salamander!
This one's mine!
You too, Gajeel?! You're the one that's cocky!
Since you call yourself Brain II,
that means you're the leader of the new Oracion Seis, right?
And you're a Fairy Tail underling, I take it?
You better find that out for yourself.
Get outta here, Salamander!
I told you, don't decide by yourself!
Leaving this one in Gajeel's hands and pressing on is a Man!
Let's hurry!
I'll remember this, asshole!
That attack...
Spicy!
Sugar Boy...
You still intend to fight us?
Byro-sama ordered me to keep Fairy Tail away from the Infinity Clock, see...
Circumstances have changed.
Right now, Byro and the new Oracion Seis are enemies.
That's just crazy!
Is it true, Snake Boy?
Get lost.
What?
Be destroyed by your own voice.
Wha...?! I'm losing control of my hound dogs! No!!
Get out of my sight!
Unbelievable!
I was so excited about fighting Ice Boy again!
But before that, fade out! Spicy! Bye-bye, Armor Girl and Snake Boy!
Now then, let's continue, Titania.
Lance of the Iron Dragon!
I see. So you're a Dragon Slayer, too...
Is that Reflector or whatever it's called? That kinda magic is annoying.
You're the one they call Iron Gajeel, right?
It seems like your brain's made out of iron, too!
Shut up!
Lance of the Iron Dragon... Demon Logs!
I get more powerful when I eat!
Roar of the Iron Dragon!
You've made me want to see your face... when you're in agony.
No matter how twisted up my face gets, as long as I don't run away, who gives a shit?!
Sword of the Iron Dragon!
What did you in was the rarely-seen...
Come at me with more power!
Is that all there is?
Give me everything you got!
It's too wide...
The gap between our strength...
You got beyond the frustration of being betrayed
and fought for what you believe in.
But the thing is,
to our guild, there's nothin' more important than the lives of our friends.
Even if the fate of the world is in the balance...
I wanted to fight with you longer,
but I'm out of time.
Goddammit! I was just gettin' started!
What the...?!
Gajeel!
Seriously?!
The hub of the magic power that flows through the Infinity Castle...
We should be close to it, but...
I don't smell Lucy's scent. Why not?!
Maybe it's because she's linked up to the Infinity Clock!
I'm picking up Michelle's scent!
If we follow that, it could lead us to Lucy!
Alright!
Lucy!
Natsu...
Elfman...
Coco...
Nee-san's never going back to you people.
All Nee-san needs is me!
Michelle!
I won't let anyone have Nee-san!
Come to think of it, I guess an angel appeared this time.
An angel? Aren't angels creatures from fantasy stories?
I don't really know,
but I saw with my own eyes, so what do you want me to say?
Oh, maybe you're talking about me.
How the hell could you take what I said to mean that?
When you say Fairy Tail and angel together, you must be referring to me, right?
Next time: An Angel's Tears!
Since when has anyone identified you as an angel?
Maybe since the day I was born...
I'm surprised you can say that with a straight face.
