On the night of Christmas Eve,
I made up with Shiina,
and passed the Let's Make a Game proposal screening.
If things had gone well between Jin-san and Misaki-senpai,
it would have been the perfect Christmas Eve.
But...
So, how did it turn out like this?
Idiot.
Hey, Shiina, you remember what I said, right?
Chihiro-sensei's going on vacation to Australia over winter break,
so we can't stay in Sakura Hall.
I know.
Then, why haven't you asked Rita to come get you?
You realize we're all going home, don't you?
Aoyama-san, don't tell me you...
I-It's not like that!
My head's been full of other thoughts,
and I completely forgot about going home.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Forgetting that is a huge problem!
I can't go home anyway, so I'm sorry...
S-So, what about you, Misaki-senpai?
I don't want to go home.
My hometown's full of memories of me and Jin.
I don't want to go home.
Senpai...
In that case, you'll all have to go stay at Kanda's place.
What?
S-Sensei, what are you saying?!
I'm leaving this afternoon.
Make sure you're packed and ready to leave by then.
Sorata, strike while the iron's hot.
What?!
It's already been decided?
Komachi, this is a bullet train.
It's fast, isn't it? Whoosh!
I'm glad we found people to take care of the other six.
Yeah, only Komachi was left behind.
Look, it goes 285 kilometers per hour! Zoom!
Do you regret it?
Worrying about the past doesn't do any good.
I want to focus on the future.
That's some backwards optimism.
You can have this.
I prefer bamboo shoots...
I gave my last bamboo shoot to Nanami.
Sorry, I already ate it.
You rushed to eat that, didn't you?
Misaki-senpai, do you want some mushrooms?
I like bamboo shoots.
Okay, that's enough!
I'll eat all the mushrooms, okay?
We will shortly be arriving in Hakata.
Thank you for using the bullet train today.
What?! Wh-Wh-What are all these people doing here?!
Uh, th-thanks for letting us stay with you...
I can't do it! I can't stay at a boy's house!
You're saying that after coming this far?!
And there're even more sweet and fragile girls now!
Nice to meet you. I'm Kamiigusa Misaki.
Huh? Um, nice to meet you.
She's right...
You must be the friends Sorata mentioned on the phone.
You're all such cute girls.
Huh? What?!
I'm the only one who didn't know?
I thought it might be more fun that way.
Successful Surprise!!
Mom's teasing me!
Sorata, you're back.
Y-Yeah...
I'm home.
I don't recall allowing you to be polygamous.
Not even the country's laws allow that!
Come on, everyone.
Dinner's ready. Come on in.
E-Excuse us...
This'll be a fun end to the year.
I think I understand how you adapted to life in Sakura Hall.
I'm starting to feel the same way.
I wonder if Jin's had his dinner...
Did you suddenly get an urge to hear my voice?
That's exactly it.
That's nice of you to say.
Do you understand my situation?
I'm currently in Fukuoka with everyone...
Chihiro-chan told me.
I respect you. So, what do you want?
What happened between you...
and Misaki-senpai on the night of Christmas Eve?
I told Misaki I love her.
I confessed my love to Misaki.
Wh-What are you talking about?
If that's the case, why is Misaki-senpai...
I asked for more time because I love her.
Time?
College Entrance Examination Series
Osaka Art Schools
I'm going to college in Osaka to chase my dreams.
Just because I love Misaki...
No, exactly because I'm in love with Misaki,
I can't become a worthless man who's abandoned his goals.
I want to move forward for once, too.
Let's Make a Game Rhythm Battler Vol. 1 Rhythm Action Battle Game Entry No. 06848860 Kanda Sorata
Well, there you have it.
Take care of Misaki for me for a while.
She'll get jealous if I talk to you for too long, so I'm hanging up.
Are you at one of your girlfriends' homes?
I broke up with them all.
I'm staying with my friend, the Student Council President.
Who are you calling your friend?!
See you later.
What?!
Mitaka, you...
Hey, Student Council President...
That's former Student Council President.
Do you think I'm wrong?
Yeah, you're wrong.
I see.
But you're also equally right.
I see.
Starting tomorrow, I'll make dinner every night.
Every night?!
What do you want to eat?
Just get out of my house!
I'm stuffed!
Motsunabe, chanpon, mentaiko...
That's a real Hakata dinner right there.
Thank you, Nanami-chan.
It's like Sorata found himself a bride.
What?!
Y-You think I could be Kanda-kun's bride?
What are you doing, Onii-chan? Hey!
Sorata, do you want a wife?
You'll have to defeat me before you can marry my brother!
Get off me.
Sorata, you're too close.
I can't defeat Yuko like that.
Don't accept her challenge!
She's serious?!
In that case, I have to get into Suimei...
and face Mashiro-san in an all-out battle!
I will have to use my Plan C on Yuko.
No annihilating!
But, Yuko, your father is opposed to you taking the Suimei entrance exam.
I know! That's why I need Onii-chan to convince
No.
Instant rejection?!
Convince him yourself.
I'm busy during the break preparing for my presentation.
Presentation? What's that? Does it taste good?
Delicious!
I'll never let you take the Suimei entrance exam.
I absolutely will not allow it!
That's final.
Oh dear.
Hey, Yuko-chan.
Do you want to start studying together tomorrow?
Huh?
If your father sees you studying hard, he might change his mind.
Aoyama...
What am I going to do, Onii-chan?!
Nanami-san's such a good person!
She's totally the one I need to keep my eye on!
What are you talking about?
Jin! Did you finish writing the script?
Yeah, here.
Yeah! Thanks, Jin!
Okay, I'll start working on some layouts!
Sure.
Misaki?
In other words, I shouldn't just focus on giving the presentation,
but also put myself in the shoes of the listener...
Presentation Techniques Lecture
Grab the attention of your listener!
That's right.
I believe it's important to include information...
the screening committee will find interesting.
I see. Maid-chan, thanks.
If you're truly grateful, why don't you take a quick trip to England...
and take care of someone for me?
Sorry. I don't do those kinds of jobs.
I look forward to hearing the results.
You mean the results of the presentation, right?!
Genre: Rhythm Action Game
Something interesting, huh?
Now I just have to figure out what that is...
Game Pitch Contents Fun Target Concept Benefits
Something the listener will find interesting? How to play System Controls Appeal of the product?
I've written all the necessary points in my pitch document.
What else would the screening committee want to hear about?
Onii-chan, help me study!
Huh? Where's Aoyama?
She went shopping with Mom.
So, while she's gone, teach me.
That's a lot of books...
This magazine...
I was thinking about reading it over my break.
You came here planning to take a break?
This is my oasis.
A manga I like is serialized in here.
It's written by someone called Shiina Mashiro-sensei.
The art's really beautiful.
Oh, but there are some weird characters.
These two.
Those are based on Jin-san and Misaki-senpai...
Their expressions of emotion leave something to be desired.
They won't get together, but they won't break up either.
Who knows what they really want? No, no!
Honestly, I don't understand it.
Don't understand...
Now that I think of it, Mashiro-san, you've got the same name.
You're her?!
Yeah.
That's amazing!
I'm a huge fan! Can I have your autograph?
That was a major change of heart.
Yuko-chan, there you are!
Sorry for making you wait. Let's work hard together!
Mashiro-sensei, I'm cheering for you.
I look forward to next month's volume.
By the way, are you going to meet your deadline?
You won't be able to use a computer over the break...
I already did it.
What?
I gave it to Ayano.
I injured my finger.
I did it after it healed.
I see.
Is that right?
Huh?
Is that what you like about me?
Wha
Since then, I've liked that about you.
Answer me.
Y-Yeah, that's right.
Good.
What? Is this for my presentation?
Use your abilities by hitting the buttons in time with the rhythm!
Use combos to score lots of points!
Will you stop liking me if I draw things that aren't manga?
I-I won't!
Good.
I've got to work hard.
No, really...
Thanks.
This concludes my pitch.
Thank you very much.
That was amazing, Onii-chan!
You've become a truly competent man!
Yeah, it's gotten a lot easier to understand.
Sorata, you've grown so much.
That was so cool! I want to hear it again!
Aoyama, did you make these? I thought Mom did.
She used to make them for me all the time.
Y-Yeah, she taught me. Are they good?
Yeah.
They're great, thanks.
I-I see.
That's good.
You're so focused on your work, you don't even eat dinner.
It's already New Year's Eve.
The presentation's right after the break,
but it took a while for it to take shape.
It was really good.
But I still feel a little uneasy.
Aoyama, if you were on the screening committee,
what would you want to hear during a presentation?
Who, me?
I don't know much about games, but...
Let's see...
If I worked for a company,
I might wonder if a game would make money or not.
Sorry. That might be obvious.
No, I was so caught up in whether it'd be fun or not,
I had completely forgotten about that!
That's amazing! Thanks, Aoyama!
You're always helping me out, Aoyama.
You made me rice balls for my first presentation, remember?
Thanks for everything.
And you've got an audition coming up.
Sorry for being a burden.
No, it's okay.
I'm doing this because I want to.
Besides, doing other things takes my mind off of it.
The only thing I can do until the script arrives is prepare myself mentally...
Aoyama...
Oh, yeah...
Once my script gets here, I'll get you to help me practice for my audition.
Here.
You don't have to do that.
I'd help you in any way I can.
What? Why?
W-Well, because I want you to pass your audition.
I've been watching you work hard since we were first years.
But the truth is, I might just actually want you to prove...
hard work is always rewarded.
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
No, it's fine.
Let's both work hard.
Yeah.
I'll work hard, too.
I want to work hard with you.
Shiina, you always work hard.
I-I think so, too...
There have been lots of things I don't understand lately.
It's nothing.
Shiina?
There are lots of things I don't understand.
Mashiron?
Misaki, how do you want things to go with Jin?
Who knows what you want? No, no.
Huh? What does that mean?
In my manga, you're together.
Is that wrong?
What's right?
What's...
I want to be with Jin.
If I were hurting Jin by making animations, I'd stop animating...
I see.
Would Jin like you if you did that?
Sorata likes that I love to draw manga.
What does Jin like about you?
Do you have enough chopsticks on that side?
Yeah, um...
Hey, do you have a minute?
I've never seen her study so hard.
But Dad opposes her applying to Suimei.
If you talked to Dad, he'd allow it in an instant.
But Yuko asked you to do it.
Fine. Tell Dad...
that I need to talk to him when he has a moment.
Okay.
Come on. Your noodles will get soggy.
I know what I told Mom, but...
How am I supposed to convince Dad?
Opportunity waits for no man!
What's wrong with you?! What are you doing?!
If you make excuses by saying you're not ready...
and let opportunities pass you by,
you'll never get another chance!
D-D-Don't get so close!
N-N-No!
You wanted to talk to me, right?
Your mother told me.
What?! That's why you came in here?!
Spit it out.
I wish you'd waited until I got out of the bath.
There's one thing I need to teach you...
about life while I still have breath in my body!
Opportunity waits for no man!
I got it already! I wanted to talk about Yuko!
She seems to be taking studying seriously,
so can't you at least let her apply to Suimei?
If she tries and fails, Yuko will accept that, won't she?
Then, if she ends up attending a school here, won't that put your mind at ease?
You've grown, a little.
Hey! Who are you talking to?!
My son.
Please just die already!
So, which girl are you serious about?
You just don't give up, do you?!
Why are you asking me questions like we're kids at a sleepover?
You shouldn't be so indecisive!
I don't remember raising such a girly-ass son!
Can you just stop now?!
But it's your life.
Live it how you want to.
If you intend to go to college, don't worry.
I'll make enough money to pay for your and Yuko's tuition.
I won't say it again.
Dad.
Well, in Yuko's case, it's probably...
impossible for her to get into Suimei.
I think so, too.
Hey, Sorata.
What?
I stayed in too long, and now I can't move. Help me.
Apologize first!
Apologize for making me think you were even a little cool!
It was probably a mistake to drink.
Don't get into the bath drunk!
Don't be stupid.
What man could talk to his own son sober?
You're the girly-ass!
Sorata...
There's more?!
Happy New Year.
I'm not in any mood to celebrate the new year!
Staying up to watch the sunrise is a bit over-the-top for a New Year's celebration.
And the man who suggested it passed out.
What does Jin love about me?
Onii-chan, thanks for talking to Dad.
It sounded like he would have allowed it even if I hadn't said anything.
Yeah, but thanks anyway.
I'm glad you're my brother.
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
Mashiron, thank you.
I can't stop animating.
I just end up doing it.
Even now, I want to go back to Sakura Hall and make more.
My head's full of thoughts of background animations for this shot,
and original screen splashes of that character!
Jin said he liked that about me!
I like you the way you always are, too.
S-So do I!
Me, too!
Yeah! I love myself, too!
Sorry for making you all worry!
But I'm okay!
Misaki-senpai.
I'll make Jin's anime!
Using the script Jin wrote, I'll make an animation myself!
Let's do this!
I'll make Jin look at me this time!
I'll make my presentation a success!
I-I'll pass my audition!
Huh? Oh!
I'll get into Suimei!
Meatball beam, meow!
Don't use your special ability!
I like meatballs.
I hope Jin gets accepted.
All right! Let's sprint towards the rising sun!
Misaki-san, there's a cliff over there!
Let's shout Geronimo and take the plunge!
Is she a monster?!
A paratrooper?!
A superhero?!
This girl's just plain weird!
The three days after Misaki-senpai's revival flew by...
And the day came for us to return to Sakura Hall.
Onii-chan, I'll be coming next month for the entrance exam!
Kashiwameshi Bento
Our winter break's finally over.
Yeah.
Are you nervous?
Are you?
Things are just getting started.
Yeah.
I'll have to face that nervousness again...
But this time, I'm even looking forward to it.
Both of us living together.
It's my job to make dinner.
She stuffs her face with my potato and onion miso soup.
Every time I see that smile, I...
