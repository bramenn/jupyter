Can you kill them?
Yes, Master Naraku.
Inuyasha, Miroku and... Sango?
Yes, Master Naraku.
I made him forget.
I erased all his memories.
Bring me Tetsusaiga, Inuyasha's sword.
And I will give Kohaku eternal life.
What? What am I doing?
Sango, what's the matter?
Nothing... Couldn't sleep. That's all.
I'm gonna kill him...
although I feel badly for you.
I already told you... he is not Kohaku.
Kohaku... my kid brother...
could never slaughter an entire village.
I will deal with him and Naraku at the same time!
Is it that simple?
He looks exactly the same.
Can one hate and forget so easily?
Don't underestimate me!
I am a Demon Slayer!
I don't fall for dirty tricks!
If I were in your position...
I probably couldn't do it.
Looks exactly the same...
So he can't hate or forget.
Inuyasha is speaking of Kikyo.
Inuyasha...
Be on your guard.
We are surrounded.
Kohaku!
Hey Miroku! What're you doing?!
Your Wind Tunnel isn't completely healed!
Yes... but...
Stop it, Miroku!
Don't hurry to death for these small fish.
I just have to go and get rid of their boss!
Go away, vermin!
You plan to fight me with that level of skill?!
Finishing blow!
No! Don't kill him!
Damn!
I'm easy! Way too easy!
It's okay to kill'im!
This is Naraku's trap!
I've got to kill him!
You're right. I deserve to die.
What?!
Father... our friends... the villagers...
I killed everyone.
That's why... I deserve to die.
Hey! What're you doing?!
What're you up to?!
He's trying to extract the Sacred Jewel fragment!
That's why he slashed his own back...
Kohaku's life is sustained by...
the fragment of the Sacred Jewel imbedded in his back.
If the fragment is removed, Kohaku will die immediately!
Stop!
Huh?
Sango!
- Sango! - Sango!
What're you doing?! Sango!
Is he testing me?
Does he really believe that I will take the Tetsusaiga to him?
I...
I...?
Kirara!
Wait, Sango! What're you doing?!
I have no other choice.
My only choice...
My true desire...
Let's go, Inuyasha!
What's the matter, Inuyasha? Miroku, too?
How about it, Inuyasha?
I still smell it.
That boy... Kohaku's blood is still here...
It still reeks of it.
Naraku is luring us to him.
My Wind Tunnel is sealed...
and the Tetsusaiga was stolen.
Who cares! I still have my fists!
This castle...
Kohaku.
Kohaku!
First, put down the Hiraikotsu.
Naraku...
Good work, Sango.
You brought me the Tetsusaiga, Inuyasha's sword, as promised.
Let me see Kohaku.
Only then will I hand over this sword.
Naraku! Turn Kohaku back to his former self!
Right now!
Killing me won't help.
You should know that already.
It's all the fault of the Sacred Jewel.
Demons desiring the Sacred Jewel attacked your village.
Your father's death...
that your brother's soul now wanders...
are all because of the curse of the Sacred Jewel.
Stop this nonsense!
You killed my father and comrades!
Just because you covet the stupid Jewel...
you did it all!
People die because of the power of the Sacred Jewel...
and people live because of its power.
Do not despise the Sacred Jewel so much.
Kohaku was revived because of the Jewel's power.
The promise was to exchange Kohaku with the sword.
What will you do?
You despicable!
What promise?!
This is my answer!
You are...
the Young Lord of this castle!
Kagewaki was a fine lord.
He gave the slayers proper burials.
Oh yes... I was the one who ordered your care.
Did you kill him?
Kagewaki Hitomi...
But now, that is who I am... the lord of this castle.
Damn you!
Die!
Kirara!
Kirara! What's wrong?!
My miasma is stronger than any poison gas.
Not even you, Sango, can withstand it.
W-what?!
How about it?
Will you serve me in this castle along with Kohaku?
I remember Kagewaki telling you...
Return to the castle.
Don't make me laugh.
My only goal in life is to destroy you!
I will avenge my father and comrades!
I will kill you!
Kohaku, come!
Good bye... Sister.
Kohaku!
- The castle! - Is this it?
This is where Naraku is hiding!
Sango's voice!
Damn it!
Kohaku...
Kohaku!
Snap out of it!
Yes, Sango!
Kill him...
Kill your brother with your own hands!
And then pray...
that you want to continue living in this world...
that you alone want to be saved!
When you kill Kohaku...
and you are bathed in his blood...
the Sacred Jewel will glow brighter with the power of the Dark.
The more sullied it is...
the more beautifully the Sacred Jewel glows.
Kill you?
How could I kill you?
I...
can't kill...
Kohaku...
Sister!
- Sango! - Sango!
Kirara! Are you all right?!
He made her brother do this?!
This is terrible... How could he?!
Naraku... where are you?!
Come on out!
The brother who killed his father... and comrades.
His sister says she cannot kill him.
She loves her brother more dearly than her own life.
I do not understand how that can be.
Kohaku...
will regain consciousness in a little while...
Inuyasha...
this is exactly what happened with you!
Fifty years ago, with you...
What?!
He tried to make Sango hate her brother...
so that she would kill him.
Then the Sacred Jewel in his back would become more evil.
The same trick he used to make Kikyo and Inuyasha...
hate each other, and fight!
I can't forgive him!
I'll never forgive this!
Kikyo died so that the Sacred Jewel would remain dormant.
In the same way, Sango refused to fight her brother.
Naraku's such a fool!
There's no way Sango would have done it.
Sango is a kind sister who loves her brother.
Huh?!
A miasma!
Foolish mortals!
Drown in this sea of miasma!
Father said you're getting better and better.
Really?
Really!
It's the first time Father praised me!
I feel sorta awkward.
Sango, you mustn't move yet.
Sango, keep still!
I gotta lot of things to say to you!
So don't you dare die!
It's my fault...
But...
But...
I know!
Naraku has the Sacred Jewel fragment!
There!
Naraku! Prepare to die!
W- what?!
Naraku, you are sooo...
despicable!
This woman...
What is her power?
With hardly any effort...
she can purge the miasma... the poison vapors...
This power belonged to Kikyo...!
It can't be...!
I won't let you go even if you beg forgiveness!
That is none other than Kikyo's sacred arrow!
That means the girl is!
She did it!
She purged the miasma and located Naraku!
Kagome!
Do not let Kirara go!
Kohaku!
Kohaku!
Kohaku!!
The castle disappeared!
It was a phantom castle.
Inuyasha!
Naraku got away?
Yes...
I don't see any Sacred Jewel fragment.
I see...
I'm sorry. I couldn't finish him off.
No need to apologize.
Without you, we'd all be dead by now.
Kagome...
I've never seen you so awesome before.
Inuyasha... we must destroy Naraku.
No matter how hard it is.
We must work together...
No, Sango! You mustn't move!
Sango!
Please stop her!
Sango intends to go somewhere.
Where in the world do you intend to go?
I'm sorry. I cannot stay with you any longer.
Sango...
we all know that you were being blackmailed by Naraku...
over your brother.
That's why!
I will betray you again!
As long as Naraku has Kohaku under his control!
Sango!
Sango, you intend to go after Naraku alone?
That's the only way...
But that's...
We'll all save your brother.
He's not an opponent one person can handle.
Okay? First, we must tend to your wounds.
You... why?!
Will you stop yapping?
Just stay together!
'Cause you fight well!
Inuyasha...
See? Even Inuyasha, whose sword you stole so easily, agrees.
Okay? So no problem.
You make me sound like a half-wit.
No, you're just generous.
Sango, do you dislike us?
It's all my fault that this happened...
and I may end up doing something like this again...
and yet...
Poor Sango... How hard it must've been for her.
It'll be all right, Sango.
We're with you now.
There's an herb that will cure Kirara...
who was stricken with poison when she bit into Naraku.
Inuyasha and I go in search of this herb garden...
and we come upon a huge demon working in the field.
He seems strong...
and he looks fierce...
but this demon has very kind eyes.
Next on Inuyasha: Jinenji, Kind Yet Sad
Don't miss it!
