Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
Big Sister!
Good morning, Big Sister!
Good morning, Skuld!
Hey, let me help you, Big Sister!
I'll help! I'll help!
All right, then here...
Okay! All right, then here...
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I call him Mitaro, the All-Purpose Slicer Dicer!
Now your workload will be so much lighter!
Do your thing, Mitaro!
I'm sorry!
Thank you. That was a big help.
Big Sister.
It's all right.
Skuld's been latching herself onto Belldandy for the past few days...
She was separated from her beloved sister. You can't blame her for wanting a tt ention.
Oh, listen to you! I'll bet deep down inside you're jealous!
Huh?
You should let her mother you once in a while, too.
What?
You're not going out somewhere, are you?
Yes, I'm going to class with Keiichi.
All right, we'll see you later!
See you later! All right, we'll see you later!
Huh? Ah!
You stay at home like a good little girl, now.
See ya!
Oh, come on, you guys!
Ah! Teaching a Lesson Called Competition?
Big Sister?
Well, well! Good morning, Skuld!
Big Sister, are you going to that place you call'college' again today?
Yes. There are so many people there at college...it's a lovely place to be.
You should come sometime, too.
I wouldn't go there for anything!
I know! Big Sister always goes off with Keiichi because of this thing!
Huh? What a primitive 2-wheel drive rig!
I can't believe he's making my beautiful Big Sister ride this piece of junk!
First, this side car... Whoa!
What's up with this inefficient fuel pump?
Huh? Just look at that clutch! It's absolutely pointless!
Oh my gosh, now that I can see... there's no oil cooler!
Well, if it isn't Megumi!
Good morning, mister!
That bike you fixed for me the other day...it's running like a dream!
You really saved the day!
It's my way of saying thanks.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure! You're always such a big help, Megumi.
Well, then, if you insist...
The boss at the fish shop wants you to take a look at his bike, too.
I'd really appreciate it!
Sure! I'd really appreciate it!
Morning, Kei!
Oh, it's you, Megumi. What's up? It's so early in the morning...
I just thought I'd join you guys for breakfast!
Oh, man...
Oh, come on! Here. I brought you a gift. The grocer gave it to me.
You really do get around, don't you?
So unlike our Keiichi here!
Oh, back off, will you?
Hey, gimme some more! Oh, it's you, Megumi! Good morning!
Oh, it's you, Megumi! Good morning!
No way! Oh, it's you, Megumi! Good morning!
Belldandy. Can I join you for breakfast?
Stop it, Urd! Belldandy. Can I join you for breakfast?
Please come in.
I did it!
To think that I made all these modifications in such a short time...
What did you do to my bike?...I must be a genius after all!
Oh, don't thank me, it was a piece of cake...
I forgot I was going to take it apart...
She's so cute! Is this your daughter, Kei?
Are you crazy? That's Belldandy's little sister, Skuld.
Hey, you!
Don't treat me like a kid!
I may not look it, but...
So you attached a turbo, huh? I may not look it, but...
I may not look it, but...
A turbo in front of the carburetor...
Hey, I'm talking to you! A turbo in front of the carburetor...
I bet you had a hard time keeping the carb balanced on both sides, right?
It would be a no-brainer with something simple like a car.
Oh, but you could always go with a fuel injector, right?
But then there'd be the problem of heat...
You did great, making a turbo this small.
She's good! You did great, making a turbo this small.
But unfortunately, now the body's off-balance.
What? Are you criticizing my work?
According to my calculations, it should be 1.5 times faster than before!
Sure, it's probably gotten a speed boost, but...
Keiichi! Get on and prove me right!
Hey, stop that! Keiichi! Get on and prove me right!
Good idea. That'll give you a better idea.
Keiichi!
Oh, man, I knew it...
Who are you, anyway?
Huh? Who are you, anyway?
She's Keiichi's younger sister.
Nice to meet you!
I don't care if you're his sister... you're not getting away with this!
This is for whoever dares to mock my inventions...
Now that's quite enough!
Hey! Big Sister!
Those who use such violent words end up with violence in their hearts also.
Big Sister, give it back!
Belldandy to the rescue! Big Sister, give it back!
If you're going to compete, it must be on equal footing.
You three must be sisters after all...
Yes, Big Sister! You three must be sisters after all...
Oh? Think so?
Okay! We got it!
Well, hello!
Monsters? Well, hello!
What are you two doing here?
Don't sweat the details.
Den-chan missed you since you've been such a stranger these days, Morisato.
You keep your mouth shut about that! Come on, you're too old to be so shy!
Um...so what is it that you've got?
It's this.
A Robot Battle?
These two will each build a robot, and compete against each other.
A Robot Battle?
Rocket Punch!
X-1 Beam!
Cool!
I don't think that's what he means.
Who said you could look into my mind?
What's it gonna be? Will you accept this challenge or not?
I think I'll give it a shot.
Megumi!
Well, building a robot sounds like fun!
All right, then!
I'll take you on, show you my power, and rub it in your face!
Whoa, calm down.
I'll be looking forward to that.
You're treating me like a kid again!
Just you wait!
I'm going to build the most awesome robot and cut you down to size!
Hey! Skuld!
So that's settled.
You can leave the rest to us!
All right, then... farewell, all!
Anything can happen with those two, huh?
So let's see...
Basically, it's a barrel-collecting race.
The robot that gathers the most steel drums inside that ring wins the game.
Steel drums?
It's so like those two to come up with something like this.
You can use whatever materials you want, and any number of people.
And it looks like you'll be allowed to use equipment and facilities at school.
Those are my kind of rules!
All right! I'm going to start designing my robot right away!
Will it be all right?
I think it will be a good experience for Skuld.
I wouldn't be so sure...
Huh?
Urd?
I do understand the reason why you fired up Skuld like that, but...
Now then, I think I'll go explain the rules to our little Skuld!
Urd...
VICTORY! SKULD!
We are Skuld's groupies!
We're here to put our lives on the line to support Skuld! Yeah!
We're the Megumi Morisato Fan Club Community!
And together we're going to guide Megumi to victory! Yeah!
What... what is this?
My, you two are both so popular.
That's not the point...
Well, this is all pretty crazy, but let's both do our best, okay?
No way am I ever gonna lose to you!
Really!
Telling us we can use any materials we want, and this is what they provide?
Behold, these are your materials!
What? Behold, these are your materials!
Humans are just too uncivilized to be true!
Hey, look, there's Skuld!
I'm in the Megumi camp.
So you're with the enemy?
Since when did you go for that type?
Who knows what they're thinking... Since when did you go for that type?
Hey, it's Skuld!
Hey, Skuld! Good luck, okay? We're all rooting for you!
Are those the parts for your robot? Want us to help you carry them?
Huh? Um... you see... I'll be fine!
Boy, they gave me such a shock!
That's it, you can just bring that here... this way.
Hey, thanks!
Use that pipe for reinforcement, okay?
Okay. Use that pipe for reinforcement, okay?
So she can't even build a robot by herself!
If that's the case, it should be a cakewalk for me!
Good work!
Thanks, that's just what I needed.
Skuld?
Bam! Pow! Whack!
Yoo hoo!
Hey, what are you doing here?
I came to help out my darling little sister, of course!
I'll be just fine on my own!
You heard her.
Isn't there anything we can do to help you?
It's a lot of work for just one person.
I'll be all right. I can build a robot on my own just fine!
I'm not like that Megumi!
Skuld...
She's late coming back, don't you think?
You're right, she is.
I'm sure she's wallowing in the joy of creation.
I'm going to go help after all...
Just leave her alone. I'm going to go help after all...
Isn't that why you encouraged her?
If you go to her now, she'll only be more stubborn about it.
Hey, so you're actually worried too, Urd!
Not a chance! That kid doesn't even look up to me as her older sister.
Alrighty, I'm going to take a bath.
Belldandy?
Do you think I was mistaken?
Huh?
Skuld can be a little obstinate at times, but I think...
So that's why she's had such a chip on her shoulder...
But there's also an aspect of herself that differs from Megumi.
That's what I wanted her to find it on her own...
So you tried to make them compete.
Yes, because I was sure that those two could become friends, but...
It'll be all right.
I mean, she's your sister and Urd's, right?
Keiichi!
Still, we can't just leave her to fend for herself like this...
Right!
I've made a lot of headway tonight!
So what do you think, Big Sis...
I'm going to call it a day!
What was that? Don't tell me it's a spy?
This is great!
It makes me happy to hear you say that!
But is it really okay to treat us all like this?
All of us in the Nekomi Shopping Arcade are rooting for you, Megumi!
Come on, everyone, dig in and do your best for her!
Right!
It's Skuld.
Is she doing reconnaissance?
I don't care if she sees what we've got! Is she doing reconnaissance?
Hey, why don't you come eat with us?
She ran off.
I guess she really can't stand me.
I hear she's building her robot all by herself.
She can do that?
Well, I wouldn't know, but...
By herself, huh? That's pretty amazing.
But the thing is, there are limits to what you can accomplish on your own.
I'm going to win no matter what!
ROBOT BATTLE
Banzai! Banzai!
Banzai!
Skuld!
Big Sister...
GO! SKULD!
MEGUMI!
Thank you all for waiting!
The Robot Battle between Skuld and Megumi Morisato will now begin!
First... in the red corner...
With Skuld wielding the controls... a machine called Hysteric Wheel 1.
In the other corner... With Megumi Morisato at the controls...
I've built a perfect robot! I wonder if you can defeat my creation?
I'm impressed that you've built a robot like that by yourself.
But I know that victory will be mine!
Ready... fight!
See that? My Hysteric Wheel 1 was designed to...
She made that? I know she's my sister, but that's terrifying.
And you two are so alike it's terrifying!
How can you be so relaxed?
What's going on here?
Don't you remember the last time?
It's true your robot has overwhelming power, but it's not maneuverable enough!
Oh, no!
Megumi Morisato is on a tear, collecting those cans!
Can she hang on for the win?
Okay, I'm just going to cruise to victory!
What are you doing, Skuld?
Take a closer look at the rules!
What?
Those are my kind of rules!
I see.
What an appalling rule!
Come on, both of you! What an appalling rule!
Come on, both of you!
Your robot doesn't have any offensive functions.
Just let me reduce you to scrap!
Oh!
Let's go!
Seniors! What happens in a case like this?
Since she gobbled up Skuld's robot, I'd have to say that means Megumi wins.
Hey, no fair!
There's nothing for you to latch onto inside that drum... you can't destroy it!
No way, no way, no way! This just isn't fair!
Okay, then! You asked for it!
A self-destruct device, for crying out loud...
Wow, pretty wild, huh?
It'll be a lot of work, cleaning up this mess.
Seniors! What happens in this case?
Tamiya and Ohtaki ran off! Get them! Seniors! What happens in this case?
Tamiya and Ohtaki ran off! Get them!
It was a tie! Give us our money back!
I don't believe those two...
You did a good job.
Big Sister...
We're going to win next time, all right? I want you to let me help, too.
Big Sister...
Now, I want you to make up with Megumi.
You built an awesome robot.
So did you...
Next time, let's build one together. I bet it'll be a lot more fun that way.
Yeah, I think so too.
But...
Huh?
Skuld!
My robot was way more awesome than yours!
Come back here!
What a little brat...
To think that's my own sister...
She's just like you. To think that's my own sister...
What did you say? Just how is she like me? Tell me how!
You know, in that way...
You'd better say we're not alike right now! Say it!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a wing!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a wing!
I love you so much it hurts...
And it hurts me that I can't tell you how I feel.
You and I have matching hearts...
So we must share the same scars deep down inside.
But now that I'm in your arms, I think I can catch...
Nobody else matters... All we have to do is gaze at each other.
It's all right for your heart to flutter... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
Don't run away from happiness.
I'll always be waiting for you.
So come rest your wings anytime.
It's all right to cry... anytime you need to.
I just want to see you again... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
I just want you to be happy.
That which has been created... it is called a'Machine.'
A machine without a heart gains a soul thanks to the goddess' love.
