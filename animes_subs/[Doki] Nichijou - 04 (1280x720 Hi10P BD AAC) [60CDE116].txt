H!
O?!
I do fall in love!
I just realised it for the first time
That I had fallen in love
Twenty-four hours a day thinking of you, you and nothing more than you!
It's something I wasn't consciously aware of
Somehow ( somehow) I'm feeling different from the usual
With you ( the two of us) and our dull chatter
Don't tell me ( mutual love?) Nope, it's a one-sided crush
This is bad! Our gazes met!
What, what? Why is my heart pounding like this?
Did a short circuit just make a mess out of my mind?
This is my first time... feeling like this...
I wonder if I have a fever
Suddenly and precipitately, love has arrived.
Instantly igniting my face into a bright red
T-That's stupid?! My hands are shaking
Is this really what they call love?
I-I did it! A conversation filled with stutters
This awkward silence... *mumble mumble*
Your... ( Your...) I want to know your feelings.
O-One-sided love
First love! The usual way to school
The shining light. I do fall in love!
I feel I could fly towards the sky
O-One-sided love

H H!
Woke up in the morning, brushed my teeth
In the blink of an eye, it's 10pm
Today, we laughed a whole lot
We had a great time
At times, with my friends, acting like fools, being noisy
Fluttering, our eyes met.
It's a coincidence, right?
I wouldn't call this my first love
It's not my character.
Say, will we be able to meet again tomorrow?
As my eyelids close
I see you sparkling all over the place
Today was fun, too, wasn't it?
I'm in love
So happy, so happy
It is my pleasure to meet you, my new-found love.
Surely, we'll meet again tomorrow
Have a good night
We'll meet immediately in our dreams
So have a good night

Narration: Obara Noriko
The discipline at this school has been lacking lately.
I'd like you to be a little more strict on keeping students to the school rules, Sakurai-sensei.
Yes!
I-I'll do my best!
That's right, I became a student guidance counsellor in order to change myself!
I'll have to make sure that they stick to the rules.
What's this?
What's this, all of a sudden?!
But it's not good, since it's only allowed during lunchtime.
E-Excuse me!
What seems to be the problem, Miss?
Sorry, um... I don't think it's good manners to eat while walking...
How rude of me.
My stomach wouldn't stop growling,
most likely because I didn't eat breakfast.
I'll take it off now, sorry about that.
S-Sorry.
It's okay!
As long as you understand, it's...
I'm glad that he understands it when I tell him.
Tell them...
What do you mean, delicious?!
Suddenly shouting in the middle of the hallway?!
You should think about your surroundings for a bit!
U-Um, you can't take something like that to school...
Misato, let's go.
Ah, okay.
Sasahara, I have something to talk to you about during lunch, so...
This school might really be lacking discipline.
That was rude.
Tachibana Misato didn't mean any harm either.
Please forgive her.
Ah, yes.
Sorry about that.
E-Excuse me!
What is that?
That frilly thing around your neck...
Ah, this?
Yes.
I was thinking it's kinda cute.
The ordinary days that we have been living might actually be a chain of miracles.
As it were, it might be something like that.
Ah, hm, so in other words, what is that frilly thing...
It's ***, I say.
Well then, Miss, we shall meet again in class.
Hmm...
Thank you... very much.
Wanna try it?
Sure, it looks fun.
Excuse me, Nakanojou-kun!
Yes, what is it?
Ah, nothing really. Just you know...
I was thinking that having a hairstyle like yours at school is a little...
Ah no, only a little, just a little...
Ah, I'm sorry.
I didn't quite hear that, can you say it once more...
From the sides...
It won't grow from the sides!
Daruma-san has...
Everyone went home.
Nano, what are these?
They're unripe ume.
I've been thinking of making some umeboshi at home this year.
Umeboshi... sour.
Ume are good for your health, you know.
Besides, if you put it in your onigiri, the rice won't spoil.
Nano!
You can't!
I haven't even said anything yet.
We just bought a lot of snacks recently, haven't we?
We'll finish those first, and then we can go buy more again...
Oh geez, Professor...
You can't have those today. That cat...
Um...
Sakamoto.
Ah yeah, we also promised to buy Sakamoto-san's food,
so snacks are...
Pocky.
Ah, um...
Yes?
Can I help you with anything?
Ah, this, this is...
Ah, the snowman? It just came in today.
Is it a snack?
Ah, maybe it's something like shaved ice.
It's cold.
It's cheap!
You're gonna buy it?
N-No, I'm only taking a look.
Ah, a snowman!
I want it.
Hey you.
Y-Yes?
If you're not going to buy it, can you give it to me?
I-I'm buying it!
Why can Nano buy the things Nano wants,
but Professor can't buy the things Professor wants?
No, as I said, this is just...
Since Nano is buying the things Nano wants,
it's okay for Professor to buy the things Professor wants too!
I want it, I want it, I really want it, I want it!
I got it.
Just one pack, okay?
Really?
Nano, I love you.
So that's how you ended up buying that thing?
Yes, it's cute, and since it's cold, it feels good.
Professor, it's done.
Yes!
Nano, gimme more!
Yes, yes.
Seriously, you guys...
And where's my food?
Ah!
Shaved ice?
They want me to eat... shaved ice?
First comes rock, next comes paper, rockscispaper doesn't count,
rock-paper-scissors!
It's going up
The screw!
No no.
Okay, the test is over.
Good heavens!
This is a wig too.
When you think of what other people are looking for,
you might not know because there are so many other people.
When you think of what you're looking for,
isn't it a little bit of love?
After that, you've just got to pray to a god somewhere.
Well then,
a god somewhere, pleased to meet you.
Daruma-san...
Maybe you should stop that already?
They made me stand again.
I've adapted quite well to this body.
Just by looking at them, I can't stop drooling.
What's this?
Ah, Sakamoto-san.
It's umeboshi.
You can't eat them, because they're not done yet.
I'll use this to play with Sakamoto.
Ah, a foxtail.
Sakamoto, Sakamoto.
Hey, kid, I've told you so many times to put -san after it!
Ah, yeah. Sorry, Sakamoto.
Are you making fun of me?
It happened unconsciously. Sorry, Sakamoto.
You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?!
Well then, I'm going shopping!
Have a safe trip!
Seriously, the people here really haven't been educated, have they?
I'm sorry, Sakamoto, I'm not doing it on purpose.
I'm telling you, it's not Sakamoto!
Here, Sakamoto, I'll give you some gum.
How many times are you going to make me say it!?
Besides, have you ever heard of someone giving gum to a cat, you dumbas - Whoa!
Cut it out already!
I'm sorry.
Listen, I've told you before that I'm older than you two.
Adding -san when you address people older than you is...
I mean... that...
In other words, it is...
It means that...
So it means that...
Ah!
What is it?!
Can I go wee-wee?
Ah, yeah, go ahead.
Wee-wee!
You're taking it with you, huh?
From what I can see, there are only two kids living in this house.
I see.
No wonder they're not educated.
Which means, I'm the oldest in this house.
It can't be helped.
It'll be troublesome, but I'll act as their parent.
Seriously, I've been taken in by one hell of a house.
This is bad, yet it's so fun!
Sakamoto, what are you doing?
This is bad,
if she finds out that I was playing with the eraser,
my place as parent will be...!
My place as parent will...
My place as parent will be...
I might have slept for a bit.
Cats sure do sleep a lot.
Well, that's why.
That's why?
Yeah, that's why.
There are a lot of things lying around here, so...
First off, shouldn't you start by apologising to your elders?
This is bad, but it's really fun!
Whoa, Sakamoto, do it again, do it again!
Sakamoto!
Sakamoto, your leg!
Sakamoto!
N-No you're wrong, I was just...
I mean, didn't I tell you to put -san after it?!
I'm home!
Home run!
Mother!
Daruma-san has...
Daruma-san has...
Mai-chan is doing her hard-to-get jokes again.
It can't be helped.
For now, I'll take a jab at her.
Mai-chan, isn't that on the book?
Yukko, don't ever try to take a jab at me like that again.
When you take such a good jab at me,
it overshadows my funny man act.
No, it's that, you know?
I'm at the age where you start to unintentionally use English,
I mean...
But you know, it was difficult to figure out if that on the book was serious or a joke.
Well, how do you call it, I just had to take a jab at it.
It was difficult to understand?
You're seriously saying that?
It's because it's you.
Because it's you, I thought you'd understand.
No, I'm beat.
I didn't think you thought of me like that,
but I'm happy that you have faith in me.
Faith?
Yeah...
We're not friends,
so can you stop talking about having or not having faith in you?
Eh?
You don't need words between best friends, right?
Mai... chan!
Seriously, Mai-chan, it's okay to have a few words exchanged even between best friends, isn't it?
Mai... chan?
If you're all over me like that, I'll be troubled.
U-Um... sorry.
Stop it.
If you do that, I'll fall...
I'll fall even more in love with you.
It's okay to like me more, right?
We're best friends. Yo, best friend!
That's not the problem here.
We're not of the opposite sex, but it's kinda like I see you as one...
Sorry.
I can't say it... clearly.
Ah... um...
W-What is this?!
Somehow, I thought she was a bit odd today.
You see, you see!
She's talking more than usual.
She even said we should take a detour on the way home.
Was everything she did for the purpose of saying this?
I mean... since when?
Since when did she start to feel that way?
J-Just a second, M-Mai-chan...
H-How do I put it, I-I'm not really sure about those things...
I mean, it really is a bit too soon to say something like that.
I mean, we're still high schoolers after all!
That was a joke just now.
Super ultra great delicious wonderful...
Geez, stop putting on such weird acts.
I sorta believed you for a moment there.
I see.
Because it's you,
and you're quick on the uptake, so I thought you'd understand.
Well, I did understand a little.
That's a lie, right?
No, no, it's not a lie or anything.
It's like my head got the idea.
Like, I really did understand it.
Thinking about it, that was a weird conversation just now.
Didn't you just say you believed it?
I hate people who lie the most.
Sorry.
That was a joke too.
I can't tell if these are jokes or not any more!
You didn't notice it?
I had another one.
I don't know!
Which one is it?
When I said you're quick on the uptake...
That one?!
However, that one is somehow very easy to understand.
It's already been 40 years, this multi-unit apartment.
Try writing apartment wives.
You'll find an unbelievable degree of sexiness to it.
Next week's Nichijou is the fifth one.
Look forward to it.
