In the year 850...
The Colossal Titan reappeared and breached the wall.
And once again, humanity could not stop a Titan invasion.
Soldiers fell, one after the next, before the Titan assault.
And then...
Eren! Hurry!
Eren fell victim to the Titans.
Mikasa's amazing, though...
How does she move so fast?
No, I knew she wasn't her usual calm self.
I'll win, no matter what.
I'll live, no matter what!
When Mikasa faced certain death,
a mysterious Titan appeared that attacked other Titans.
Hearing the Heartbeat The Battle for Trost (4)
Okay, the starter device still works.
I gave you all my blades.
But please let me keep this one.
I don't want to be eaten alive.
N-No...
Armin...
I won't leave you here.
B-But...
Carrying someone,
while leaping through a Titan-filled area
Let's go!
No...
Stop it.
If you don't, I'm going to...
I'm going to cause another friend to die!
Wait!
Listen to me...
I have a plan!
A plan?
You two will have to execute it,
so you decide...
I know it's crazy,
but could we use that Titan?
That Titan?
It attacks other Titans...
It isn't interested in us.
Could we lead it to the supply area somehow?
If it defeats the other Titans, everyone might be saved!
Lead it?!
How would we do that?
I think it's fighting instinctively.
The two of you will defeat the Titans near it.
That should make it move to find more.
It should head toward HQ.
We can't do something that dangerous on a hunch!
But if it works, we might be able to destroy all the Titans around HQ.
It's worth a try.
Huh?
Are you serious?
Better to try something than to simply wait for death.
Let's go with Armin's plan.
Fight the Titans with another Titan?
Yes, that's right.
If we fail, they'll laugh at us...
But if we succeed, everyone will survive.
Let's prepare ourselves.
Fine... Fine!
Do I have the right?
The right to be in a position of responsibility?
No.
I have it wrong.
This is the time.
Now, with all those Titans concentrated there.
This is our chance!
Now!
We run into HQ right now!
It's our only chance...
Once we're out of gas, it's over.
Full speed ahead!
Jean!
Thank you.
Thanks to you, we made it out safely.
Huh?
It's thanks to you.
I told you you're cut out for leadership!
I don't know about that!
Damn it!
How many made it?
I took advantage of our comrades' deaths.
Many died at my command...
Aren't you guys with the supply team?
Yeah...
Stop it, Jean!
They are the ones who abandoned us!
Because of you, more died than was necessary!
Titans came into the supply area...
We couldn't do anything!
Doing something is your job!
Get down!
Damn it!
Too many people are in one place!
Hurry, get inside!
We can't all fit!
Where's Mikasa?!
She must've ran out of gas, and got eaten long ago!
This is normal.
This is reality...
Was my hope just an impossible dream?
I should've known...
that this is reality.
It should've been a simple enough realization
that we could never beat something so huge.
What?
Wh-What is that?
Mikasa?
That was close... I'm all out.
But we did it! We just barely made it!
Y-You're alive!
You did it, Armin!
Ow!
Your plan worked!
Everyone!
That Titan is an Aberrant that kills other Titans!
And it isn't interested in us...
If we can use it, we can escape!
Use the Titan?
A Titan helping us?
That sounds like a dream
It isn't a dream.
I don't care if it's an Aberrant or what...
We need it to stay here, and to keep fighting.
That is
our most realistic chance for survival.

Titan Size Comparison Chart
D-Don't worry.
It's stronger than an average Titan.
As long as it's out there raising hell,
they won't destroy this building!
How much do you know about that Titan?
We can worry about that once we get out.
You're right.
We'll get out of here first.
We found it!
This is military police stuff...
It was covered in dust.
Are scatter shots really enough?
Will these rifles
actually be of any use against the Titans?
I think they're a lot better than nothing.
If there are still only seven 3- to 4-meter class Titans in the supply room,
even this may be enough firepower to blind them all at once.
First, we'll use the lift to
lower a large number of people through the central ceiling.
They'll fire in the faces of the seven Titans in unison to blind them.
And then,
the next instant will be critical.
The seven of us hidden among the ceiling beams
will strike the blinded Titans in a coordinated ambush.
In other words, in this plan, all of our lives
will depend on this one strike.
The seven must kill seven Titans at the same time, with a single strike.
The seven will be those of us whose skills give us the best chance, but...
I'm sorry to make them bear the weight of everyone's lives...
It's all right.
Regardless of who goes, everyone dies if we fail.
The risk is the same.
But is the plan I conceived...
really the best one?
It's our only option...
There's no time,
and this is the best plan we'll have.
We just have to give all we've got!
It's fine.
Have confidence in yourself.
You have the ability to find the right solution.
What?
That ability has saved both Eren and me.
When was this?
The lift's ready!
The guns, too!
They're all loaded!
You just don't realize it.
We'll talk later.
Yeah...
But can we kill Titans without Maneuver Gear?
Sure, we can.
They're 3- to 4-meter class Titans.
The target will be easy to hit.
Yeah, no matter what the size,
the target is always that one spot on the neck...
One meter long, ten centimeters wide!
Or we can shove this up their ass.
These are their only two weak spots.
I didn't know about that!
We can do that?
I'm just finding out now, too.
Reiner...
Those may well end up being your last words.
It's okay...
Their numbers haven't changed.
We're still a go!
Keep calm!
Draw them in!
Wait.
Avoid fighting from a disadvantage.
If you don't want people to die.
Finish them all with this strike!
Wait.
Ready...
Fire!
Got mine!
And the others?
U-Um...
So sorry to attack...
Shit!
from behind...
Sasha and Connie...
Hurry and help them!
I'm...
So sorry!
Mikasa!
You saved me!
Are you injured?
No, thanks to you...
Then stand.
Sorry...
It was nothing.
Hey, now...
That was close, Annie.
I'm really glad you weren't hurt.
We got them all!
Begin the resupply.
We did it!
Okay, we're saved now.
The Titans aren't coming in!
It's thanks to that other Titan fighting them.
I accepted defeat before the Titans...
I'm so ashamed!
I'll despise you all you want later!
Let's get out of here!
I don't think I'm cut out to be a leader...
Don't say things like that again.
I hope you won't get mad when I say this...
But you aren't a strong person.
So you can relate to how the weak feel.
In addition, you excel in sizing up any situation.
Isn't that why you immediately know what has to be done?
You gave the right orders.
That's why I could jump, and it's why I'm alive.
You ready?
Let's get out of here!
We'll all head out together!
Scale the walls!
Rendezvous with the rest of the army! Go!
Mikasa?
Mikasa...
We have to run.
That Titan...
Cannibalism?
Can it not regenerate its body?
I thought that if we could solve the mystery of that Titan,
it may give us a way to overcome our bleak predicament...
I agree.
If it gets eaten, we won't learn anything.
Let's try to keep it alive by killing the ones clinging to it.
Are you insane, Reiner?!
We can finally get out of here!
What if it might be able to help us?
Might it not prove a greater weapon than any cannon?
Help us?
Are you serious?
That's...
the Aberrant that ate Thomas...
Come on...
It doesn't need help.
I guess it's finally exhausted itself...
That's enough... We're leaving.
That thing couldn't possibly help us...
A Titan is still a Titan.
What is it?
Mikasa!
It's Eren...
He's regained the limbs he'd lost...
I saw a Titan swallow Eren whole.
I saw...
What happened?
Does this mean
that Eren did all this?
I'll kill every single Titan.
That strong emotion had turned Eren into a Titan.
But the Garrison decides he is a threat to humanity,
and turns their blades on him.
