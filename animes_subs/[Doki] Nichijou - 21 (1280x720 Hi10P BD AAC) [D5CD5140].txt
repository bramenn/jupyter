Hey!
( !)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
All right! I'll say it!
You are my best, best friend!
(Fly!) When I joke around a bit,
(Shine!) You joke around more in response.
(La La La) Nothing is better than this!
(Why!) Even if something bad happens,
(Fine!) I immediately forget about it!
(La La La)
Always keep it going!
Being together 24 hours a day isn't a problem.
Just like twins, or a parent and child, or clone cyborgs.
Then isn't there no reason to clear your eyes?
Those are completely, completely different issues.
(Fight!) Even when I get in a fight with you,
(Down!) even when I get really down,
(Shy!) even when I feel like I want to be alone,
before I realise it, you're right there; we'll be together even in death!
I wonder why it is.
I want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
time goes 100 times faster!
It's fun, isn't it?
It's way too fun!
As expected of my best friend!
What is it?
The synchro is amazing!
Always making an uproar,
bothering the neighbours a lot.
What time is it now?
And then yo de le hi hoo!
I don't get it at all!
So re doh si la!
It's better than I imagined, the absolute best!
Even if I say this and that, we're still friends. (Hooray!)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
Cha Cha La Cha La Cha Cha!
The colours of the flowers
The shadows of the clouds
They're so nostalgic
Those memories
They are left behind
A window to days gone by
It's time to leave the nest
Today is goodbye
Farewell, and so long, teacher
Farewell, and so long, my friend
For the sake of a beautiful tomorrow

Sakurai-sensei
Takasaki-sensei
Narration: Shimamoto Sumi
It's finally lunch!
I guess odd things happen from time to time.
It must be a miracle!
I wasn't punished for forgetting the homework for Takasaki's class.
It must be my lucky day!
You should still do it.
Anyway, Mio-chan, how about you buy me juice to celebrate this miracle?
Aioi,
I need to speak to you about today's homework.
Come to the faculty lounge.
Okay.
I'll treat her from time to time.
I guess Nee-chan has friends over again.
Hey...
Are you getting anywhere?
With what?
What do you mean, with what?
Geez.
I mean your relationship with Sasahara!
Why do I have to get married to him?!
I never said that.
What do you mean, two children?!
Wah, I get it!
I admire your plan for adulthood!
Adult...
How about you, Websey?
Huh, me?
I'll pass.
Come on! Tell me!
There's someone you like, isn't there?
Come on!
Tell me!
Fecchan, stop that!
Okay, I give up!
I Christian Chivu up!
I won't stop until you tell me!
Okay, I'll tell you!
If you don't tell me, I'll tickle you to death!
I said I'd tell you!
I'm sorry.
It kinda got addicting.
Well?
Who is it?
Who is it that you like, Websey?
It's more like someone that I'm interested in, however,
I don't know his name.
He has a mohawk.
Oh.
Him, huh?
Oh, you two know about him?
Of course we know about him.
He's a bit of a celebrity at our school...
Websey, why do you like him?
He looks like a punk.
Isn't someone who's a bit bad more attractive than an honour student?
But he's completely bad.
He has a mohawk, after all.
But I recently saw that punk speaking politely.
No way!
There's no way that's true, right?
With that mohawk!
But that punk...
He was watering the flower bed.
Wow, that's unexpected.
Oh, and also,
he was sticking some kind of bottle in.
Whoa, I like that gap.
His head is like a cut pineapple.
He's a nice guy that drips pineapple juice.
That kind of niceness is worth a lot of points.
I'd like a nice guy, too.
What about you, Fecchan?
Is there someone you like?
Who, me?
Well, I...
Sasahara...
Koujirou.
I saw Sasahara feeding his goat on a rainy day.
I get it!
I get it!
That kind of niceness!
Huh?
I don't think it's particularly nice!
So how about you, Fecchan?
Huh, what?
Is there anyone you like?
Well, there's no one I'm interested in right now,
but I'm not interested in weirdos like you two are.
Start!
One point!
Ouch!
Hold on.
Here.
Oh, thanks!
Huh?
Give me your hand.
I finally have a day off,
but I passed it eating, sleeping and raising vegetables,
just like every other day.
Well, my days are peaceful.
I guess that's nice in its own way.
I wonder if something interesting will happen...
Hello.
Casual?
Sakurai-sensei...
Casual?
Takasaki-sensei, are you out shopping, too?
It's tied up!
Also, running into each other on a day off...
It feels like I'm seeing something very private...
I feel extremely moved!
Oh, I'm sorry!
Are you hurt?
Oh, sorry!
I just felt moved.
Sakurai-sensei, are you out shopping, too?
Oh, yes.
Green onions were on sale, so I bought a lot!
Green onions, huh?
If you wanted bamboo shoots, you could have told me,
and I would have given you some.
Bamboo shoots?
Well, I have a bit of a garden at my home.
Well, what can I say...
I see!
That's amazing!
Meeting on a day off...
It feels like it's fate.
Like we're bound by fate.
Is this coincidence causing this feeling?
To be honest, I'm surprised myself.
This is the first time I've felt this way.
I wish I were a green onion.
Are you okay?
You look like you're in pain!
Would you like to go rest somewhere?
I'm sorry!
I'm completely fine!
I wasn't thinking about anythin -
Would you like to go rest somewhere?
Thinking...
Would you like to go rest somewhere?
Would you like to go rest somewhere?
Would you like to go rest somewhere?
That's amazingly enough...
Now! Sakurai-sensei, there's a park over that way!
Let's head that way!
Oh, yes!
Well...
I would never have thought this would happen.
Isn't this what you would call...
Aioi!
Sakurai-sensei, let's go to that empty lot, instead.
Why is Aioi here?
If she were to find out...
Oh, what are you two doing?
You idiot!
This is sort of... well... um... that!
Good day!
Geez, I didn't know that you two were dating.
You idiot!
Don't tease teachers!
But you guys seem so happy!
You...
Sakurai-sensei, good morning.
Way to go, you two!
Hot stuff!
You idiots!
Don't laugh at it!
Geez, those brats.
I'm, well...
I'm sorry about all this trouble.
Oh, it's fine.
I'm actually kind of happy.
Good enough!
What's wrong with me?!
There's no way it would end so nicely!
Anyway, I need to...
Wow, that surprised me.
Oh, shoot!
What are you doing, Takasaki-sensei?
Oh, what a coincidence! It's Sakurai-sensei!
And Aioi!
It's Aioi, right?!
I must not have been paying attention.
I didn't see you!
Aioi?
It's you, right, Aioi?
You sure look like Aioi.
Well, anyway,
I have to do that, so I'll be leaving.
I guess...
Sorry for calling you out so unexpectedly.
Were you able to sleep yesterday?
Yeah, but I had a weird dream.
A weird dream?
Well, I dreamt that we kissed right here.
Shall I make that dream come true?
Professor, would you like some snacks?
Do you actually love me?
The result of a month's research.
I have learned that every Saturday...
It's almost time for her to come out.
I will trail her when she comes out after shopping.
When we reach an area without anyone around,
I'll use this Mr. Short Circuit,
which I didn't get the chance to test before,
and then I'll take her home.
It's perfect.
I will definitely study you today,
Shinonome Nano.
Huh?
Why isn't Shinonome coming?
Do you not always go to this supermarket?
No, I've waited this long!
If I leave now, there's a chance I'll miss her.
Huh?
Oh, it really is you, Nakamura-sensei.
Good day.
It's Sideburns, who teaches language!
Hello.
You weren't in your lab coat, so I didn't realise it was you at first.
Sideburns has come at a bad time.
If he doesn't need anything, I hope he'll just leave.
If Shinonome were to come at this time...
Well, Nakamura-sensei, your casual clothes are a bit boyish.
It's kind of cute.
Oh, not really...
No, it's such a difference from your regular lab coat.
It makes you look innocent...
I'll retreat for today!
Huh?
Nakamura-sensei?!
Have you thought about what you'd like to do...
I have.
Would you like to get a job?
Would you like to go to school?
I understand.
The Wood Cube isn't here...
But how did it disappear from the safe?
Well, there's a reward for finding it.
So I'm fine with it.
The Advisor found one of them earlier.
There's only one left to find?
I need to get serious.
If I show my worth here, I could gain favour with the throne.
Hey, look over there.
Give back the Wood Cube.
Hey, hey.
What are you saying, young lady?
How did you get in?
Are you a stowaway?
If you are, there's a severe punishment.
It's either a minimum of 10 years in prison...
Just kidding -
Number 22!
Why, you! What are you doing?!
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait!
I'm all right.
I just let my guard down a bit.
Leave this to me.
You've got a pretty face, but you act a bit rough, little girl.
Hey,
playtime is over, all ri -
Is he okay?!
No, he's dead!
That bastard!
A stowaway is after the Wood Cubes?!
Move around to the rear!
Surround her!
Everyone, please be quiet.
There's no need to get so excited.
Advisor!
Leave this to me.
The Advisor should be able to do something in this situation.
She came aboard all alone to get the Wood Cubes.
She must be a spy from somewhere.
But that amazing strength...
If I could tame it, it would become a powerful weapon for our country.
Luckily, I also have a Wood Cube.
If this is what she wants,
I might be able to get her to change sides if I make a good offer.
This is the Wood Cube that you're after.
How about it? Why not...
Advisor!
No!
He's dead!
This is bad!
That bastard killed the Advisor!
You bastard!
Don't think you'll get out of this alive!
This is bad!
This is bad!
This is extremely bad!
What's wrong, Scholar?!
What's bad?
It's very bad!
Just now, she attached a Wood Cube.
What's more, she already has another one attached by her ear.
That's another Wood Cube!
She has gathered the Wood Cubes!
But even if she's gathered them,
if she doesn't know how to summon the ancient weapon...
That's right!
We still have a chance!
Shut up!
According to this Netherworld Encyclopaedia,
a person who obtains the Wood Cubes...
In other words,
a person who obtains the Wood Cubes...
What was that?!
Could you explain it again?
Yeah, explain it once more!
In other words -
I shouldn't need to say it!
It's foolish to approach her!
The world could be destroyed!
It's over!
It's over!
Don't despair!
Nothing comes from despair.
Not even a bit.
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Listen. If we fight head-on, even for a bit, we're finished.
We have no chance.
However!
Even for a bit, our opponent is all alone.
While we, on the other hand, have numbers.
Therefore!
We should all try to take back the Wood Cubes together.
I'll take the lead!
After me!
Captain!
No! Leave me! Go!
B-But!
You fool!
I don't recall raising you to be so soft!
It's over.
The Advisor was killed.
The Captain can't move.
We can't do anything more.
One...
One for all...
Captain!
I've been in this troop for 12 years now.
These 12 years of memories...
Ending like this...
To that monster...
In a place like this...
In a place like this...
Like I'd let that happen!
It's over!
No! I don't want to die!
I'm gonna go wash my face.
So obvious!
Oh, boy.
Well, I've got nothing better to do,
so I guess I'll play along with the kid.
Creating free time is a skill.
Your hair is messy.
It's kind of cute.
It's kind of cute.
What the heck am I doing?!
I went first.
I had a very nice bath.
I'm an Ai-Ai-Gasa.
Why don't you try drawing me once in a while?
Write your name on the right,
and on the left... You don't have any name to write?
Next time on Nichijou: Episode 22.
Look forward to it!
