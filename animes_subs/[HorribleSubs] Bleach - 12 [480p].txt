Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
All right, explain to me... the rules of this battle.
Well use this.
Huh? What is that?
Its bait for Hollows.
If I crush it and scatter it around, Hollows will come.
What?!
The victor will be whoever kills
the most Hollows that gather in 24 hours.
Well? Isnt that easy to understand?
Quit kidding around!
Youd endanger the lives of the towns people
just for our battle?!
Just who do you think you are?!
Dont make such a fuss, braggart.
No need to worry about other people.
Ill kill every single Hollow that comes.
If you are confident that you can protect others from Hollows,
then you should accept this challenge.
Thats number one.
What kind of face is that, Ichigo Kurosaki?
Change it back!
Chase away the Hollows!
Soon, the town will be overflowing with Hollows lured here by the bait.
Lets just say the die is cast.
Huh?!
Isnt there something else you should be doing,
besides grabbing onto me?
Thats if you really want to protect
as many people as possible from the Hollows...
Why you-!
Have you forgotten?
Hollows tend to attack those with high spiritual energy.
Yuzu! Karin!
Dammit!
Hey, wait Ichigo!
He hasnt noticed, after all...
That there are people around him
with high spiritual powers besides his family.
But dont worry.
Ill kill every one of them.
And...youll realize how weak your own power is,
here at the point of no return.
I detest Soul Reapers!
Its true. Youre the cutest of all, Mika!
Truly? Can I really believe you, Yoshi?
Of course...
How's about a hug?
Huh? Someone will see us!
Dammit! Quit making out in broad daylight!
Youre just ghosts!
Its all right. No one is looking.
Mika!
Yoshi!
Hey! Arisawa! Breaks over!
Arisawa!
Coming!
Tatsuki!
Orihime?
Do you have a moment?
Thats right...that day when I went to Orihimes house...
I have almost no recollection of that day.
Just that I felt so much pain...
and that I thought I saw someone who looked like Rukia...
At first, I thought I was dreaming.
But when I mentioned it to Orihime the following day
she had seen the very same dream.
And ever since that day,
I started to see strange things.
Tatsuki...
I can see you! Hey Tatsuki...!
You and I are butt friends!
Aghh! Its so annoying!
Huh?!
Oh, Im sorry. What is it?
Umm... its not that important, but...
Hey, whats going on?!
The windows on the first floor are shattered!
Anyone hurt?! I wonder what happened.
Lets go, Orihime.
Okay.
Okay! Let's go!
Hey Kurosaki! Hurry and kick it!
Number three!
Huh?!
Shes probably gone somewhere to play around this time.
Where could she be?! Dammit!
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
What is it, Urahara?
Huh? Dammit!
A Hollow... at a time like this!
Sorry Urahara, well continue this later.
What? The signal is gone.
I get it. Ichigo is doing pretty well.
Gone again? Whats happening?
Its not really broken, is it?
Again?
So many Hollows, at this rate is...
not...possible.
What does this heavy and agitated Sprit Energy mean?
Just what is happening?!
Move!
Where are you?!
Hurry it up, Chad!
If you keep stalling, lunch specials will be over!
Ill make you pay the difference!
Huh? That wont do.
Damn right that wont do! So move it!
What a bad feeling.
Ive had this feeling before...
Hmm?
Cut it out, will you?!
Im eking out a living with what I make from my part-time job!
My lifes as tenuous as a bugs!
Im not like you carefree students who can eat just by being alive!
Sorry.
I risk my life just for a bowl of rice!
Repeat it!
I-I risk my life just for a bowl of rice.
All right. If you get it, lets go!
Unless its on sale, dont buy meat!
The expiration date is just an approximation! Right!
Whats happening?
Was that a gas explosion?
What is that?
Just that area is...
Hey Chad! Are you all right?!
Lets get out of here!
Shigeo! Harutoki! Run-!
Hes coming after me?
I see. Well then...
Chad! Where are you going?!
I dont know what that big thing is,
but if its targeting me, then its simple.
I just have to run.
Run to where theres no one around.
Run!
Oops, sorry.
Kurosaki! Whats with you anyway?
You space out then kick the ball just anywhere.
Are you serious about playing?!
Huh?
W-What, y-you wanna fight?
Then bring it on!
Well show you...
Im sorry. I think Ill go home, after all.
Huh?
H-Hey! Wait, Kurosaki!
Its no good today...
I keep thinking about that weird air
and cant concentrate on soccer.
Ill take a bath and go to bed early.
Youre Ichigos friend. The one with the parakeet.
Ichigos sister?
Whats a grown up like you doing here alone-?
W-What is that?!
W-Wha-?!
What is it?!
It stopped moving.
Is it watching our moves? Or...
Damn it!
If I could see him a bit more clearly...
Its coming again.
Huh?
What is it?
Just what is that thing?!
Can you...see it?
See?
What are you saying?!
Its so clearly visible!
You...
Mister, behind you!
Gone? Whered it go?
Where are you looking, Mister?! To your right! Run!
Mister, dont tell me you cant see him?!
Which means, you really dont see him.
It cant be helped then.
Hold me tight. Ill see him for you!
Wha-?! You cant!
I can! Let me do it!
Its not the first time Ive seen a monster like that.
Its bothering me...
what do they have to do with Ichigo?!
Ichigo?
To the left. Dodge!
Right!
Mister!
Are you all right, Mister?
Mister!
Mister!
Kurosaki!
What happened?
This guys covered in blood!
Did you fight him?
Did you beat him up?
Stupid! Dont come! Get away!
What a thing to say!
Were just worried about you!
Youre always like that!
Leave it to a girl!
I'll say! Let's go!
Dont tell me you hit someone again, Yasutora?
Whats the point of hitting someone?
You hurt those who hurt you, and whats left?
Yasutora, you are strong.
You are big. You are beautiful.
You were born with everything people wish from God.
People who are different are suppressed.
I dont know about other things,
but thats the way things are in this world.
But Yasutora...
You must be kind.
You must learn why you have such big, strong fists.
Find out.
I know, Grandpa.
My fists arent big so that I can hurt others.
My body...is big...
so that I can protect.
I know all that.
I know that...
But thats why...
even just a little...
I want you to lend me your strength!
What...is that arm?
Mister!
Mister! Your arm...!
Is it all right?
So un-cool!
Why would you make a gesture like that?!
Mister!
I dont understand...
That armor on my right arm appeared out of nowhere.
And from it... something amazing was released.
And suddenly, I could see that monster so clearly.
I dont understand... not at all.
Just...
Youre not hurt, Ichigos sister?
Stupid! Youre the only one whos hurt.
I see. Thats good.
Its not good!
Whats good about getting hurt?!
If even one person gets hurt, its NOT good!
Thats just the logic of guys who want to be all heroic!
In that sense, youre just like Ichigo!
Aghh! I cant stand it! You just wait here!
Ill call my dad and have him treat you!
Dont move from that spot, Mister!
Ichigos sister, huh...?
Just like Ichigo...
the way she kicks.
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Into a somber Karakura town under attack by monsters
suddenly appears the Fighter of Hope, Orihime!
With six henchmen, she tosses out evil one by one.
Inoue, what are you talking about?
Next week's preview.
That's too convenient.
