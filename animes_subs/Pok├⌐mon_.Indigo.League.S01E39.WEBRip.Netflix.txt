Dark City.
This looks like the next stop on the journey for Ash, Misty and Brock.
Who knows what kind of chilling new challenge
our heroes could face in this dingy, deserted ghost town.
This place gives me the creeps.
It's the middle of the day and there's nobody around.
-What's the deal? - Yeah.
Get back inside this house right now. What if there are Pokemon trainers out?
Huh?
Why would she be afraid of Pokemon trainers?
-Pika! -Hey, you!
Go, Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Huh?
They're little kids.
I'm sorry, but you guys were throwing those rocks at us.
Chu!
-You guys are Pokemon trainers right? -Huh?
Yeah, my name's Ash.
I want to become the world's greatest Pokemon master.
I'm Brock, and I want to become the world's best Pokemon breeder.
And I'm going to be the world's best everything.
My name's Misty.
Hey kid, cut it out, will you?
We don't care who you are.
If you work with Pokemon, you better get out of our town now.
Mm-hm.
Why? What's wrong with Pokemon?
Stop it, boys!
I apologize.
These children don't mean to cause you any trouble.
Come to my restaurant, and I'll explain everything.
Well, okay.
In Dark City, there are two Pokemon gyms: The Yas Gym and the Kaz Gym.
The two gyms are in the middle of a gang war,
and they'll hire any wandering Pokemon trainers
as soldiers to battle for them.
-I get it. -Chu.
So that's why there's nobody out on the streets here.
Hey, Pikachu, pour some ketchup for me, will you?
Wh... Whoa! Whoa!
-Pika. Pi, pika. -But I don't see.
What's the point of fighting each other like this?
-Pika! -Huh?
They claim that whatever gym wins will become an official Pokemon gym.
-That makes sense. -Chu.
Becoming an official Pokemon gym's a big honor.
It's them!
Huh?
-What is that? -The Yas and Kaz Gyms are fighting again.
If you don't want to get dragged into this,
you'd better go upstairs and hide.
Get ready! Today, the Kaz Gym Is going to crush you!
Guess again! The Yas Gym will wipe you out!
Go, Electabuzz! Thunderbolt, now!
We can't let them win. Attack, Scyther.
Scyther!
Scyther!
- Ah! - Let's get out of here!
Is it always like this?
Yeah.
Now I can understand why everybody around here
hates Pokemon trainers.
That's not even a Pokemon battle. It's more like a street fight.
Hmm, those bullies.
They don't even understand what it really means
to be a Pokemon trainer.
Hey, cook.
Give me the lunch special for 30 people.
We've got to be at Kaz Gym in less than an hour.
Throw in an order of onion rings while you're at it.
I'd like to, but you see,
the Kaz Gym hasn't paid its bill in over in two years.
There's something familiar about them.
What? Are you telling us we can't put this on our tab?
Do you realize we're Kaz Gym bodyguards?
Give us the food or else...
I'd like to but I can't. I don't want any trouble.
You won't give us lunch, but you don't want trouble, huh?
You're talking to the wrong customers if you don't want any trouble.
Please leave me alone. I don't want any trouble.
Trouble?
Trouble.
- I can't resist, Jessie. - Neither can I.
-Prepare for trouble. -Make it double.
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above.
- Jessie... - James...
Go get them, Arbok!
Weezing, attack!
-Arbok! -Weezing!
-Meowth! -Ah!
It's Team Rocket. I knew it.
Stop them, Pikachu!
Pika!
Starmie attack!
Go, Vulpix!
Vulpix?
-Rare. -Medium.
Well-done.
-Meowth! - Ah!
-Nice to see you leave! -Don't come back any time!
Are you all right?
Thank you for saving my restaurant.
Aw, it was fun to beat Team Rocket.
You didn't do anything.
It was Brock's Vulpix that did the work.
Uh, yeah, I guess you're right about that.
That was great. I saw everything that happened.
Huh?
Excuse me, is there some way we can help you, miss?
Those were some of the strongest bodyguards from Kaz Gym.
How did you overpower them so easily?
You must be a very gifted, very famous Pokemon trainer.
Please, please. You must tell me your names.
Gee, that's very nice.
If we get mixed up in this gang war,
it could ruin our reputations as Pokemon trainers.
-Just make up a name, quick. -Uh...
-I'm, uh, ketchup. -Pikachu.
-Ketchup? -Uh, no.
My name is really Tom Ayto.
Well, my name... My name is Ann Chovie.
-Huh, huh, huh? -Uh...
Oh, and my name Is Caesar Salad.
Oh, Tom, Ann, Caesar,
Would you consider joining our cause at the Yas Gym?
Unlike those animals from the Kaz Gym,
we at Yas are truly worthy of becoming a Pokemon gym.
Uh, well, you better ask Ann Chovie.
Well, we can't do it. Isn't that right, Caesar Salad?
We'll do anything we can to help.
Pika!
Brock just can't say no to a pretty girl.
-Wow. -Please, come right in.
Yas leader. Let me introduce you to a great trainer.
This is Pokemon trainer Tom Ayto.
He's brought his two disciples to help us.
He brought us?
Pikachu.
I saw them defeat the bodyguards from Kaz Gym like they were nothing.
They're really strong trainers.
I'll decide just how strong they are.
Scyther, go!
Scyther!
Pika!
Scy!
Scyther!
Scyther!
Scyther, what is it?
-Whoa! -Scyther!
Whoa, hey!
-Scyther! -Stop!
Scyther, return.
Scyther!
That's the first time my scyther has been frightened so badly.
You are a powerful trainer.
-Well- -You must work for me.
-I need your strength. -Pi.
-First, I have one thing to ask you: -Pi.
Why is it so important that this should become
an official Pokemon gym?
That answer should be obvious.
What faster way is there to make money in today's world
than by becoming an official Pokemon gym?
Well, if that's your reason,
-I won't become your bodyguard. -What?
Pokemon are not just tools for fighting or a way of making money.
And I know because I plan on becoming a Pokemon master.
I won't help you.
That was dramatic.
Whoa!
That was pathetic!
If you won't join us,
we'll make sure you don't help anybody else.
Yas Gym, attack!
Ah!
-Wow, that was a close one. -That Yas Gym plays rough.
I think the Kaz Gym plays just the same way.
They think Pokemon battling's like plain old fighting.
Imagine if they became an official Pokemon gym.
Kaz and Yas keep getting stronger Pokemon
and they wreck our town with their fighting.
If this keeps up, people will think all Pokemon trainers are dangerous.
-Yeah, that Scyther is really scary. -Pikachu.
I wonder how we get out so easily.
I don't know.
Scyther!
Scy!
Oh, ketchup.
Scyther and Electabuzz are both rare Pokemon.
They are able to distinguish colors and become enraged by the color red.
Like the ketchup.
Scyther is the Yas Gym's strongest Pokemon,
and Electabuzz is the Kaz Gym's strongest Pokemon.
Huh?
If we work together, we might just be able to beat them.
Listen up!
The Pokemon league inspector will be coming through town any minute.
We have to run those Kaz Gym losers out of town before he gets here.
Pokemon league inspector is on his way.
We have to completely crush those Yas Gym trainers
and show him we're the best.
This town's only big enough for one gym.
Ka. Pika. Ka.
All right, weather looks fine and everything is all set and ready to go.
I'm only going to say this once to youse guys.
Kaz Gym's going to be the official gym of Dark City.
Save yourself some trouble and just clear out now.
I'm afraid you have things all mixed up.
You're the ones who'd better clear out and fast.
Leave now or we'll crush you like the slimy insects you are.
Ooh! Now you're going to be sorry you ever heard the name of Kaz Gym!
Today's the day we finally destroy you once and for all!
I've heard enough!
Electabuzz, go!
Get them, Scyther.
Scyther, scy!
Monchan!
Hitmonlee!
Electabuzz, send them flying with a thunder punch!
Don't give in, Scyther! Power up with sword dance, and cut attack!
Scyther!
Scyther!
-When do we get our turn? -It's over already.
Meowth!
Go, Electabuzz! Just burn that Scyther to a crisp.
Don't give in, Scyther. Slice that Electabuzz to ribbons.
It's time. Do it.
Heave-ho!
Huh?
Ah!
Hey, what's going on?
Huh?
Scyther!
-Ah! My best gym suit! -Scyther!
Huh?
Huh?
-Scyther! -Huh?
What are you doing, Electabuzz?
Hurry up and crush that Scyther!
-What's wrong with you, Scyther? -Scyther!
-Cut attack, now! -Scyther!
Ah!
Scyther!
-Scyther! -Wait! Stop!
You're making a mistake. I'm your trainer, Scyther!
What are you doing? No!
It's me, Electabuzz, your trainer!
You don't have the right to call yourself Pokemon trainers
after what you've made them do.
But please, you've got to save me!
-Scyther! -Ahh!
Scyther!
Scyther!
Think they've had enough?
I think they've learned their lesson.
All right, Bulbasaur, I choose you!
Bulbasaur!
Bulbasaur!
Scyther!
-Huh? -Scy?
-Huh? -Ther?
Scyther!
Scyther!
Scy...
-Scyther! -Electabuzz!
Well, I hope you two have learned your lesson.
Bulbasaur.
Shall we join together then?
At least until we've destroyed those meddling kids.
-Chu! -Huh?
Come on!
Attack those kids on the roof now!
They're going to have to learn the hard way.
-Pikachu. -Pikachu!
Pikachu, thunder attack!
Pi... ka-pika!
Chu!
- Now then. - Huh?
Why can't we all just get along like friends?
Like friends?
-Now we'll teach you. -I suggest you run.
-Hold it right there. - Huh?
-What? -And who are you?
I'm the inspector from the official Pokemon League.
Poke Ball, go.
Chansey, Chansey!
Chansey? That must mean...
That's right. My true identity is Nurse Joy.
Uh...
I could never allow people who use Pokemon for nothing
but street fighting to open an official Pokemon gym.
-Please, Nurse Joy. -Won't you give us another chance?
Only if you're willing to start over from the beginning.
Of course we are.
Just tell us what we should do, Nurse Joy.
There's someone here who can do that better than I can.
Who? Me?
Oh, please. Please teach us how to act.
Uh, well, you see,
Pokemon are really our friends, so we've got to be kind to them.
But what about Pokemon battles?
Of course, you fight them as hard as you can,
with all your strength, trying to win.
With all your strength? Isn't that the same as fighting?
No, no. Not at all.
Sure you try to win, but you don't try to beat each other.
Huh?
What is Ash trying to say anyway?
Heh, I don't think he knows himself.
Now, first, you'll have to fix everything you broke in this town.
At once, Tom Ayto!
Huh?
Oh, I should've picked a better name.
It looks like they've all had a change of heart
and decided to become true Pokemon trainers.
Thanks!
You did it, Ash.
No, I didn't do it all by myself.
We all did it together.
We were wrong about Pokemon trainers being bad guys.
Now we all want to become Pokemon trainers.
Right.
-We think Pokemon are the coolest. -Just like you.
Oh, I'm not. It was nothing.
Can we have your autograph, Pikachu?
Pi? Pika?
Oh, well, Pikachu really is the star.
-Goodbye now! -We'll miss you!
Thanks for helping us!
Now Dark City's a lot brighter, thanks to our heroes.
Those kids really appreciate me.
We'll miss you...
Pikachu!
After saving the town and making some new Pokemon fans,
our heroes are moving on to their next adventure.
Well, that was a complete waste of time.
Looks like we're through.
Huh?
Unfortunately we're not quite through yet.
Huh?
Scyther!
Scyther!
Somebody...
Help!
