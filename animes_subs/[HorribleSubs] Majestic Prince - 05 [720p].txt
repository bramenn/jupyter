Operation: Infiltrate a Planetoid Base
They're fast! I can't process their data quick enough!
My unit feels heavy!
Did it get fat?! Did it?!
There is gravity since we're on Earth!
Crap! I can't keep up with them!
Guys, get your acts together!
Your controls will go bonkers if you panic!
Right back at you!
Isn't that Team Rabbits?
Supposedly their AHSMB units are under repair.
Since they're still considered students, they're getting a supplementary lesson.
Is it just me, or do they suck even worse now?
Who're the other three?
Probably teachers.
Students can't pull off moves like those.
I've gotta do something!
Now that it's come to this...!
Shining Miracle Turn Smash!
What gives?
What the hell was that?
And here I put my faith in you!
Fine! I'll charge ahead!
Whoo boy...
Their formation is a mess...
What the heck was that Miracle-whatever?
My secret move.
Yeah, figures. Most heroes have a secret move, don't they?
I know, right?
We don't need one!
But heroes use secret moves to save the day.
I was sure I could pull it off...
If all we needed was confidence, we'd get 100's studying by ourselves!
I never got to show my stuff...
Yo!
You weren't looking too hot out there, huh?
Freakin' out after that string of losses?
Your training session is over.
Team Rabbits, everyone is to submit your
own personal analysis on why you lost.
Assemble in the Meeting Room in 30 minutes with Team Doberman.
Over.
See ya later.
Sirs, thank you for the lesson!
That's Team Doberman for ya!
They're scary!
Weren't they also students here?
Supposedly they were highly accomplished.
A joint meeting...
Does that mean we're working with them on our next mission?
That'd be super awesome! All three dudes are stud muffins!
I'm amazed you can act so carefree
after nearly getting killed in that last mission.
Fear and romance are two different things!
Man!
I guess the Fail Five are still the Fail Five, huh?
How come they get to pilot cutting-edge fighters?
My entrance may come surprisingly soon...
I thought my Likeability Stats would go up after becoming a wee bit famous.
You can't blame them for feeling that way.
When you get down to it, our team only won that very first battle.
They're blasting us on the internet again...
Don't bring that up. You'll give me another ulcer.
Your AHSMB units have been fully repaired.
You will be transferring to Star Rose tomorrow.
Upon arrival, we will commence a co-op mission.
What's the matter?
Ma'am, what if we fail again...?
Thinking like that will only hinder your performance!
You'll be fine!
This time you've got Team Doberman with you.
Lt. Commander, I have a question!
I've been meaning to ask this for some time.
Go ahead, Lieutenant.
Please tell me your personal address and when you're off duty.
Randy, we're in the middle of a meeting!
You shouldn't ask such shameless questions.
Don't be such a stiff!
If ya don't ask stuff like this when you can,
you could forever miss the boat!
With you as our clown of a leader,
people keep calling us the Bummer Three,
the Comedic Three and Trio Dobermans.
The Bummer Three?
Just what I'd expect from our seniors!
What's wrong with being the Bummer Three?!
And why do you always act like you're better than me?!
Just because we're classmates doesn't mean you can walk all over me!
It's the sub-leader's job to guide the leader down the right path.
What are you, the disciplinary committee?!
Pardon?
Why must you always act so cool?!
What are you going on about in the middle of a meeting?
Do you think you're on the Cool Committee?!
Sorry, but I don't have time to play.
You should try to act a bit more like a leader!
Wh-what?!
If there are no further questions, this meeting is adjourned.
I'm sorry. My team always acts like this.
I-I see...
Quit acting like you're excluded from our antics!
Ow, that hurts! Randy!
I give up! Uncle, uncle!
Thank God they aren't as scary as I thought.
What was that? I couldn't hear you?
In fact, they're funny.
You want me to stop?
But they're still cool!
And they saved our hides!
They're totally the hero type!
I'll really let you have it next time!
I swear, you never change!
Neither do you!
Excuse me! Thank you for saving me the other day.
Uh, aren't you Red 5's pilot...?
I'm Izuru Hitachi.
It feels like ages since I was here last.
You've got it rough, huh?
They're sending you out hunting when you're still just a student.
People are gonna say what they're gonna say; don't worry'bout it.
But I do!
Whenever I get sent to battle, I wonder if I'm doing enough.
You've survived this far! Isn't that good enough?
But I want to become a hero!
A hero?
So? Why do you want to be a hero of all things?
Because I think they're great!
I-I see...
All right.
I'll tell you what it takes to be a hero. You must be...
Good looking?
Right, it's all about the looks!
To be a hero, you gotta be the best looking
member in your group and get all of the girls.
Aren't I a prime example?
Y-yeah...
For the record, you...
Yeah, you aren't as handsome as me, but you're plenty good looking!
Don't worry, you'll become an amazing hero.
I guarantee it!
Is-is that right...?
Let's see, what else is there...?
Making decisions, never giving up and believing in your comrades.
Do you trust them... your friends?
I watched the footage from all of Team Rabbits' battles so far.
You try to do everything yourself while
desperately fighting to protect your friends.
You can't keep a team together if you don't believe in your men!
Now putting that aside!
The pilots for Unit 2 and Unit 3...
Which do you have your sights set on?
Pardon?
Aren't they both adorable? Which is your type?
Or are you already dating one of them?!
I-I couldn't possibly!
We're a team, so that sort of stuff is taboo!
What?!
I can't believe my ears! Just how old are you guys?
Kei, Suruga and I are 16. Asagi is 17. Tamaki is 15.
These are the best days of your life!
You gotta fall in love, squabble and then break up!
I really can't do that!
I know! Swap teams with me.
As of today, you're Team Doberman's leader; I'm taking Rabbits.
What?!
Of course, I'm just pulling your leg.
Your eyes looked kinda serious...
Listen.
In our line of work, you never know when you're gonna die.
Wouldn't you like someone to remember
who you were after you're gone?
Interact with as many people as you possibly can.
And make sure you remember each person you meet along the way.
You can borrow this.
Study this with the pilots for Unit 1 and Unit 4.
Does it contain footage from our battles?
Close enough.
Watch this and put your best foot forward!
I will!
Let's watch this together!
What is it? Does it contain video records?
Yep! He said to only watch it with Asagi and Suruga,
but I figured we could all watch it together!
What is this...?
That hurt...!
What the hell are you thinking?!
Well, this isn't exactly what I was expecting...
Pro wrestling?
Wh-what? What? Wh-what's the big deal?!
This is a bit much for me...
Why are you freaking out when you're the one constantly flirting with the ladies?
B-but this is on a totally different level...
I'm gonna pass!
Damn it! If we get caught, reports will be the least of our worries.
But I didn't mean-
Enough! This is truly ridiculous.
I just realized something important.
What is it?
This actress resembles Instructor Suzukaze.
Now that you mention it, I can see that...
I can't bear to watch!
The mission's name is Operation: MacLean.
You are to infiltrate the enemy base on Planetoid RA221 and blow it up.
Concentrate!
Sir, what do you think has gotten into them?
Beats me.
We don't know what to expect once you're in.
Although it isn't terribly big,
we believe the base's artificial gravity device is active.
We have outfitted your units for fighting in gravity.
Was our training on Earth before the mission
meant to serve as a simulation?
It is far enough away from the battlefield that we expect minimal security.
However, with weak transmission signals,
it will be impossible to communicate with us.
Gold 4 will be in charge of the bomb.
You will also use Gold 4's computer to detonate it.
This mission came out of nowhere, didn't it?
I can't believe we're destroying a base that's on the sidelines.
They're probably trying to make the other team look good.
That's what it'd take to save the MJP's face.
At any rate, they want evidence that we're winning.
I bet this is a co-op to increase the chances of success.
Yeah, but do you think we can handle this...?
Did you end up watching that video last night?
Not me! I didn't watch it!
Kei, are you going to tell the instructor...?
No, I wouldn't do that!
D-don't worry, Kei!
I'm sleepy after staying up all night,
but it was really refreshing.
Well? Was it a good picker upper?
Yeah, but I wound up showing it to Kei and Tamaki...
What?! Y-you've got some balls!
I'm amazed you've treaded grounds far more dangerous than I have!
G-gee, thanks...
Identifying the enemy base.
I'm forwarding the image.
What's going on here?!
Weren't we expecting minimal security?
What should we do? Withdraw and request new orders?
We can't reach our commanding officers.
We'll have to make the call for ourselves...
Let's carry out the mission!
If the base is crowded with enemies when it shouldn't be,
it means they're up to something.
We can't go back empty-handed!
Roger!
Crap! They found us.
But how? Do they have eyes and ears?
We'll take them on!
My team will draw the enemy fire
while your team carries out the mission!
But will you be okay?!
Don't worry about us!
There should be a gravity reactor at the center of the base.
Set the bomb there.
You'll do fine as long as you remain calm.
They want us to infiltrate the base by ourselves...?
My feet absolutely refuse to move!
Don't run away!
Use your willpower to rein in the JURIA-SYSTEM's survival instincts!
Go!
Y-yes, sir!
Let's go, Red 5!
L-let's fight!
Follow me, Purple 2!
H-hey, wait!
What'll we do if they find us again?
Doberman is attracting all of the enemy's attention.
We'll be fine... I think... maybe.
It looks like the base's guards still don't know we're here.
I bet we could get in through there.
Rose 3 can't fit through that entrance.
What?!
What should we do, Izuru? Leave Tamaki behind?
Make up your mind before the gate closes!
I'll stay behind.
Asagi...!
We'll probably need to shoot down any enemy fighters that come back.
Don't worry. We can handle it!
Thank you.
Kei, Suruga, let's go!
So this is a Wulgaru base...
I'm detecting a reactor located 250 meters below us.
If we blow that up, it should take out the entire base.
And the route?
Straight ahead.
Enemy fighters incoming at 2:00!
Suruga, protect the bomb!
Kei, can you activate the defense shields?
I could, but they'll make scanning and analyzing the area that much harder.
Got it. Then we'll plow through without them!
Good thing we trained on Earth!
Take the upcoming 90 turn to the right!
Next drop 90 vertically down!
The heat values are higher than I had anticipated.
The sudden fluctuation in heat is beginning to interfere with my sensors.
Can you at least tell what direction it's in?
If we follow the artificial gravity pipeline, we should reach the source.
Doesn't that mean we're gonna keep falling for who knows how long?!
They aren't holding back even though we're inside their base!
That's a given!
If we destroy this reactor, it'll send the whole base sky high!
It got hit somewhere along the line!
Crap! I can't set it like this.
What?!
The mission's a failure! We gotta retreat. Retreat!
What should we do, Izuru?
Izuru!
Suruga, can you fix it?
I don't think it's beyond me...
Then do it!
We won't make it back alive if we don't destroy this base.
This is our only option if we hope to survive this!
Are you serious?!
Suruga, you can do it!
I believe in you!
Izuru!
Kei, use your shields to protect Suruga.
I'll distract the enemy!
Darn! I guess this is the only way.
We're going to survive... Everyone is!
I wonder if everyone's okay...
Yeah...
They'll come back safe and sound.
Otherwise my stomach will kill me!
Hurry up, Suruga! Izuru is...!
It's all set! I'm a genius!
Great! Now let's withdraw.
It worked!
Sweet!
The secondary explosions are going off fast!
We'll get caught in the blast if we don't hurry!
Why?! What type of energy are they using?!
We won't make it...!
I suddenly accelerated!
The instinct to survive means serious business!
Tamaki, thank you!
Honestly, you three are lost without me.
Is everyone okay?
Asagi!
I was so sure I was gonna die this time...
Lookin' good there...
Hero of the Day!
Graduation
