Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
I don't have any sense... of being in school right now.
And I can't feel the fact that I was beaten by those guys from Soul Society...
almost killed by them.
Or the fact that she's not here right now...
Or the fact that not one of my classmates remembers Rukia.
Bohahaha...
Say, are you still into that?
So what? The time's ripe for me.
Orihime, have you made plans for summer vacation?
Not yet.
Orihime, then come and stay at my place.
My parents will be going abroad.
No way!
Why not?
I know exactly what you're up to!
Is this what it means... I'm not even thinking
to go back to the Soul Society? about bathing together or anything!
What are you blabbering about?!
You disappear from this world and from people's memories...
Every evidence of her existence disappears...
into white.
Now then... That's about it for reminders.
All right, students, don't die before September!
Class dismissed!
Yes!
That Ishida cut class, after all. I thought he might still remember Rukia.
Ichigo!
Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn!
Now then, where's the watermelon?
No! That's not it!
Thats right! Summer means the sea!
And the sea means summer!
And so, I, Keigo Asano, am planning
a 10-day trip to the seaside from tomorrow!
Fireworks, scary outings, and even a co-ed outdoors bath!
Lots and lots of things to do, both fun and embarrassing!
Sorry, I have plans, so Ill pass.
I'm sorry, too. I'm not too keen on the ocean.
I've got an inter-high tournament, so I can't go.
If Orihime and Tatsuki aren't going, then I guess I won't...
I can't go this time, either.
I'm sorry, I'm leaving for Hawaii tomorrow.
What?! With that older girlfriend?!
Actually, with her and her nine other friends,
so that makes 11 of us including myself.
What?!
What did you say?!
Don't tell me it's you and ten other girls?!
Why does he always pick on me?!
Strange...nothing feels out of place.
Even with Rukia gone, our world continues to turn...
I guess... Rukia was originally from the other world.
There was really no place for her here.
Then what'll I do?
Inoue...
What is it? Something wrong?
Where did Rukia go?
Why has everyone suddenly forgotten about Rukia?
I thought you would know, Ichigo.
Then Rukia returned to the world she came from?
Yeah...
But what a shock. That you were able to see through us.
Since when?
Ever since the incident with my brother.
Huh?
I see...
Yes...
I'm really grateful about that time.
You guided my brother...
I'm sure he's happy on the other side. I can feel it.
Really?
Yes.
I wonder if Rukia is doing well on the other side, too.
She probably has family and friends, right?
I have to bring her back.
Huh? But...if she's happy there...
She's in a predicament where she could be killed any time.
Who cares if she has family or friends over there?
As long as she's alive, they'll be able to meet again.
If she's dead, it's all over.
You already know what you want to do, right?
She was really here.
And her place is here.
Thank you, Inoue!
Chad...
Kurosaki Clinic
How boring! It's summer vacation and Ichigo goes off without us!
Yuzu, its about time you-
All right! How about sleeping in Dad's bed tonight?
Quit your jokes! And just talk in your dreams!
Oh, just thinking about that makes me feel uneasy.
Gee...those words really hurt me.
Good morning, Lieutenant Abarai.
Mornin!
Wait! Wait!
If you fly away, I'll get in trouble!
I guess I have no choice...
Hi! I'm Jennifer. I'm a blood type A, Pisces. E-cup bra size and-
What are you doing?!
Renji! Aren't you off duty today?
I'm here to check on the prisoner. Is she still sulking?
Im not sulking.
Then, why don't you eat?
I'm just not hungry, Mr. Lieutenant.‚Äù
What?! You got a problem that I'm the Lieutenant?!
Not really.
Way to go, Mr. Lieutenant!
You are so strong, Mr. Lieutenant!
Your eyebrows look so weird, Mr. Lieutenant!
Why you-! I'll kill you! Come out of there, you!
Say Renji...
Huh?
Am I really going to die?
Of course! It'll be immediate execution for someone like you!
I see.
I guess so.
Huh?
Stupid! I was just joking. Just a joke.
Which is it, idiot?
Who's the idiot here? Making us worry with your antics.
Captain Kuchiki is probably asking for clemency right now.
I wonder...
Fool! He's your older brother! As if he'd let his sister die.
No...
He would kill me.
Huh?
I know full well...
what kind of man he is.
Forty years after being taken in by the Kuchiki family...
he has never once looked at me.
URAHARA STORE CLOSED TODAY
Huh?!
What is this?!
Imagine! A huge cavern beneath the shop!
Pipe down! You don't have to yell. I'm pretty damn surprised.
Then that's fine.
Let's get started with this lesson or whatever.
All right, as you wish.
Dammit! What's the big idea?!
Hard to breathe, huh? When you're in the form of a soul.
Right now, your Soul Sleep, which is the wellspring of your spiritual energy,
and the Soul Chain, the booster, have been destroyed.
In other words,
your soul is like that of the average person who has no spiritual power.
So first, we must restore the spiritual power you have lost.
Then what do I do?!
Well, rather than explain it, why don't we just do it?
Hey, are you ready?
Nice to see you.
Lesson one! Please fight her.
Huh?
The rules are simple.
Lesson One will be over once either one of you are rendered immobile.
Please knock her out.
Are you kidding?! You expect me to hit a little girl like her?
I think it'll be quite difficult.
Please put those on properly.
Otherwise, you'll die.
This is so silly! No way!
See? Don't say I didn't warn you.
He isn't coming out.
Did he die?
I wonder.
Oh, there he is.
Oh, he's going after her!
Oops, he ran right past her.
Cripes! What was that?! If I get hit with that, Im dead!
Hey! How do I put this on?!
Ichigo, your forehead! Your forehead!
Huh? Like this?
Take this! Power of justice!
Armor of justice! Justice headband! In place!
Okay, got it!
Awright! As if I can do that!
See? No time to feel embarrassed.
Take this! Power of justice!
Armor of justice! Justice headband! In place!
Well, well, he actually did it.
Why you-!
Behind you! Behind you!
Aw man...!
Awright, come at me!
Dammit! This thing isn't any good!
Unless I run around like this, I'll be killed!
Wait a minute!
If I can run around,
it means I'm keeping up with her speed.
Then...!
Come!
Oh?
Hmm...
I can do it...
I won't aim for her face. Just a little blow to her headgear.
Then, because of the difference in size, I can...
Dammit! I got her face!
Safe!
One more time, please.
Congratulations!
Huh?
Lesson One is cleared!
Huh? Why? I lost to her, didn't I?
Oh, I didn't say a thing about downing Ururu to clear Lesson One.
But...
After all, she has the fighting skills to counter Soul Reapers.
No way can a human soul beat her.
By the way, are you still having trouble breathing?
Huh? Now that you mention it...
Which means, the restoration of your spiritual energy was successful.
This lesson was for one-shot battles.
Whether you could dodge the first attack or not.
Spiritual energy increases fastest when the soul is in danger of being destroyed.
If you can raise your spiritual energy sufficiently,
then you can dodge the punch and its all good!
And if I can't...
You'll die.
Why didn't you say so first?!
I had faith in you... that you would succeed.
Now then, your spiritual energy is back.
So...let's celebrate and...
Huh?!
Go straight into Lesson Two!
Lesson?
Are you interested in taking it?
B-But, so out of the blue like that...
Rather, the problem is... The cat.
What do you mean?
Hmm...
Ichigo has begun preparations to enter the Soul Society.
If you also want to use the powers that have awakened inside you,
then take my lessons.
You can decide whether you're really going or not after that.
I'm going.
Chad...
I won't force you.
Oh! There! There!
Uryu! Hello!
Huh? Orihime! Chad!
What are you doing here?
We asked Yoruichi to follow your spiritual aura.
Yoruichi?
What are you doing? Camping?
No!
You're training, huh?
Who's there?!
Where are you looking? Over here.
I'm Yoruichi.
Huh?! A cat?! A cat is-?!
So? What's the big deal just because a cat can talk?
Don't be such a wimp.
Yes, Uryu. It's no big deal.
No... I don't think it's strange if one is mildly traumatized by it.
Men have such a hard time adapting to things.
I'm sorry. But what did you want with me?
Actually...
Ichigo is going to the Soul Society?
Ichigo is going to rescue Rukia.
So I thought we should tell you, too...
Unfortunately, it's got nothing to do with me.
Rukia's life is in danger!
I'm a Quincy and I can't forgive myself for losing to a Soul Reaper.
That's why I train.
Rukia is not my concern.
I see... You're doing your best in your own way, huh?
I'll think it over carefully again.
It's certain that I'm undergoing changes...
I'm afraid, but I want to know what it is.
See you, Uryu.
Sorry Orihime...
But I can't let anyone see this training.
Please watch over me, Sensei...
I'm gonna die!
Precisely. Once the Chain of Fate is broken,
you can no longer return to your physical body.
Youll just die.
Quit talking like it doesn't matter!
Then, let me tell you something that does.
The chain will begin the Encroachment at the point of severance.
And when it reaches your chest,
you will become a Hollow... and it will be the end.
What?!
If you don't want to become a Hollow, you must become a Soul Reaper!
Huh?!
Once you clear Lesson Two,
you will regain the powers of a Soul Reaper!
Which you choose is your decision.
Okay! Then let's do it.
Go!
Are you shocked? By my ruse?
Hey hey...
It's awfully deep.
I did my best.
Owwee!
Wha-! What are these?!
Binding Spell 99
Restrict!
It was bold of me, but until this lesson is over,
your arms shall be sealed.
Dammit! Why you-!
Ichigo!
Climb back up here in that condition.
That is the lesson... otherwise called Shattered Shaft.
Idiot! As if I can do such a thing?!
I don't think you have time to wonder whether you can or not.
At the bottom of the Shattered Shaft, you have 72 hours, or three days,
before the chain is completely Encroached.
You must come back up here as a Soul Reaper before the time is up.
Otherwise, we'll have to kill you.
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I dont know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move
hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
Youre not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
Jinta! Ururu!
How quickly do you think Ichigo can come back as a Soul Reaper?
I say five hours!
About 12 hours...
Well, I'll wager a thousand points on him not returning...
Hold it, you!
