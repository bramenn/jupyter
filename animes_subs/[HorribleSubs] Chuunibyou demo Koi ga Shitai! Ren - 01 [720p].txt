My Mom and my sisters moved overseas because of Dad's job...
However, my first time living alone only lasted for a few days.
Hey, Rikka. I'm opening the door.
Wake up already. School starts today.
In a virtual repeat of last year's attempt...
I command you to awaken, Rikka Takanashi!
Or rather, Wicked Lord Shingan. The time of awakening has come!
Rikka, is sunny side up okay?
Dark side up, please.
Sunny side up it is.
Turn over!
So, which is it?
I gave her too many options.
Yuta!
Yes?
I can't find the ribbon for my school uniform.
Huh?
Gasp! Was it their doing?!
I let my guard down.
That's why I told you to get it ready yesterday.
I'm coming in.
There's no time for goofing around!
I'll yank out your antenna hair!
Please don't! It's my most attractive feature!
Rikka's mother also had to move out of town for work this spring...
Heave-ho...
Why are your things being moved out?
Have they finally made their move?!
What? Rikka's grandfather accidentally let go of their apartment?
It's sabotage!
I guess you'll have to live with me until your new place is sorted out.
Activating emergency code: Triple Four!
And so, Rikka temporarily came to live with me.
It's pleasant to be woken up by you.
Put yourself in my shoes.
That would never fly with the priestess.
I lied to Toka and told her I'd placed Rikka in a small apartment
and we are one week into our deceitful life.
Chimera, I give you my demonic fruit.
I am positive you are immune to red fruits.
This proves nothing!
Try one. They taste as good as strawberries.
That is impossible!
You're becoming more and more like the priestess.
Are you under her influence?!
I'm saying it for your own good.
Yuta!
The fluid! The green, squishy matter is attacking me!
Wait! Stay perfectly still.
Wiping at it will only make it worse.
You need to dab at it like this...
If you're heading out, please do take a collapsible umbrella with you.
You could say we're a couple.
We're a couple, but...
How do you get to romance from this kind of a starting point?
I've never even had a normal girlfriend before...
Things settled down in a way that isn't much different from before.
Guten morgen!
My name is Shinka Nibutani, and I'm in Year Two in high school starting today!
Nibutani?
Nibutani!
How do you do, everyone?
Let's make it another good year.
Sure.
What's wrong with her?
High school two syndrome?
I'm going to say this one more time.
Remember what you promised yesterday.
Of course.
Based on the hieroglyphs, the hateful magic barrier attack
triggered by the Freemasons...
Wrong!
Our uninvited guests the unfathomable parallel world?
Not that either.
Do you mean our discussion about performing the Schrodinger's
cat experiment using Chimera?
Never! Don't do it!
You know. How we're living together at my place.
Oh, yes. That.
That is the only thing I spoke to you about.
We should drop by the realty office again today.
If you are referring to my new base, it has already been located.
For real?
It is the demon world of the impossibly Wicked One,
invisible to mere mortals!
I thought you were being serious!
I'll yank out your antenna hair!
No, don't!
I see you lovebirds are already at it.
Who are you?
It's me, Isshiki. Makoto Isshiki!
Friend of yours?
Nope.
It's me! The guy in the Light Music Club!
The guy who sacrificed everything for upperclassman Kumi!
Oh, it's the crew cut guy.
Mister Crew Cut!
Stop calling me that! That version of me is dead!
Just look at my Rock'n'Roll hair!
Isshiki, what happened to your head?
Huh?
Let's go visit the student councilor.
You're getting it all wrong, Sensei.
My hair type changed when it grew back.
Whatever you say.
Hey, Kumin! Good morning!
I wonder who that was?
Kumin.
Rikka and Togashi. Morning.
You're both new Second Years today.
And now you're a Third Year.
Uh-huh. And it's such a let-down.
'Cause you'll have to study for university.
Uh-uh, that isn't what I mean. I'm disappointed.
Want to know why?
Why?
Because Year Three is sooo next year.
That's funny.
That's how it told me to deliver it.
Um, what have you got there?
You know how Morisummer always makes everybody laugh?
I want to be just like her.
Growing older brings many changes.
Morisummer!
Morning! What are you supposed to be?
How do you do, Kumin-senpai.
I am wearing regulation attire.
How do you do?
Are you experiencing advanced senility?
Senpai, if I might have a word...
Morisummer, where are we going?
DEKO DEKO MIDDLE MIDDLE
Death.
And so, let's all share another lively school year.
Thank you for that speech.
I'll show you.
I made a lot of mistakes...
I swear I will claw my way to the top of this school!
The next speech comes from our new students...
Wha-?!
I am the new student representative, Sanae Dekomori.
With the warm days of Spring...
They say that she got better grades than you had last year, Nibutani.
Our student lives also begin anew.
Oh, really?
That's amazing.
Deko!
Hey, what happened?
Ahem.
I believe everyone knows that in this world...
Wha-?
Seeing spirits requires the proper heart.
Love is everything.
Hey, are you feeling all right?
Sensei, Nibutani has fainted!
What are they doing?
We share the same class once again, Light Being.
What ever are you saying, Takanashi?
Are you okay?
Takanashi!
We're in the same class.
Let's have another good year.
Let's.
Miss Nanase is our home room teacher.
Togashi.
They told to get my hair cut for school tomorrow.
What'll I do?
How should I know? It's your own damned fault.
Wait, are we in the same class again?
No, I'm in Class 3 next door.
Thank God.
Is that relief?!
You made no attempt to hide your relief!
Togashi, a moment.
Who is this beautiful girl?
Pleased to meet you.
Are you Togashi's friend? My name is...
Pot, meet kettle.
I'm only bringing this up because we share a classroom.
I have clearly instructed Takanashi not to share...
Are you still on that?
I pondered all summer break.
I pondered my decision to attend this particular high school.
Do I really intend to spend three years of my life in that loser's club?
Hey, are you okay?
Servant to Wicked Lord Shingan!
User of the Mjolnir Hammer, Sanae Dekomori...
Only the deviously devious Fake Morisummer
would dare stage an attack on me in my temporary guise.
You are rotten to the core.
Now observe!
I spin right left, and left right.
The opposing revolutions shall produce a kink between dimensions and space!
And by adding an additional revolution, I shall produce unlimited power!
Take this! The Mjolnir...
You sure have weak semicircular canals.
Dekomori will not be defeated!
Rich Cheese (6 pcs)
Because you're such an energetic First Year...
love. So. Much.
Don't you think you're overdoing it?
One must deal with trouble of one's creation.
Paging a student.
Rikka Takanashi from Year 2, Class 4.
Please report to the staff room immediately. I repeat.
Rikka Takanashi from Year 2, Class 4,
please report to the staff room immediately.
The school has been overrun by terrorists!
Hardly.
Letters?
That's the thing. The school mailed at least three to your home.
They all came back returned to sender.
That may be due to the fact that my
existence had been erased from this world.
When we phone you, it says that number is not in use.
My existence had been erased.
But you exist right now, so perhaps it'll go through now.
You won't.
Why not?
My eye! My eye!
That's way too weak!
Far-East Magical Napping Society - Summer Thereof
She seemed to buy it, but we can't keep this up forever.
Don't say that.
But it's hard.
Can't you just try to take a bite?
Come over here and join us, Rikka.
No, thank you.
The incubus lives in that coffin.
Even one forged in the darkness such as I dare not approach.
I once experienced a frightening dream while under its influence.
Really? What did you dream about?
Ugh, the light! The Light Being is paralyzing me!
What're you doing?
Ow?
Why is ow in the form of a question?
No particular reason.
If you had to choose, where would you want to live?
Live?
What we were talking about before.
Regarding your new base and battle formation.
The base where my Wicked Lord
Shingan and the Dark Flame Master manifest...
You know it that's out.
I know.
Nibutani.
Hey, what's with the costume?
Is that idiot here?
Look what she did to my costume for Theatre Club!
FAKE
She's sleeping inside.
Sleeping?
How convenient.
PERMANENT MARKER
Later!
Later.
What, you're leaving?
Something like that.
We must search for a new base.
Zip it. C'mon.
Base?
For all that...
I have no idea where you should set up house alone.
I favor a subterranean labyrinth, but a medieval castle will do.
Get real.
Past the corner store, there's a castle building that says Parliament on it.
You idiot! Stay away from that place!
Yuta.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize how expensive rent is...
I mean, I knew it might be expensive.
Actually, I don't know much about it either.
It has to be expensive.
Yuta.
Will I be barred from this place once I have transferred to my new base?
Don't be silly.
But I won't come here when I commute to and from school.
Well, yeah, probably not.
I won't be able to go to your room to report activity in the magical realm.
What a shame.
But...
I'll drop by to pick you up for school.
We need to find you a place nearby so I can visit.
Don't you want to stay together?
You two!
Nibutani.
Takanashi's apartment is vacant. What's going on?
Did you move, Rikka?
Well, actually...
Let's have an explanation.
Toka?!
We leave for Italy soon...
What's the story?
Uh, it's not what you think!
Yuta! Run for it!
You dummy!
I see. You are attempting to maintain secrecy.
Master!
Schwing!
Dekomori!
I was right to tail Fake Summer!
I, your loyal servant, will buy you the time you need!
Masters, please evacuate to safety!
Do you realize who you're up against?
Natch!
She is the priestess who, in a previous batle...
I couldn't wish for a worthier opponent.
Now, come at me!
Hey, you! Your hand! Your hand!
DUMMY
I know your intent now.
No! You're wrong! This isn't what it looks like!
This is Fake Morisummer's doing!
Hey! It your fault to begin with.
I deeply respect you, Priestess!
As my master's sister, I am at your command!
Stop trying to throw me under the bus!
You two are such good friends.
I'm sorry. My hand slipped.
What?!
All hands, prepare for combat!
Assume positions and prepare to intercept!
Be destroyed, real.
Blow up, synapses!
Vanishment This World!
Dark Matter Blaze.
It's no good.
She easily deflected your Dark Matter Blaze.
She's unbelievable.
It's all or nothing!
Yay!
How about a physical attack?
Direct Impact!
Machine Gun!
(DEMON GOD GUN) MA SHIN GAN
Machine Gun!
Yuta!
Schwarz Shield!
Arrostire!
What's arrostire?
It means oven roasted.
Yuta!
Too hot!
You shacked up?!
Really?
Like I said, it's not what you think.
In what way?
You're living together as boyfriend and girlfriend.
Please control your disgusting imagination.
What do you mean, disgusting?
I think you're the one with the dirty mind.
W-what? I, Dekomori, am always pure of thought!
You've gone beet red.
For a little kid, you have a really dirty mind.
Be quiet! Be quiet, you big-boobed freak!
Hey, stop that!
Shacking is sooo shocking!
That hurt.
Anyway, it's really not what you think...
You're saying that a full grown boy like yourself had no choice...
you are in a romantic relationship?
That's not what I meant.
You are not in a romantic relationship?
Uh, no...
You guys split up?
You dissolved your pact?
Who dumped whom?
Quit it! I'm saying we are not shacking up!
How is that different?
Yes, we are living together...
concerned about leaving Rikka on her own.
It's been almost a week now, and nothing of the sort is going on.
Of what sort?
Beat it, all of you!
How about it?
Our contract remains unaltered.
In other words, we're not living together...
It's a home share situation. You know!
Ow!
Do you think that logic will fly by me?
Do you think I will permit that?
You are a boy!
My magazine!
No matter what, you cannot live together.
I will find her an apartment. If you have a problem with that...
Italy?
The magical society! The Cardinal!
Am I to be imprisoned in such a place?
Italy is home to the occult!
The Vatican, Sixth Sense, I see dead people!
Home to the occult?
So, you want to go now?
Yes?
I'm home.
Good evening.
Kuzuha, why are you here?
I came home.
Surely you were told I was coming back for the new school term.
I was told? By who?
By Mom.
Oops, I forgot!
Rikka has been living here?
What's so bad about that?
Huh?
After all, she doesn't have her own place, right?
We have plenty of rooms here.
You're really sure?
To be honest, I was also concerned about leaving Rikka on her own.
If you would act as supervisor, it should be okay.
I'm sorry. Please let her stay here just a little longer.
Sure.
Understood. You can count on me.
Hurry up and find your own place.
And so, my life alone with Rikka came to an abrupt end...
TOGASHI MAIL FOR NAKANISHI HERE
Yuta's notebook. I forgot to return it to him.
Rikka?
Not again.
What the-?
Did someone new move in?
She never was able to get her apartment back.
To Be Continued
