Hey all you viewers out there!
When you're watching Fairy Tail keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen, all right?
Previously on Fairy Tail...
What the heck is that?
We discovered a monster frozen in ice, Deliora, on Galuna Island.
Gray's teacher, Ul, traded her life in order to seal it away,
but Lyon, Ul's more elder student, is plotting to resurrect Deliora!
What's the matter? That all you got?
Wake up, Gray!
Wake up, Gray...
Wake up, Gray!
How lame... You got butt-whupped good.
Natsu... Why are you here?
I didn't know which direction the village was, so I climbed back up to a high spot.
Over there! Let's head out.
Wait! I can walk...
Where's Lyon?
Dunno. No one's here.
The ceremony's over, too.
Crap! If Lucy's in trouble, it's our fault!
Stop! You'll never be able to defeat something like Deliora. It's impossible for you, Gray!
I'm gonna do an S class quest!
They're called S class for a reason!'Cause they're outta your league!
Natsu...
Huh?
I have no right to say anything to you.
No right at all!
You gonna sit there mopin' all day'cause you lost, Gray?!
We're Fairy Tail, damn it!
The guild that doesn't know the meaning of the word stop!
We only know how to keep running forward!
Goddammit! It's really hard to run like this!
Natsu vs. Yuka The Wave!
So there you have it.
The people who are coming to attack are to blame for doing this to your bodies.
They're coming here?
Yes. But on the bright side, this is your chance to capture them!
Can we really pull that off?
Will it work?
Seriously?
Those three are probably wizards, so they won't be captured so easily.
True. We have the advantage when it comes to numbers, but no wizards.
What? You're not planning on fighting, Lucy?
I just thought of the perfect plan!
I have a bad feeling about this.
What's the meaning of all the ruckus?
Village Chief!
Please listen! Enemies will be attacking this village soon.
Enemies?
They've been staying at the ruins in the forest,
and they're the ones who turned your bodies into demons!
Who cares?!
Haven't you destroyed the moon yet?!
Well, there's no need to destroy the moon...
If we just catch the ones responsible...
The moon! Destroy the moon!
Chief, please calm down!
Come now, this way.
Don't mind him.
It's because of what happened to his son, Bobo...
Yeah.
Anyway, we're going to capture them.
But, how?
Just leave this to the great Lucy! Fairy Tail's number-one Celestial Wizard!
This is going to work like a charm, just watch!
I'm so awesome!
She's really gotten into this.
Gate of the Maiden, I open thee!
Virgo!
Did you call for me, Princess?
Cute!
So this is a maid?
I can't get enough!
Guess they don't get many maids around here...
And so...
Princess, preparations are complete.
Thanks, Virgo. You're always so fast.
You wish to punish me?
That was a compliment!
Um, well...
What is it, Happy?
I really think you might actually be an idiot, Lucy.
Whatever happened to if you can't say nice things?
I can't imagine that they'd fall for such a childish trick.
What're you talking about? This pitfall is perfect!
Yeah, see... That's exactly why you're an idiot.
There's only one entrance to this village, right?
Which means that the enemy is sure to come in that way.
I don't think there's a single person who would fall for that.
M-Me either.
Actually, neither would I.
Princess, I concur as well!
Even you?!
Just watch, all of you!
Ms. Lucy, someone is coming!
They're here already? Open the gate!
Right!
Now, come to mama.
Everyone, you okay?
Natsu!
Stop! Don't come any closer!
What?
I said stop! Stop!
Whoa there.
What's this?
There was someone who actually fell for it.
Didn't expect that.
Failure!
Hey, hey, hey! Who the hell put a hole here?
Lucy, obviously.
I knew it!
You've got it all wrong!
I'm glad you and Gray are safe though!
There's nothing to be glad about! Gray's outta commission!
He got beat by the masked guy?
The ice came off!
Even though fire didn't work?
R-Right, just like I planned!
Perhaps the magic had weakened due to the distance between the caster and the victim.
All right!
Gray...
Great, but... They still haven't shown up yet?
True, they're taking their time.
Even though they left for the village before you did,
and yet you got here first, Natsu.
Yeah. And it really took me a while too.
Now's our chance! Cover the hole back up, hurry!
You're still goin' for the pitfall plan?
What's that?
There's a flying rat!
What's that bucket?
From the sky?! My pitfall's pointless!
Preparing the nuke'em jelly took quite a while.
But this'll be perfect.
Those damn wizards have all gathered in the village.
Our wishes cannot be fulfilled until Deliora is completely destroyed.
Only death awaits those who would stand in our way.
Jelly?
Lucy!
What the heck is that dangerous smell?
The bucket is filled with that?!
They're gonna pour it everywhere!
Hideous.
The Moon Drip turns humans into these hideous things?
They're almost like Deliora's demon-spawn... How unpleasant.
Angelica, if you'll do the honor.
How are we supposed to defend against this?
Everyone gather into the village center!
Natsu!
Happy, let's fly!
Aye, sir!
Chief, I understand how you feel, but...
With a flaming right hand and a flaming left hand...
When you combine the flames together...
I'll blow it away!
Dazzling Blaze of the Fire Dragon!
He blasted it outward!
He's a fire wizard!
Chief!
The village chief presented for punishment.
Virgo!
The village is totally dissolved.
How awful...
Is anybody hurt?
Bobo's grave...
We must eliminate all of Reitei-sama's enemies.
Even after we tried to mercifully give them an instant death.
It seems a lot of blood must be spilled.
Huh?
50 people in the village. 2 wizards. That should take 15 minutes.
Let's go!
Yeah!
I'm going too! 3 wizards!
How dare they... How dare they destroy Bobo's grave!
Unforgivable!
You can't, Chief!
We should all escape from here!
We'll get caught up in a fight between wizards!
No!
Someone take the Chief!
I can fight too.
Gray, you regained consciousness?
Get outta here. You'll be in my way.
Natsu, don't underestimate me!
The injured should sleep it off.
You bastard...
One day I'll...
Why'd he do that?
That's just Natsu's compassion.
Gray's not in any shape to fight now.
So that's the bond between Fairy Tail wizards...
Take care of Gray, okay?
Leave him to us.
Okay, let's go!
We won't let you escape.
Reitei-sama has ordered us to wipe you all out.
Angelica!
I'm a member of Fairy Tail too...
I got all gung-ho and grabbed on!
Yup, she's an idiot!
She's nuts!
Stop this instant! Don't lay a claw on the villagers!
Who does she think she is?
How about this?
That's not going to work, you know.
Angelica?
What are you doing? If you stop your tail...
It worked!
I'm falling too!
Someone's gonna be ticked...
I'm not ticked!
Not you, idiot.
She okay, you think?
Hope she's not crushed.
She'd be dead if she was crushed.
I'll go take a look.
Right. Countin' on ya.
I'll clean things up here.
Those are some ferocious flames you have there.
Could you be Fairy Tail's Salamander that I've heard rumors about?
We were once wizards from a well known guild.
You won't beat us so easily.
If I mention the wizard's guild Lamia Scale, does that ring a bell?
Exactly, that's where Hard Iron Jera was...
Hey, jerk! Listen to people while they're talking!
Never heard of'em.
It don't matter what guild you're from or who you know.
You're gettin' in the way of me completing this job.
In other words, you're the enemy of Fairy Tail.
That's all the reason I need to fight.
Toby, hold off. I can handle this guy myself.
Wave!
I'll blow that away!
Ah, so you've noticed what it was.
Wave!
The vibrations I create can neutralize any type of magic!
In other words...
Magic that is impregnable to magic!
So that's why my instincts said I couldn't block that attack with fire.
While I was in Lamia Scale, I specialized in facing off against other wizards.
I think you can see why.
It's because all wizards are powerless before me!
We'll see about that!
Wave!
I thought I told you that my wave will erase all magic before it.
Then I just need do it without magic!
That ain't nothing hard!
See? Right on through.
It's reckless of you to stick your bare arm into the vortex of magical power.
It'll get blown away.
He's gonna put his whole body in?!
This wall might not let magic in, but bare hands are no problem!
This guy's nuts!
And what will you do now, Salamander?
You can't use magic inside the wave...
So I can use it outside, right?
Thanks for the advice!
Elbow of...
You're using a magic booster to accelerate your bare hands?!
That's one down.
You're awesome.
You're about to get some awesome all to yourself.
Yeah, right! I'm stronger than Yuka, see!
Paralyze-Claw: Mega-Jellyfish!
These claws have got a secret hidden within them!
Like, they'll paralyze you?
How did he know?
You're one amazing wizard!
What am I gonna do? He's a complete idiot.
Don't call me an idiot!
Whoa there.
One touch from these claws, and it's all over!
You'll be shaking like a leaf waiting only for death!
Wait, just a second!
You got something stuck on you up here.
Ooh, that felt kind of good...
Yeah, definitely an idiot.
Those guys really did some pretty terrible stuff.
But I'm gonna make sure the village and everyone goes back to the way they were.
Bet on it!
I'm gonna get you justice.
Reitei-sama, why didn't you finish off that troublemaker named Gray?
It doesn't matter. You know I have no taste for bloodshed.
You say that despite ordering the village completely wiped out.
But it seems to me you had sympathy for your fellow pupil.
He won't stand against me after being defeated so easily.
And if he does get in my way, then I'll allow no quarter.
Really...?
Oh? It's her...
How dare you, young lady?!
Now Reitei-sama's trust in me will have fallen like a rock!
He'll never love me!
Love?
And you even did this to Angelica...
I'll get you for this!
Fine by me! Bring it on!
Wood Doll!
The tree is moving!
Gate of the Golden Bull, I open thee!
Taurus!
I'm not a perv! Just true to my desires!
A Celestial Wizard! And one of the Zodiac gates, too!
Nice, Taurus!
Lucy-san, your body's the best!
Forcing your spirits to say things like that for your pleasure?
How uncouth.
I'm not forcing him, and I'm not pleased by it!
However, Celestial Wizards are at such a disadvantage against me.
Taurus, do it!
Hey, Taurus! What's the matter?
Rampage!
Hey, wait!
Lucy-san, I can't control my body!
My magic, Doll Attack, allows me to control anything other than humans.
That goes for Celestial Spirits, since they are not human.
Oh, no!
I'm udderly ashamed, Lucy-san!
No matter how much I will it, my body won't...
Gate of the Golden Bull, I command thee to close!
Doesn't the spirit and wizard have to open and close the gate together?
Close the gate, Taurus!
You can't close it unilaterally.
Taurus!
Let's play Russian Roulette Punch, shall we?
Close your eyes and punch!
I wonder how long you'll be able to dodge?
Taurus, stop it!
I want to stop, but...
So this is a Fairy Tail wizard? Nothing of substance.
Please! Remember your contract with me, Taurus!
So you're called Lucy, huh? But man, what a body you've got!
I can't get enough!
I can't believe the Spirit of the Gate of the Golden Bull is such a perv.
What should I do about the contract?
There's no reason to hesitate!
If you contract with me, I'll make sure to protect you and that nice body of yours!
You promise?
I promise!
You told me that'd you'd always protect me, remember?
Hey, what're you hesitating for? Do what I say and get her!
Celestial Gates should be opened and closed by mutual agreement!
Come to your senses, Taurus!
I did it...
I can't believe there was a Celestial Wizard who could do that. I miscalculated.
I've reached a new level!
That's right! Because I'm a member of Fairy Tail, got it?
Professor Happy's Fairy Tail Lecture!
Today we'll be telling you the secrets of Lucy, a Celestial Spirit Wizard!
Lucy uses magical keys to summon various Celestial Spirits!
But she's most fun when her looks misfire,
or goes overboard in her complaints.
Until next time!
Stand, Bow, Aye!
Natsu, we've got trouble! Erza's arrived!
Say what? We're in deep...
She is seriously angry this time.
Okay. Then before Erza finds us,
we beat up the masked guy. I put my hands together and blow away Deliora. And we get the heck off this island.
But that ice won't melt from fire.
Next time: Do What You Must!!
What if we let them melt it and then blow it away?
I think you're missing the big picture, but we'd have to wait for nightfall for that.
What should we do?
