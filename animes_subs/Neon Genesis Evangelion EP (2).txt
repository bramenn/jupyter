Are you ready, Shinji?
Yes.
Release the final safety lock!
Release the final safety lock!
Evangelion Unit 01, lift off!
Shinji, just concentrate on walking right now.
Walk...
It walked!
Walk...
Shinji, are you okay?
Hurry! Get up!
Shinji, calm down! That's not your arm!
What's going on with the Eva's defense system?
The signal's not working!
The field's not unfolding!
Have we failed?
Left arm damaged!
The circuits have snapped!
The circuits have snapped!
Shinji, dodge!
There's a crack on the front of the brain case!
The armor won't last much longer!
The head's been damaged! Extent of damage, unknown!
The control nerves are breaking off!
We're not getting any readings on the pilot!
Shinji!
This ceiling is unfamiliar.
So, the Angels have returned?
It's so sudden.
It's the same as it was fifteen years ago.
A disaster comes as it will, without warning.
On the positive side, our previous investments will not go to waste.
You can't be sure about that yet.
If it doesn't pay off, it's a waste all the same.
Correct. Now that the Angels have become common knowledge,
we have to manipulate the information to avoid trouble.
NERV must take care of these matters quickly.
It's already been taken care of. You may rest assure of that.
In regards to the declaration of the state of emergency,
government officials have announced...
This incident was...
UN forces in Japan...
Public scenario B-22, as we thought. UN forces in Japan...
So, we're hushing up the truth again? No, there's no threat of contamination from the center of the explosion.
But at least our Public Relation people are thrilled. No, there's no threat of contamination from the center of the explosion.
But at least our Public Relation people are thrilled. The only Angel samples collected were adhered to the Eva.
Now that they've finally got something to do. The only Angel samples collected were adhered to the Eva.
We're being pretty casual about it. The only Angel samples collected were adhered to the Eva.
We're being pretty casual about it. Correct, as in the model simulation, approximately 99.9 of it evaporated.
I don't think so. I think we're all scared to death. Correct, as in the model simulation, approximately 99.9 of it evaporated.
Correct, as in the model simulation, approximately 99.9 of it evaporated.
Of course we are.
Well, we must acknowledge that.
Speaking of which, Mr. Ikari,
isn't there a better way to utilize NERV and Eva?
We're referring to the repair costs for Unit 01,
which when added to the costs for Unit 00,
are enough to bankrupt an entire country.
We also understand that you gave that particular toy to your son, didn't you?
Manpower, time and money.
How much more will be wasted by you and your family?
And that is not your only responsibility.
The Human Enhancement Project,
that should be your top priority.
Yes, in these desperate circumstances that project is our only hope.
Do you understand?
In any case, the Angel is no excuse for delaying that project's schedule.
However, we will consider adjusting the budget.
Now, the rest of this meeting concerns only us.
Your presence here was appreciated, Mr. Ikari.
Ikari, you do understand there can be no turning back, don't you?
I know.
Mankind has no time left.
Air conditioning has just got to be mankind's greatest treasure.
It's the triumph of science over nature.
Shinji's woken up.
How is he?
No external injuries. His memory is a bit muddled, however.
You don't think it could be brain damage?
The doctor said that there was nothing to worry about.
Really?
I suppose he did have a pretty hectic day.
His cranial nerves must have taken a lot of strain.
Don't you mean his heart?
Okay, go on.
Yeah, that way. Stop.
If Eva and this city both operate at their full potential,
maybe we can make it through this.
Are you going to defeat the Angels? You're always such an optimist.
Sometimes you need a little wishful thinking just to keep on living.
I see your point. Your attitude makes me feel a little more at ease.
See ya!
Dr. Ugai of Internal Department One, Dr. Ugai,
Dr. Ugai of Internal Department One, Dr. Ugai,
please call Dr. Azuma of the First Surgical Department immediately.
The medical conference on the B Experiment will be held as scheduled.
All supervisors please proceed to conference room two.
Are you sure?
They don't want to live together?
I think that living apart is natural for Ikari and his son.
And being together is unnatural?
Alone?
Right. His room will be in the Sixth Block, just beyond this one.
Is that satisfactory?
Is that satisfactory?
Yes.
Are you sure? Shinji...
It's fine. Being alone is okay with me.
I'm alone anyway.
What?!
So, I said, I'll take care of Shinji.
So, I said, I'll take care of Shinji.
I've already got permission from the brass.
Hey, it's not like I'm going to put the moves on him.
Of course you're not! How could you even think of such a thing?
You're always like that. Shame on you!
She just can't take a joke. You're always like that. Shame on you!
Well, we'll have to have a party tonight, right?
What for?
What for? A welcoming party for my new roommate, of course!
What for? A welcoming party for my new roommate, of course!
So, you're going to move after all?
Yes. I'd never have dreamt that this city would become a battlefield.
Yeah.
My husband's saying that our kid and I should move, at the very least.
Don't I know it.
This city may be a fortress, but that's no guarantee of safety.
Just remembering it gives me the chills.
Really.
I hope you don't mind if we make a little stop on the way.
Where?
Someplace really cool.
So desolate. This city seems so lonely.
It's time.
Amazing! The buildings are growing!
This city is a fortress, designed to protect against the Angels.
This is Tokyo 3.
This is our city.
And it's the city that you saved.
NEON GENESIS EVANGELION
Your things should have already been delivered, Shinji.
I just moved into this apartment too.
Come on in.
Pardon the intrusion.
Shinji, this is your home now.
I'm home.
As you can see, the place is a little bit messy.
Make yourself comfortable.
You call this
a little bit messy?
Oh! Sorry! Could you put the food in the fridge?
Sure.
Ice,
snacks
and tons of beer.
What kind of a life does she lead?
Excuse me. What's in the other fridge?
Oh, don't mind that. He's probably still sleeping!
Sleeping?
Let's eat!
Let's eat.
Life just doesn't get any better than this!
Don't you want to eat? It's good, even if it is all instant.
I'm sorry, I'm just not used to it.
That's no excuse! You can't be so finicky.
No, that's not what I... well...
Isn't this nice?
Having two for dinner instead of eating alone!
Yeah...
Here we go for the next one.
Paper, stone and scissors...
Pon! Pon! Pon! Pon!
Sorry, Shinji.
Okay! That was a pretty fair way of splitting our daily chores, right?
Yeah.
This is your home now, so make yourself comfortable,
This is your home now, so make yourself comfortable,
and take advantage of everything here, except me.
Yes.
Man, yes, yes, yes. Is that all you say? It's getting on my nerves.
Man, yes, yes, yes. Is that all you say? It's getting on my nerves.
You're a boy, aren't you? Act like a man! Okay?
Yes.
Okay, that's just the way you are.
Well, why don't you go take a bath and scrub away those bad memories.
Bathing cleanses both the mind and soul.
Miss Misato!
What?
What?
A p... p... p...
What?
Oh, him? He's one of those new warm water penguins.
What was that?
His name is Pen-pen. He's your other roommate.
His name is Pen-pen. He's your other roommate.
Why don't you cover that up?
I guess I'm not being as nice as I ought to.
Of course, he's probably already made up his mind about me.
Misato Katsuragi.
She's not a bad person.
Bathing cleanses both the mind and soul.
But bad memories always seem to find me when I'm in the bath.
Like my father
and Rei Ayanami.
So, how was Rei today?
You did see her at the hospital this afternoon, didn't you?
She'll be ready to work again in twenty days.
By then, we'll be ready to re-activate Unit 00 from cryo-stasis.
It's so hard on these poor children.
There is no one else who can pilot the Evas.
As long as they survive, that is what I'll have them do.
With no regard to what they may want?
Yeah, after all the horrible stuff he went through,
I doubt that he'll pilot it again.
Maintaining him is part of your job, Misato.
I'm just scared. I don't know how to deal with him.
Grumbling already? It was your idea to take him in, you know.
Shut up!
I was just thinking of Shinji as a tool.
I'm as shameless as Ritsuko.
We destroyed the Angel.
So, why can't I be happy about it?
Another unfamiliar ceiling.
Of course. In this whole city, there's no place that's familiar.
This is your home.
Why am I here?
The brain case has been damaged! Extent of damage unknown!
We're having problems maintaining activation!
Status report!
The synchrograph is reversing! The pulses are flowing backward!
The synchrograph is reversing! The pulses are flowing backward!
Break the circuit! Block it!
We can't! It's not accepting the signal! It won't take it!
What about Shinji?
His monitors aren't responding. His condition's unknown!
His monitors aren't responding. His condition's unknown!
Unit 01's gone completely silent!
Misato!
We've got to stop this.
Abort the operation! Rescuing the pilot is our first priority!
Eject the entry plug!
We can't! It's completely out of control!
No way!
The Eva's re-activating!
Impossible! How could this happen?!
Impossible! How could this happen?!
Impossible!
A berserker?!
A berserker?!
It looks like we've won.
An AT field!
No! As long as the Angel has that AT field up...
He can't get near the Angel!
The left arm has been regenerated!
The left arm has been regenerated!
Incredible!
Unit 01's expanding an AT field of its own!
It's neutralizing the phase space!
No, not neutralizing, it's eroding it!
Unbelievable! It went through that AT field so easily.
No! It's going to self-destruct!
Is the Eva...
That must be the Eva's
true form.
Circuits reconnected.
Systems restored. Graphs back to normal.
Pilot life signs, confirmed.
Send out the recovery team. Hurry!
Preserving the pilot's life is our first priority.
Shinji, can I come in?
I forgot to tell you something.
You did a very good thing today.
You should be proud of yourself.
Good night, Shinji.
Hang in there.
TO BE CONTINUED

Shinji starts a new life with the training of Eva, school, and a roommate.
Next time: A Phone That Never Rings. And of course, I'll give you good service!
