Ouma Shu has obtained the Void Genome and recovered his powers.
He has also materialized his own Void.
I know.
You know? You dont mean
How are things, Mana?
Its cramped in here.
This girls pretty stubborn for a fake.
But soon, all of this will be me.
Then we can have lots of fun together
Triton.
The reality of the destruction around us fills our mind
The raging rain sounds like a storm of tears
that your eyes were given to you to acknowledge others,
that your eyes were given to you to acknowledge others,
that your eyes were given to you to acknowledge others,
that your eyes were given to you to acknowledge others,
that your eyes were given to you to acknowledge others,
that your voice was given to you to tell others how you feel
All living things
bear witness to my song
Your heart contains all its truth
Even when all you see in your path are storms
remember that your strength is no coincidence
Here you are, Yahiro.
Shu was pretty amazing, wasn't he?
Arent you going to say anything to him?
What should I say?
Theres a message from Ward 24.
Gais talking! Hurry!
I warned you once.
Dont get in my way.
Yet, there have been 34 invasion attempts
and 42,000 hacking attempts on Ward 24.
Therefore, I have come to a conclusion.
You want to die.
You want to be destroyed.
Very well. I shall grant your wish.
Ive decided to let this world determine each of your individual worths.
On December 25th, the current world shall end
and a new world shall begin.
Mr. Kuhouin instructed me to use all his assets and connections to fight Gai.
To do that, well join forces with a PMC tomorrow morning.
That is, a private military company.
Ouma Shu,
would you fight with us?
Ill ask the rest of you as well.
Please lend us your help!
Would someone tell me something first?
Whats Gai trying to do exactly?
The Fourth Apocalypse.
Gai intends to cause Lost Christmas on a worldwide scale.
Shibungi! No way, are you a ghost?!
Im quite alive.
Shu. Gai gave me this.
Thats
Dr. Ouma Kurosus diary.
Dads?
They have the right to die knowing everything
and the obligation as well.
Especially Shu.
As Ouma Kurosus former best friend, isnt that what you want, Dad?
”Best friend” There was a time when I could call him that.
That was back when I was still a graduate student at Tennozu College.
At the time, other people were nothing but annoyances to me.
However
Keido! This paper of yours is just too beautiful!
I cant stop crying, Im so moved!
I found out something when Ouma Kurosu appeared.
There were others who could operate from the same conceptual framework as me,
argue theory with me,
and compete with me.
And then the Genomic Resonance Theory Kurosu constructed
on the basis of my Intron RAM Hypothesis
commanded worldwide attention as the key to unlocking the mysteries
of evolution and natural selection.
Kurosu, look! Your paper is
Saeko Shijou.
A woman from the colleges medical school who was famous across campus for her accomplishments.
She was already carrying Kurosus child by then.
Before long, they were married
and moved to Oshima, where her family lived.
Five years later
Check this out, Shuuichirou!
Amino acid bonding?!
And this is a Genomic Resonance reaction!
It was Mana who found the meteorite.
Well have to thank her.
I knew it. This is a virus.
Generally its not very infectious.
Yet, when its activated by Genomic Resonance
It inserts itself into introns and starts replicating,
causing structural sclerosis.
Then this is
An instrument for playing the notes of Genomic Resonance.
Its a trumpet for the Apocalypse.
Her growth is coming along nicely, isnt it?
Who are you?
Im Yu. Im an envoy of Daath.
Daath”?
The meteorite has sown the seeds of Apocalypse across the nation.
Very soon, all the people of your country will become their seedbed.
When Mana eventually matures as Eve,
the Earth will witness its fourth Apocalypse
The simultaneous selection and evolution of all life.
You see, Apocalypse is the invisible hand of God” at work.
Kurosu, I believe your wife is symptomatic already,
but you mustnt kill her unborn child.
Eve appears intent on making him her Adam.
And so, Ouma Shu was born.
At the cost of his mothers life.
The Adam that Eve desired
Unless something was done,
both of Kurosus children would be responsible for our future.
His blood would set the standard of the next generation.
When I thought of that, something inside me cracked.
Kurosu turned me down
But what will you do, Shuuichirou?
Lets hear what you have to say.
Illegal immigration?
Or perhaps they were kidnapped and intended to be sold.
He was the only one alive.
So, youre awake.
Im the man
who will be your father.
The place Keido brought me to was a facility
where he was rearing many male children,
trying to create Adam,
a mate for Mana.
You could call it a nursery.
Experiment after experiment.
We were administered artificially strengthened Apocalypse.
And then I
”Triton.”
You came from sea, so youre Triton.
Isnt that a great name?
Ironic, isnt it?
Trying to escape one fate that day,
I wound up trapped in an even bigger fate.
Isnt that right, Shu?
Its been a long time, hasnt it?
Im sorry, I didnt notice you
Are you one of the student researchers? Its nice to meet you.
Ive gotten you blankets before,
when Ive found you asleep.
Im Keido Shuuichirous little sister, Haruka.
How rude of me!
Haruka
Typesetting in my GC?
It's more likely than you think.
Haruka
Haruka
Haruka
Haruka
I had just skipped a grade and started college.
As a smart aleck who lived too much in her head,
Kurosu triggered my curiosity.
He left his children behind in Oshima
to immerse himself in his research, forgetting to eat and sleep.
To me, he looked like a martyr fighting the virus in solitude.
Shus little sister
Haruka
Thanks for all that you do
Shus little sister
Haruka
Thanks for all that you do
Im going to marry Kurosu.
Kurosu? You?
Hes a really lonely person.
You can tell, cant you?
Because youre his one and only rival.
Do as you like.
Well, now you know.
Has the apocalypse research made a little progress?
More than it has at your place, anyway.
He told me so.
That year, I become Kurosus wife.
And I called Shu and the others over from Oshima,
and the first Christmas we tried to spend as a family
It was that fateful day.
December 24th, 2029.
Papas late.
Wheres Shu?
The bathroom, Miss Haruka.
Shu and I will be fine here.
You go pick up Papa, okay?
I bet he got caught up in his research and forgot about meeting us again.
You dont mind, then?
Not at all.
The Apocalypse Virus exteriorizes and materializes the hearts of the infected.
But Ive found a genetic code that may be able to interfere with that process.
Ive named it the Void Genome”.
The unreasonableness of the seeds selection
was restored to reason with the Void Genome,
by exteriorizing the obscure thing we call the heart”.
Apocalypse is not divine providence.
We can control it with human intelligence.
Peeking into the diaries of other people isnt a nice hobby, Shuuichirou.
Kurosu
Have you actually solved it all?
By yourself?
The mysteries of evolution and natural selection?
Im surprised.
But Daath is losing its patience.
Youll be silenced if you dont do something.
Ill negotiate with them for you.
Lets work together on this, Kurosu.
No need.
I know other places do things as a team, but I personally cant.
Doing it as a team would only dilute my thinking.
Dont treat me like a fool!
Whats wrong?
Im wasting my time letting too many cooks spoil the soup, is that what youre saying?
No, thats not it.
I cant drag my friend into the jam Im in, can I?
Dont lie to me!
You were jealous of my position,
so you tried to get back at me by getting results
while using deliberately inferior equipment!
Wh-What are you talking about?!
What would I be jealous of you for?!
I give up.
I admit it, Kurosu.
Youre a genius.
But youve made one big mistake.
Youre no friend of mine.
Kurosu!
No!
I was right.
Your Void can temporarily house the Voids of others.
At the same time, it can isolate and absorb cancer cells,
as well as the Apocalypse Virus genetic material itself.
Thats good. Souta must be cured, then.
Please, Shu!
Dont use that power anymore!
No matter how hard you try to get Inori back,
it might be too late.
The transplanting of Manas consciousness into Inori
had already finished!
But to make her complete,
all the factors of hers that scatted during Lost Christmas
The shards of her that had mixed with peoples Voids
had to be collected.
Thats what you were being forced to do over the past few months.
At this point,
shes regained most of her power.
Thats why Gais been setting deadlines.
Thats just another reason why I have to go.
Right?
Shu
The helicopters are about to take off.
I trust youll come with us, Shu?
Connect those cables!
The APUs are hooked up!
Fuel! Hey, where are the filters?!
Container coming through!
Its almost time.
Hey.
Are you really okay leaving things like this, Souta?
O-Ouma!
Is this everybody?
Im giving you back your Voids.
Shu?!
Wait! If you do that, your power will
But I have to give them back.
If I die while Im still borrowing them,
everyone else will die too.
Its okay.
Ill take on the cancer and the virus.
You come here too, Ayase.
Shu
Screw that!
Yesterday, you didnt have any objections about taking them,
and now youre giving them back?!
How are you going to fight, then?!
My arms not too weak to fire a gun with.
Thats crazy!
Do you think you can win against Gai like that, Shu?!
Im going to use this power to save Inori and everyone else.
Its not to defeat Gai with.
Is there something wrong with that?!
I want you to keep my Void.
If you fail, our lives are forfeit anyway.
Thats the gist of it.
Were fine with that, but
What do you think, Souta?
Its fine.
I gave it to you.
Not that I really get it
But its okay.
What the hell?! Cut it out!
Im not trying to give your Void back.
Lets shake hands, Souta.
We have to shake hands to make up, right?
You said so yourself!
We cant part ways like this.
Thats what I think.
Your hand
Im sorry, Shu
Its not your fault.
I was so scared of you
I hated being like that!
I felt the same way.
Please, Shu
Stay my friend
Stay like this!
Were friends, Souta.
Well be friends for life.
Kurosu was the kind of person who could do anything by himself.
Anything.
And he was always alone because of it.
But the truth was, he was really lonely
He wanted to be with everyone else
Thats why he named you Shu”, which stands for group”.
