Manaka-san...
There you go, making that depressing face again.
You don't have to worry so much.
But...
I'm saying...
She'll wake up soon just like Kaname and I did.
There's no doubt.
Right...
It's been one week since Manaka-san came back.
Come on, let's go.
Everyone believed somewhere in their hearts...
Yeah.
What the hell is with English being first period?
That she'd be the same as Hikari or Kaname-san.
That she'd wake up soon.
But...
Manaka-san still showed no signs of waking up.
Episode Twenty: Sleeping Beauty
That ends our lesson for today.
Those who finish cleaning first can go home.
I know it's a lot of homework, but don't forget it.
All right!
What?
Let's get the bathroom cleaning over with!
Seriously?
Today's the day I'm gonna catch that Uroko!
Uroko-sama may know a way to wake Manaka up.
Yeah, considering he's the one who made everyone hibernate.
Kaname, hurry up!
Oh, sorry about that.
What're you doing?
I'm gonna leave you behind.
I thought that Hikari would be more panicked about Manaka-san,
but he seems pretty positive.
Is Manaka-san at your house by herself during the day?
My mom's been getting days off from Saya Mart to take care of her.
I see.
Damn it.
Where the hell is he hiding?
The water temperature's getting lower.
You think so?
I think it's a lot lower since the day we found Manaka in Shishio.
Could it be that the Sea God is angry?
About us taking Manaka back?
It's not a big deal.
All we have to do is come up to the surface
once in a while and warm up.
Hey, Hikari!
You haven't rested since you came back up...
See? It's no problem at all.
Yeah, but...
Yep. No problem.
Huh?
Apparently Chisaki's here.
She said she'd be late because of her internship...
Maybe we just missed her.
Sorry I'm late.
Um...
Is something the matter?
I'm gonna go take a look again.
Then I'll go, too.
You don't need to go to Shishio with the others, Miuna?
I've decided to leave Shishio
to Hikari and the others.
Is something wrong?
I was just thinking that since we're all the same age now,
it'd be nice if we could do more things together.
And it'd be even nicer if we could get closer to their circle.
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, about Manaka-san...
How about stimulating her five senses?
Like stimulating her ears by playing her a song?
Yeah, that sounds good.
Uroko-sama's nowhere to be found.
Miuna-chan said she met him in the village.
Let's take a look at the outskirts of the village, too.
Right, Hikari?
Yeah.
The song's changed.
It reminds me of the day of the Ofunehiki.
Yeah...
Every day at this time,
I remember that day.
That's it!
Manaka heard this song, too, right?
I think I might have come up with a good idea.
Oshiooshi Fishery Cooperative
Local Mascot Character Name Ideas: Oshiosshii Sea Slug-kun Narunamimaru
That's a great idea.
Right?
If we let her listen to things from the festival,
something will like...
Scenes from that day will come up in her head.
We think that might just wake Manaka up.
But people have been coming and going quite a bit since then...
Gather whomever you can!
So Itaru-san...
Please!
We beg of you.
Everyone...
All right.
I'll go contact some people, so could you wait a little while?
I'm back.
I'm back.
Thanks for your hard work, you two.
I'm back, Tsumugu.
The bath's ready for you.
Okay, thanks.
Be careful.
Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go.
You guys really are complicated.
Hikari's pretty late.
Chisaki-chan and Kaname are with him, too, right?
Yeah.
I was a little worried about those three at first, but...
Chisaki-chan's been coming by a lot more often lately.
Now if only Manaka-chan would wake up...
Manaka Wake Up
Yeah...
By the way, apparently Hikari and the others
asked the fishery cooperative to record the song for them.
-Sounds to stimulate her ears...? -... from the sea. -Nostalgic music: like from the Ofunehiki
What?
He's gathering people from the Ofunehiki five years ago
in the hope that it might wake Manaka-chan up.
I think Itaru-san was pretty happy because he called me about it.
Even though he wasn't the one who thought of it, he's super excited.
I see...
Hikari?
Oh, I'm back.
Damn it.
I couldn't catch Uroko today either.
Oh, yeah.
We got a lot of homework today, so let's do it together.
That's right... Everyone was complaining about it.
There really isn't that much time.
Maybe I'll take some time off from school.
What?!
That'll give me a lot more time,
and I'll be able to do a lot more.
N-No!
No? Why?
I mean...
we're still required to go to school!
What are you being all serious for?
And Mom will be really worried!
Akari's not my mom.
Yeah, but...
Taking time off from school...
If she doesn't ever wake up...
What the hell do you mean by that?
I didn't...
Fine. Got it.
I just have to go to school, right?
H-Hikari!
Wai
That's not it...
That's not what I wanted to say...
Damn it!
Hii-kun.
Manaka...
You...
I was fine just the way I was.
Because I was gone,
the sea and the surface kept freezing...
And I...
Where's Hikari?
He left for the sea a while ago.
He said he'd go to school straight from there.
Ketchup!
Hey, Akira! What do you think you're doing?
And so, the Warring States era finally came to an end...
And finally, the 260 years...
People who push their own feelings onto others are awful, aren't they?
Library
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the protagonist in this book.
You're not allowed to read books that don't concern Manaka-san today.
But we've been sitting here for three hours.
Even my concentration is...
or rather, what are you reading?
It's an actual relevant book.
Learning About Sleep The True State of Hypnosis
Isn't that a little off?
We don't know where we'll find a clue about her waking up.
Are you actually thinking about this?
I am!
What are you reading?
Well...
You know, I've been thinking...
Don't princes do that often?
Kiss the sleeping princess?
I think someone should try that
on the sleeping Manaka-san.
Wh a-a kiss?!
It's not weird.
I think that strong feelings for someone
have the power to change something drastically.
Strong feelings?
There are people who have that...
Like Hikari.
B-But it wouldn't be good to kiss her
if there's no solid proof that it'll help.
Well, do you have a better idea?
Not... right now.
Then why does it matter?
But that's
You sound like you don't really want Manaka-san to wake up.
You're the one who just said we don't know where we might find a clue.
I'm being pretty serious about this...
Do I really not want Manaka-san to wake up?
It's no use.
I guess I'll go look for Uroko-sama again.
Hoi, hoi!
Ow!
Hey, Akira!
The Ofunehiki Song
Hoi, hoi.
I want Manaka-san to wake up...
That's what I should have been thinking this whole time.
Was I the only one that was somewhere else?
Manaka!
When did you wake up?
Oh, it's you, Miuna.
Sorry.
Hikari?!
Hikari?
Hikari?!
He must have been exhausted.
I'll have him stay home from school tomorrow.
You should get to bed, too, Miuna.
It'll be no good if everyone keels over.
Miuna?
You're still here?
Isn't it almost time for you to leave for school?
Miu has a fever, too?
Well...
let's just say that she does.
Good morning!
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
Apparently Miuna and Hikari have a cold.
Both of them are absent?
Yeah.
Um...
Are you okay, Kaname?
The sea's cold, and you've been going in with Hikari, right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I see.
Thank goodness.
That Hikari, trying too hard.
Even though Miuna and I and everyone else are here, too.
Take your seats.
We're about to begin.
I'll have to take notes for three people today.
For three people?
Miuna's been taking notes for Manaka-san for when she wakes up.
Oh, that's why.
I'll help with taking notes.
Eh?
I'll help, too.
Miuna.
Hikari's sleeping pretty well,
so I'm going to take Akira and go shopping.
Okay.
Keep an eye on the house.
And you told Hikari not to rest...
Do I really not want Manaka-san to wake up?
This is...
Ow! Hey, Akira!
Hikari, hot.
Get off me.
Hikari, fever.
The Ofunehiki Song
I have to go find Uroko-sama...
I'm gonna be the one who wakes her up...
It's gonna be me...
Hikari is always so straight and narrow and bright.
The Ofunehiki Song
I'm pretty sure that
his feelings for Manaka-san make him like that.
And yet I...
It's been reported that just like in mountain climbing and free diving,
when you put yourself into dangerous situations,
Water
there's a rarely seen phenomenon,
that in order to stay alive,
To solve why Mukaido-san is still sleeping and why Shiodome-san has Ena...
your dormant survival instincts
bring changes upon your body.
We believe that your Ena is also a result
of your dormant sea-person powers awakening because you were pushed to the limit.
The professor would like to talk to you again.
Is there a day that works best for you?
Well, Tsumugu?
When do you think we can see her?
One moment.
Miuna.
Can you come out right now?
You awake?
You had quite a fever,
but it's gone down now.
Make sure you thank Miuna.
She's been watching over you up until now.
What about Manaka?
There haven't been any changes.
Hikari, I understand how you feel, but...
you should rely on those around you a bit more.
What the heck?
You're lecturing a sick person?
You're not the only one who cares about Manaka-chan.
I know that.
You sure about that?
Oh, those...
Kaname-kun and Sayu-chan brought them by.
So you guys won't be behind in your studies.
Corn Soup
Here.
Thanks.
You sure you're okay with that?
Tangerine Juice
Yeah.
I like this.
I guess I really am hard to understand.
Huh? Why?
I mean...
The guys from Shishio are overflowing with emotions.
I've always been a little envious of that.
You, too.
I don't know about me.
It's probably not a good thing.
Because I'm not like Hikari and the others.
Before when Hikari saw my Ena,
he said I was just like them.
But... I wonder why...
Why is Manaka-san losing her Ena
and why did I gain Ena?
I'm the only one with different feelings toward Manaka-san.
I said something weird to Hikari and upset him.
If she doesn't ever wake up...
I thought of the worst thing.
Do I really not want Manaka-san to wake up?
Even I...
seriously thought it'd be better
if they didn't wake up.
Huh?
I felt like Chisaki would disappear from me,
and I was scared.
But in the end,
once they woke up, I was really happy.
Happy?
It's weird, isn't it?
But I was happy.
You were scared but happy?
Yeah.
I wonder...
if I'll be able to be happy, too.
It's hard for you because they're both precious to you.
Both Hikari and Mukaido.
I want to be able to be happy.
I want to be able to say I'm glad
from the bottom of my heart.
You'll be able to.
Apparently they've taken notes for you while you were out.
Miuna and the others took them for you.
Hikari.
She's going to wake up, right?
Yeah.
She will. No matter what.
Yeah.
Hey, Hikari.
There's something Sayu was telling me.
Sayu did?
Yeah.
Strong feelings for someone have the ability to change something drastically.
She's pretty sure that you have
powers like that, Hikari.
So...
A-Anyway...
Kiss!
Huh?
Kiss!
Wha...
Wh-What are you saying?!
What am I saying?
Oh!
N-No, that's not it!
I'm saying that you should kiss Manaka-san!
Wha?! Either way, why would I do that?!
Because it's needed for her to wake up!
That makes no sense!
And why would that need a k-kiss?!
I already told you!
That's not a reason!
Hii-kun!
You're not supposed to get that mad at girls!
Shut up! It's because she
Huh?
How was she? How was Mukaido?
She was so energetic, it startled me.
This feels so weird.
Manaka is Manaka.
Looks like you're back...
