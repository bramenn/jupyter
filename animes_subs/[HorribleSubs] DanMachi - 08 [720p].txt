This shell can only be broken by those who go on adventures.
Level 6?
It was the thirty-seventh floor, I think?
She defeated a deep dungeon floor boss all by herself, I heard.
By herself?
Normally, beating one of those
things calls for a huge party of skilled adventurers,
and it'll still be close.
You can't compare yourself to her, Bell-kun.
Even I've never even heard of anybody like her.
Miss Wallenstein is special.
I want to get closer to her, even if it's just a little.
One more time, please!
How are you able to get so strong, so fast?
It's not fast, and I'm not strong at all.

Bell-san!
S-Syr-san?
I really wanted to find you.
Washing dishes?
Sorry.
I skipped out onI mean, took a break
from some work that was piling up,
and Mama Mia got mad at me.
And as a punishment...
I've got nothing to do with this at all!
Sorry, Bell-san.
Thanks so much!
But it might be nice to not think about anything for a while.
A truly formidable task lies before you.
I'll help.
Ryuu-san?
Um, Ryuu-san, were you an adventurer?
Yes, in the past.
Why?
What do you have to do to level up?
Do you just have to defeat a lot of monsters?
No, that's not enough.
You need to do something big.
In practice, you must defeat a powerful opponent.
B-But you can beat somebody like that?
Usually, it's difficult.
But skills and strategy make it possible.
Your skills and strategy are lacking.
That's not enough to win, though.
Normally, you would form a party.
If you really want to be strong,
eventually you'll need to join a party.
Even when you couldn't win on your own, members of a party can compensate
for each other's weaknesses, and defeat powerful opponents together.
In other words, Cranel-san, if you want to go up a level,
you need to go on an adventure.
There are as many meanings to adventure as there are people.
I don't know what kind of adventure you'll face.
But do not turn away from what it signifies.
You are an adventurer.
To be adventurous is probably the only way to get what you desire.
But my intuition is sometimes wrong, of course.
This was the first time you could counterattack, wasn't it?
Yeah.
This is our last day.
Thank you for all you've done this past week.
Thank you, too.
It was fun.
Do your best.
Yes. You, too, Aiz-san...
Um, do your best.
I don't know if I can catch up to her.
But I have to do it anyway.
I'll chase her until I can reach out and touch her.
And then...
Then your training with Wallenwhatsit really ended this morning, right?
Yes. As planned, the Loki Familia is going on an expedition today.
I see... it's done, huh?
But still, this ability...
Bye, Goddess! I'll be back!
Hey, Bell-kun! Your status!
Sorry! I'll look at it when I get back!
Bell-kun! Bell-kun!
What is this thing?
We will now begin our expedition deep into the dungeon.
Once again, to avoid crowding the upper floors, we'll split into two teams.
I'll take team one.
Gareth will command team two.
Blacksmiths from the Hephaestus Familia will accompany us.
We'll meet on the 18th floor.
From there, we'll head directly to the 50th floor.
Our goal is nothing less than the 59th floor, which has never before been reached.
The preparations are complete.
A greedy adventurer opened the box,
and revealed it ahead of schedule, though.
I see.
It's time for that child show to show me an adventure.
Is something wrong, Bell-sama?
Do you sense anything, Lili?
Like somebody's watching us?
I couldn't say.
But there does seem to be something off about this floor.
Yeah.
There are too few monsters.
And too few adventurers.
It was like this on that day, too.
Let's go, Lili.
Uh, okay.
What was that?
Why is there a minotaur on the ninth floor?
Bell-sama, let's run!
We're not strong enough to fight it now!
Hurry!
Bell-sama?
Bell-sama! Bell-sama!
Get a hold of yourself!
Lili...
Lili!
I'm sorry!
Firebolt!
Firebolt! Firebolt! Firebolt!
A minotaur appeared?
Yeah, I'm sure of it.
There was a minotaur with a huge sword on the ninth floor.
Could it be a survivor from last time?
I doubt it.
It's been a month, and there's been no minotaur sightings.
Either way, I'm glad you guys are safe.
What about other adventurers?
There's one under attack in a chamber that's pretty far back.
It's that white-haired kid. I'm sure by now
Aiz!
Hey! This is an expedition, y'know!
Bete! Tiona!
Sorry, Raul. Can you handle things here?
Okay!
This is just like last time.
You're a coward, aren't you?
He's going to kill me sooner or later.
I need to find a chance to escape.
Bell... Bell-sama!
Lili!
Lili, run!
Run!
No!
Run!
I can't!
Just get going!
This is for the best.
Now I'll be able to escape, too...
No, I can't!
If I let him get past me right now, Lili will die!
Damn it!
If I just dodge, if I make it a contest of speed, I can keep up!
I'll keep dodging his attacks.
Even if it's miserable or pathetic!
I just need to buy time!
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
You did your best. I'll save you now.
Save...
I'm going to be saved?
Again? By her?
The same way?
Just the same thing again?
Who?
Me?
If I don't stand up here...
If I don't reach higher here...
When am I ever going to do it?
There you are, Aiz!
What are you doing?
I can't...
I can't let Aiz Wallenstein save me again!
Today, for the first time...
I'm going to have an adventure.
Well, it's against the rules to steal somebody else's target in a dungeon.
Hey, is that the tomato kid?
Wow! I guess he's got a thing for minotaurs!
The one Aiz saved?
Yeah.
I bet Horn-head over there wanted to see the tomato boy
so bad he came all the way up here!
That's not funny, Bete.
I'm sure he doesn't want to be saved again.
Not by the girl who saw him looking so pathetic
last time, just like this!
You sure about this?
That kid's level 1, right?
He's not going to survive.
Leave the kid alone, Tiona.
He's being a man right now.
If I was him, and I got saved again, I'd want to kill myself.
Please...
Great adventurers... Please save Bell-sama.
Hey, let me go!
Please!
You shouldn't move yet, little prum.
It took all of your strength just to come here with us.
I'll repay you.
I'll do anything.
Anything!
So save Bell-sama!
Please...
Bell-sama... Bell-sama...
You're going?
Don't get the wrong idea.
I don't like saving chumps.
But I don't like the idea being a chump who picks on wimps even more.
Move, Aiz.
I'm handling this.
Isn't he level 1?
A month ago, to Bete's eyes, he seemed completely inexperienced.
Am I wrong?
What the hell happened?
This is my adventure.
I want to be...
I want to be a hero!
Like the Argonaut...
It's the story of a boy who wants to be a hero, yeah.
I liked that story, too.
Beautiful...
What a beautiful sight.
What the heck is that knife?
It's well-made, yes.
But that's not all.
It's his own skills.
He's holding his own very well.
But he can't land a blow.
It's hard to cut a minotaur's flesh.
Bell-sama...
Firebolt!
He didn't chant anything for that spell!
Yeah. But he's up against a bad opponent for that.
It's not strong enough.
Then he's done for?
So young.
That idiot.
Bell-sama!
It's all right.
Firebolt!
Firebolt!
Firebolt!
Bell-sama...
That bastard pulled it off.
He passed out on his feet.
Mind zero.
Bell-sama! Bell-sama!
Bell-sama!
Riveria, what's his status?
You want me to look without permission?
He's basically begging for us to take a look, isn't he?
What are his stats? Tell me already!
All abilities are rank S.
What's his name?
Bell.
Bell Cranel.
You did well today.
Congratulations.
Goddess,
This is...
The first page of our story.
