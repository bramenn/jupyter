Hamu, how's it going?
Hamu?
Yes, sir. This is Hamu. As ordered, I brought those two here.
Those Drifters appear to be two old men,
but they are in the midst of a heated fight.
Thief! Thief! Why the hell is this two-bit thief here?!
Who're you calling two-bit thief?!
You are the one who should be called that!
Justice lies with the victor.
Shut up! You stole it from me, idiot!
You copied my strategy from Cannae and used it in Zama, moron!
What are you talking about, you old fool?!
Why don't you show me you can win, then?!
Grrr, why are you talking like a chosen one, you idiot?!
I didn't steal it, since I won the war fair and square!
That's why I hate the Romans!
When I go back, I will salt all of Carthage!
When I go back, I will cross the Alps one more time!
What would you like me to do, Grand Master?
Stop them.
Yes, sir.
The issue is that their intentions...
The Octobrists
We must find out what they are somehow...
Act 2 Footsteps
You two, I've told you so many times!
You guys went to that deserted castle again, didn't you?
I've repeatedly told you not to get involved with Drifters!
I've warned you about entering the forest, going to that deserted castle,
and associating with Drifters!
If the lord and his men ever find out, they will kill you!
But he was dying.
No buts!
Stay away from them, got it?! Am I understood?!
Damn it! It's before the harvest. Well, let's go!
You've noticed, huh?
What is...
Is this the smell of battle?
There's fire.
They are the Elves.
There must be bandits or brigands.
The Elves are under attack. I smell the battle.
What are Elves?
They are the strange folks who live beyond the forest.
The ones with long ears who dragged you here.
Hey!
Hey! Wait! Are you going over there?!
I don't know where I am or what's going on!
I don't know if this is a dream or reality!
So, the only thing left for me is to charge forward!
He's the idiot, not me. He was dying not long ago.
Is he a human bullet or something?
Are they on the move?
Let's go!
What are they going to do? What will happen to them?
You're slow, too slow, Nobunaga!
What's wrong with you, Demon King of the Sixth Heaven?
Shut up! I'm already fifty, you idiot!
How old are you, Lord Toyohisa?
I'm thirty.
Nineteen
What's with that smug smile?!
This punk is completely different from the character in the
chronicle of the Genpei War.
He-Help...
Hey, kids!
Leave your head with me! All right?!
Wh-Who the hell are you?!
Are you the Drifters in the deserted castle?
I don't understand you. I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Speak Japanese.
If you can't speak Japanese...
You two have strange-looking ears.
You two saved my life, didn't you? Now it's my turn.
Mutter mutter mutter
Are you okay with these two?
They can't speak Japanese, either.
Why don't you tell them to die, too?
Help! Repeat after me. Help!
Say it! Help! Help!
Help, help, help!
Good! That's that, then!
Rumble rumble rumble
Way to force the conclusion you want.
I've just witnessed fast-talking on par with that of the Ikko sect.
They are very well equipped. They can't be brigands or bandits...
Regular soldiers? Are they the lord's forces?
These idiots. It's like they're asking me to seize their land.
Okay, now.
Let's claim the village.
Claim? Did he actually say, claim?
Yes.
Instead of saying take back, or help them, he said, claim, right?
That's their nature, and it's innate and pathological.
It's their most powerful ability.
No. It's the only ability they have.
No matter when or where they live, they have only one governing principle.
They want to conquer territory.
Line up!
What on earth is going on? What are you accusing us of?
You entered the forest and saved a Drifter, didn't you?
Entering the forest, making bows, and associating with Drifters...
These are all serious crimes for Elves.
Th-That was...
In order to save a dying man, the children...
Children? Is that the reason you're asking me to overlook this?
You Elves are really disgraceful and insolent.
The administration of Drifters is a job for magicians of the Octobrist Organization.
It's a serious crime for demihumans like you to get involved.
Did you think we didn't notice?
Shut up!
First of all, you've been unreasonable!
We wouldn't be able to get firewood or nuts without entering the forest!
Or even hunt!
You've forced us to work as serfs and have taken our women away from us.
Now, these children save a dying man and you call it a crime?!
Are you telling us Elves to die?!
That's right. You all should just die.
If you want to curse at somebody,
put the blame on your ancestors who lost the war.
Someday, Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, and all demihuman races will be extinct.
Isn't that right?
Wh-What are you doing?!
I'm just culling your population. How many shall I take?
I was told I'm allowed to eliminate up to 50 of you.
Stop!
Take my life instead. Kill me!
No! You're still young. You have to take care of yourself.
You have a future... as a pathetic serf.
As for your brothers who saved the Drifter, they're finished.
They started this whole mess.
They're probably corpses by now.
They'll become feed for the insects of the forest.
It's an emergency!
What's wrong?!
There is a fire in the wheat filed.
What the hell?!
It's before the harvest time! I'll lose the tax money!
I've been telling you to keep an eye on it, haven't I?!
You set fire to their field?
Yeah. Those without dignity can survive if they have food to eat.
Those without food can endure their hunger as long as they have dignity.
But those who have lost both stop caring and desperately cling to anything.
That was the tactic the Ikko sect kept employing against me.
It's the best way to steal a country.
You're a frightening person.
The fire still looks good!
It reminds me of Ise Nagashima.
Our field...
What are you doing?! Put out the fire! Now!
It's impossible. It has spread too far!
What on earth...
Dr... if... ter!
One!
What?!
What the hell just happened?!
H-How could...?!
Two!
Three!
Stop running! I'll kill you!
Four!
That's a commander's head.
You're the commander, right?
You, leave your head here! That's the head of the commander, huh?
This must be a Drifter. What the hell is he saying?!
That is... a Drifter!
Brother...!
Brother!
Masha! Mark! You're alive!
That man...
That scary-looking man saved our lives.
That Drifter!
What on earth?!
What are Drifters?
Drifter, are you interfering with me?
How...
How dare you?!
I don't want your head. Just leave your life here!
I don't know what on earth you are talking about.
You, a barbarian who can't even speak!
We'll talk with swords!
Come, Drifter!
Aram is not an ordinary soldier.
He is a real knight backed by the magistrate.
Even a Drifter can't...
Indeed! Are you afraid?
Pitiful!
Here we go!
You're pitiful.
The Kumite style anti-armor technique with the sheath of a sword...
That's nasty!
Wow... scary.
Is it finished?
Yes.
The enemies who were fleeing are no more.
That guy is scary, but so are you.
Well, what is he going to do now?
S-Stop...
Kill him.
Finish him off.
No, kill him. Kill him. You must put an end to his life.
I don't know where we are or who you are,
but this is the revenge you must take.
This kid is telling you to avenge him!
They can't understand his words, but they know what he's been telling them.
He is quite something...
Stop! You damn Elves...
Stop! Stop!
Don't you know the consequences...?!
I was wrong... S-Stop!
Help!
Good!
Well done...
All right!
Where the hell were you? You know I'm still recuperating!
Well, we've been busy with other things.
Rumble rumble rumble
Yes, indeed.
Well, well, you must be tired. Please take a seat.
I was going to sit down, but I'll let you take my seat.
Gleam
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! I can't believe this!
Grand Master, those guys...
Those guys!
Shimazu Toyohisa Seizes Control of Elf Village?!
You're still wasting your time struggling, huh, Murasaki?
No matter how hard you try, no matter how many Drifters you send,
I'm going to win.
No matter how much effort you make, it's all futile.
Get out of here, Easy. The wrongs must be righted.
Get lost, Easy. I won't let you have your way.
Pathetic woman.
You're the pathetic one.
If you think you can do it, go ahead and try!
Black King Commences Southern Invasion
There's no way your Drifters could possibly beat my Ends!
This is Semu, this is Semu!
Grand Master, they finally seized the village!
It's dangerous to let them run loose! I'll bring them there immediately!
No, that won't work. There's no time for that.
Don't bring them here. Don't you come, either.
What?! So then...
Yes. It's begun.
It's already begun!
