Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
The Debugger program 3.5 has been activated.
Proliferation Level A!
The Earth's stability level has dropped to 0.833.
How bad is the proliferation?
We can't stop it! How bad is the proliferation?
The Debugger program has been destroyed!
How can there be so many of them?
The bugs are proliferating at an increased rate...
The Earth's stability level has now dropped to 0.331 !
At this rate, there will be an aberration on Earth.
Oh, do something, will you?
I found the cause. Here it is!
My sister Belldandy... is the cause?
Ah! Who Does Big Sister Belong To?
I'm off, see you later!
Have a good day!
All right.
Sleipnir?
What are you doing here?
Keiichi!
What the heck is going on here?
Keiichi!
Belldandy!
Please don't move... just stay still!
Keiichi... give me your hand!
There's nothing like a nice hot bath in the morning...
Keiichi?
When did you get to be so bold?
There must have been some kind of glitch in Yggdrasil.
What's this'Yggdrasil'?
It's our control system up in Heaven.
Belldandy!
Could you help me send Sleipnir back?
Oh, yes, all right. I'll be right back.
It sounds like a lot of trouble...
Whoa!
That's hot!
Do you have to drink tea, of all things? I could've burned myself!
Um...
Where's Big Sister? Um...
Big Sister?
Wait a minute, are you...
Where is my Big Sister?
Big Sister!
Skuld?
Big Sister!
Big Sister!
I missed you so much! Big Sister!
You look like you're doing well, Skuld. But why did you come down here?
Oh, that's right... It's a big mess up there in Heaven!
It's your job to look after Yggdrasil. How can you just abandon the system?
You're the one who crashed the server!
Who's been living without a care in the world down here on Earth?
So what's the problem with Yggdrasil?
There's been an unprecedented outbreak of bugs in the system.
Things are precarious now, so I need you to come back to Heaven right away!
Go back?
Is the problem that serious?
So you're Keiichi Morisato, huh?
Uh, that's right.
This is all your fault, you know!
My fault?
So, the main computer or something in Heaven suffered...
Yes. But as I explained to you earlier, Yggdrasil is Heaven's control system...
For instance, my teacup could suddenly disappear...
Or Sleipnir could appear all of a sudden, like he did just now...
Or it could cause something like this all of a sudden, right?
Keiichi!
But how can this be my fault?
It is your fault!
We had a massive outbreak of bugs today because Yggdrasil was...
My heart has become unstable?
Right, the only cause for that can be...
Is that right?
Terminate the contract right now, and let Big Sister go back to Heaven!
Skuld, this has nothing to do with Keiichi.
But...
The first thing to do is to make sure the bugs don't have an effect on Earth.
I know you're up to the task!
Big Sister...
They're here already!
All right!
Take that!
Over there!
Okay, I'm on it!
Take that!
Belldandy!
Right!
What the heck is this?
For crying out loud, what is this? There's a whole load of them!
We'd better exterminate them quickly. Keiichi, please stay there.
Sure.
Ready... set...
GO!
Take that! Take that! Take that!
Hey, don't lose control!
Ugh...
I'm exhausted.
But I'm sure we got rid of a significant number.
Argh!
No good! No good! No good! There's no end in sight!
Hey!
Keiichi?
I'm over here!
Keiichi!
My! Keiichi, you cutie you!
You're choking me!
Are you all right?
I got chased by a cat. It was awful!
Is that right? I'm so sorry.
Don't be. It's not your fault, Belldandy. So what's going on with the bugs?
Whoa! There's that many?
See, you have to come back, Big Sister!
Having a good-for-nothing sister brings you no end of headaches!
I'll go back to Heaven.
There is no point doing that!
What do you mean?
Didn't you hear me? Big Sister's the cause!
Please, come back.
But I'm here on a mission from the Goddess Help Line... to be with Keiichi...
I know you have a strong sense of responsibility, and I really respect that.
But if we don't do something, Keiichi will be in danger...
Well, that's true, but...
Skuld's a serious kid, isn't she?
No, I can tell she's hiding something.
Skuld?
What?
Didn't you invent a Bug-zapping Machine a long time ago?
Doh!
You said there'd be nothing left to worry about with that machine...
Oh, that? Um... well, it broke down, see?
It broke down...
Broke down? My, how unusual for you.
'My inventions are flawless, so they never break down!'
Isn't that what you told us?
What a letdown! That's the one thing about you I thought was awesome...
But what's this? You make defective inventions that break down?
I've never made a defective invention! I can get it to work anytime if I want...
I knew it!
Skuld...
Well, since Big Sister left Heaven...
There you go again, you crybaby.
Oh, you shut up! There you go again, you crybaby.
You're the one who dumped all the work on me!
I understand now. But you know we can't leave things the way they are.
Yes, Big Sister.
Are you sure this really works?
That's rude! Don't you dare make fun of my Bug Paku-paku!
He'll obliterate every last bug in a mere five minutes!
Combining form with a gorgeous design!
What a masterpiece!
Does she have a mechanical fetish?
Never mind that, has anyone seen Urd? Does she have a mechanical fetish?
Never mind that, has anyone seen Urd?
Let's get started!
What are you doing?
To safeguard against any errors, I always do this before touching the machine.
Skuld's inventions are renowned as among the best in all of Heaven.
All right, let's activate him!
Come on! You should be helping me catch those bugs, too!
Huh? There's one right there!
No, stop!
Take that!
Urd!
It's your fault for leaving it out here!
This is why I don't like you, Urd!
Hey, hold up... what's going to happen now that the machine's destroyed?
The thing is...
Keiichi!
Urd!
What's going on?
Urd!
Oh, no! The effects from the bugs are getting stronger!
AUTO CLUB
Nothing beats spending all afternoon working on machines like this...
Dai-chan, hand me a towel.
Here you go, Den-chan. Dai-chan, hand me a towel.
Morisato!
Since when did you become an iron-on patch?
I'm not so sure myself... but the thing is, your sweat smells pretty bad.
Yeah? Just hold on a sec.
You think this is his new part-time job or something?
Wh-what the heck is going on here?
I'm picking up a neutrino up ahead!
Let's go, then.
I'm sorry.
I never thought it'd turn out like this. I was worried about you, Big Sister.
Worried?
Big Sister, your heart is always so peaceful and kind, but now it's become...
I was sure that you must have been really suffering for that to happen...
I'm not suffering at all.
It's just that...
Wait! He's down there!
Let's hurry, then!
Huh? How could I have gained weight?
That's because of me.
What?
When did you sneak in here? You're trespassing, you know!
No, wait, I can explain this...
Keiichi, are you all right?
Somehow...
Hold on a minute.
This will protect you from the bugs' effects for a while.
That's good to hear! In that case, if you don't mind...
Keiichi!
Keiichi!
Are you awake now?
You've had to go through so much because of us...
That's okay. At least I could go back to normal.
Never mind that... are you really okay with all this?
What?
I mean, Skuld did say your heart was unstable...
Yes, but I don't really understand why myself.
That's why I'm planning to go back to Heaven tomorrow morning.
I see. And how long do you think it will take?
I don't know.
Time flows differently in Heaven than it does here on Earth...
A single second in Heaven can equal several hundred years down here.
You mean...
That's right.
But...
But I'm not going to terminate our contract.
No matter how long it takes, I promise I'll come back.
I promise.
All right.
I'll be waiting, too... I promise.
Keiichi!
I'm so bored!
Isn't there anything good on TV?
I wish you'd just stay inside that TV forever!
Big Sister!
I've decided to go back to Heaven tomorrow morning.
For real?
Are we going back together?
You're going back with me, Big Sister? That's great!
Big Sister's coming back!
We can be together again!
What did Keiichi say? We can be together again!
Did he?
So now you can finally go back to Heaven!
Aren't you excited, Big Sister?
Aren't you, Big Sister?
Well?
Hmm? Oh, um... yes.
Then when we get back, you'll sing for me again, won't you?
Yes.
And I want to learn how to use magic soon. I want you to teach me, okay?
Of course.
Oh, and...
Big Sister?
If my heart is unstable, then it might be because of...
The way you're feeling now?
Yes.
It's the same way I felt the other day...
That feeling of being separated from Keiichi...
Big Sister...
Can I talk to you for a second?
I'm really sorry about Belldandy.
I had no idea you were feeling so lonely, Skuld.
I am not feeling lonely!
Would you mind not treating me like a kid?
You're right... sorry about that.
But you're going back together, right? That must make you happy.
No, it doesn't!
I thought Big Sister was staying here because of her contract...
None of us thinks you're a villain.
Why did you have to make a wish like that?
Well...
Out of all the other wishes you could've made, too!
But you had to go and ask her to stay with you...
That's right... I don't know why myself.
Oh, give me a break!
It's true, those words just suddenly came out of my mouth...
That I wanted Belldandy to stay with me forever...
Rats.
Give me a hand, Keiichi.
Huh?
I want you to gather all the viable parts you can find around the house.
I'll rebuild Bug Paku-paku!
Can you do that?
Of course I can! Who do you think I am?
Goddess Second Class, First Category, Limited, Belldandy's younger sister...
All right, then, let's roll!
He's good to go now!
We did it!
Yeah! We're all set!
Thanks.
Uh-huh!
Good morning!
Good morning. You're up early today, aren't you?
Belldandy, do you have a minute?
Look at this, Big Sister!
It's Bug Paku-paku! I'm going to activate him now!
And if we get him up and running, she says you won't have to go back!
Skuld!
Keiichi!
But is that thing really going to work?
Don't be so rude! I'm absolutely sure he'll work! After all, it was me who...
It was Keiichi and I who made him.
All right, here we go.
Please... just work!
Skuld...
Don't worry!
I'm sure...
All right!
To be expected from Belldandy's sister!
That's right. To be expected from Belldandy's sister!
And now I can stay by your side, Keiichi!
Okay, okay, step back now, step back!
I've decided to stay here on Earth.
Huh?
After all, I have to keep an eye on you two to make sure Big Sister...
Skuld!
No use trying to stop me, either!
I've already applied for my Earth Training License.
So here's the scoop, as long as I'm around...
Touchy-feely?
Touchy-feely means touchy-feely!
Now move farther away from her!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a wing!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a wing!
I love you so much it hurts...
And it hurts me that I can't tell you how I feel.
You and I have matching hearts...
So we must share the same scars deep down inside.
But now that I'm in your arms, I think I can catch...
Nobody else matters... All we have to do is gaze at each other.
It's all right for your heart to flutter... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
Don't run away from happiness.
I'll always be waiting for you.
So come rest your wings anytime.
It's all right to cry... anytime you need to.
I just want to see you again... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
I just want you to be happy.
Rivals...
Although they acknowledge each other's power, they are destined for a showdown.
With their pride on the line, the two kid sisters take hold of the controls.
