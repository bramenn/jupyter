These the massive, hostile creatures who traverse space-time, known as DRAGON.
To protect human territory by intercepting and destroying them
is the task of the Norma at Arzenal.
We Norma are allowed to live in this world only as weapons that kill DRAGONs.
Let's not forget that as we give our all to fight them.
Yes, ma'am.
Understand, Ange?
We have a lot of learning and training to do.
The Empire of Misurugi will send a release order for me soon.
And once you're ready, you'll serve the humans as riders and mechanics.
Officer, we're done educating Ange.
We're assigning her to First Troop today.
That will be your purpose in life.
First Troop?!
Zola has already been informed.
Let's go.
Let go.
So that's the princess everyone's talking about.
The pure-bodied princess...
She sounds sweet and delicious.
You don't care as long it's somebody new, right?
What, are you jealous?
You girls are so cute.
Captain,
take it easy with the skinship.
We get complaints about how hard you massage the newcomers.
Fine, fine. I'll be careful, Deputy Chief.
She's an older newcomer, but be nice to her, you two.
R-Right.
R-Right.
Hey, Salia, time for a quiz!
Who's going to die first?
It's our job to teach them so they won't die.
Ow, ow! I'm going to die!
Getting along well today, too, I see.
Disobedient Soul
Salute the commander.
You handle the rest, Zola.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Captain Zola.
Deputy Chief, introduce her.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Deputy Chief Salia.
And this is our assault soldier, Vivian.
What's up?
And Hilda.
Rosalie is our light artillery.
Are these...
Are these all Norma?
These?
We Norma are treated as things.
You bitch!
Yep, we're all Norma, just like you.
We'll be good friends, okay?
I am not!
I am the Empire of Misurugi's First Princess, Angelise Ikaruga Misurugi.
But you can't use Mana, right?
Th-The Light of Mana just doesn't reach this far.
In the State, I assure you...
Damn you, Captain. You brought us a crazy one!
She's not even aware of her situation. She's defective.
So the defect is being condescending?
Oh, ouch.
What a burn.
You're the defects!
Know your place,
Burn Princess.
Come on, people, let's leave it there.
What? We need to smack the delusion out of ugly bitches like her.
Exactly.
Yup.
True, but...
Ange isn't that ugly.
You're always too soft, Ersha.
Salia, you take care of her. Teach her everything.
That's why the newcomers always act tough.
Yes, ma'am.
Be nice to the promising newcomer, everyone.
We're all Norma here.
All right, we're starting training.
Ersha, Rosalie, Chris...
Come with me.
We'll be doing long-range attack patterns.
Yes.
Salia, Hilda, Vivian, you're training the newcomer.
Buckle down.
Yes.
Go.
Yes, ma'am.
This way, Ange.
No one may give orders to royalty.
Here, your superiors' orders are absolute.
Got it?
Here's your Rider suit.
Get changed.
That's too scandalous for me.
What's this?
Oh, that's the previous owner. She's dead.
I-I'm wearing a dead person's clothes?
If you want a new one, you'll have to buy it yourself.
I'd rather be naked than wear that.
Oh?
Ew, what's going on?
She's naked? Seriously?
Open up! Hurry!
You'd rather be naked, wouldn't you?
They're just like the Institute said.
How barbaric and crude and violent!
What are you doing?
Help me, please.
You've never put your own clothes on before?
Man, you're worse than a kid.
My, my, you're swollen red.
It's so tender.
Does it hurt? Does it?
It does, doesn't it?
You smell like alcohol, Maggy.
Jasmine, how's it going?
The outside bolts are all wrecked.
I'll replace them with ones from the Empire of Misurugi.
It'll cost a bit more, though.
Let command pay for it.
Why, thank you.
Couldn't you be a bit more careful with it?
It's not as durable as you are.
Sorry. That bitch got unruly.
The princess?
Is it really a good idea to put her in First Troop?
If not, she dies. That's all.
Para-mail destroyer mode simulator initializing.
Plenum chamber charging.
Plenum chamber charge complete.
Release arresting gear.
Arresting gear release complete.
This is the main throttle.
This is the indicator.
Just what is this?
A Para-mail simulator.
Para-mail?
Coffins, for us Norma.
I don't expect you to be able to do this on your first try.
First, you need to get a good feel for flying.
Requesting lift-off.
Coco, request confirmed. Beginning lift-off.
Miranda, confirmed.
Just what do you expect me to do?
Ange, confirmed.
Mission 07, start.
What is this?
Don't let go of the controls.
Climb!
Turn!
Look ahead.
Real battle is worse than this.
On to nosedive training.
Begin nosedive.
You're going to hit the ground.
Nose up!
This feeling
Hurry, Ange!
I knew it, this sensation
Ange!
I knew it.
Iaria!
What's up with this kid?
The Princess was impressive.
She didn't wet herself on her first simulation.
Right, Rosalie?
Ah, my first time was, well...
Sounds like you like her.
Yeah, she's not bad.
Hey, Salia, what is Ange?
She's so much fun.
This is your room.
You can have it to yourself until we have new soldiers.
Buy what you need with this.
Roll call is at 5 tomorrow morning.
Onee-sama.
Mother, Sylvia.
Momoka, ready my horse.
Momo
It's cold, Momoka.
That newcomer
Her basic fitness, her reflexes, her combat adaptability,
her understanding of military theory
She's above average in all areas.
She's impressive.
For a Norma, that is.
Noteworthy Para-mail piloting ability, huh?
You're keeping it again?
I want to keep some for later.
It's just pudding. You're such a kid, Coco.
You aren't my older sister.
My, my, the Burn Princess.
Oh, dear. You're so good at everything, but you're picky about food.
That's not good.
You better eat up, or you won't be able to fight.
Nope, not good.
How can you eat that stuff?
Oh, is it not good enough for you, Burn Princess?
Get off your high horse.
You
Stop, Rosalie.
Here's a warning, Burn Princess.
This isn't the world you came from.
You better figure that out quick, or you'll die.
U-Um...
Oh, so you didn't remember my name.
I'm Miranda.
This is Coco.
Come on, this is your chance to get to know her.
B-But
She's infatuated with you.
But Ange-san's so amazing.
You're fast, and strong, and pretty.
She can do everything.
I thought princesses were only in fairy tales.
Well, we're all new soldiers.
Let's stick together, okay, Ange?
Ask me if there's anything you don't know.
Then
Thanks for the business.
Here, and the change.
You can get more cash by making military gains.
So how did you shop outside?
I got everything I wanted.
I could have anything I wanted, and I could be anyone I wanted to.
There's no inequality, violence, or discrimination.
Nothing bad ever happens.
That's our Mana-filled world.
So there really is a magic nation.
Thank you.
Well then.
U-Um...
See you tomorrow, Ange-sama.
It's Angelise.
Okay, Angelise-sama.
What's wrong, finished already?
Please, let me rest a little.
Pathetic.
Where're you going?
I'm not satisfied.
It's an invocation of my entitlements as royalty,
and a petition for my immediate release.
Please have this delivered to the heads of all states.
Right away.
You still don't get it?
What a problem, you are.
She's so thick-headed.
She's been poorly educated, Zola.
I apologize, Commander.
You'll do.
I'll be borrowing the room.
Approved.
Let go of me.
Yes, Arzenal Command.
You won't survive in the field
if you don't understand your situation.
I am returning to the Empire!
If I can't tell you, I'll have to teach your body.
Submit, and I'll teach you pleasures you've never known.
Good, good. That's how Norma have to be.
I-I am not a Norma.
Lose an eye, lose an arm,
and the will to fight still runs through you.
That's us, the Norma.
Hitting me gets you excited.
That's not it.
This brings back memories.
You were sick of it, too, weren't you?
Of that hypocritical, shallow world.
No.
Stop.
It was just getting good!
This is the real deal, Ange.
Connect all power.
Arquebus, Glaive, start engines.
Hauser, hurry up and load weapons.

Come back!
Ange!
My name is Angelise Ikaruga Misurugi.
I am returning to where I belong, in the Empire of Misurugi.
I warned you.
You'll be shot if you disobey orders.
Angelise-sama!
Angelise-sama, take me with you.
What are you talking about, Coco?
Take me to the magic country!
The Singular is opening.
We've lost Coco.
DRAGONs have made contact.
What is this?
What the hell is this?

This week's story was terrible, too!
The food's awful, the rooms are dirty, I lost my first kiss...
Why do I have to go through all this?
Isn't this a bishoujo robot anime?
