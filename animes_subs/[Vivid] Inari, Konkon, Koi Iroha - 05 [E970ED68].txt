It's so hot...
Well, it is summer.
They call it the rice-swelling month because of how big the rice plants grow.
That's great, but it's murder with our coats.
Takin' a dip? Nice!
Miss Inari!
Good morning!
Going away somewhere, are you?
Yup! Is Lady Uka around?
Lady Uka, huh...
She's under that tree...
burning her dating-service portraits.
Oh, Inari!
Come to visit?
I wanted to tell you I'll be away till tomorrow.
I'm goin' to the beach with friends.
Oh, I see. Well then, have fun.
You bet! I'll bring you a souvenir, okay?

Ah, summer!
Gotta love it, seeing all you girls together!
Good thing you finished your manuscript!
Thank you so much for inviting me.
Not at all! You can never have too many friends along.
If only Touka could come too.
Oh, that's Inari's older brother.
He says he's feeling sick.
Sick?
Don't worry. It's just a teenage phase.
You should see the blog he's been writing!

Ugh! What's this?
The Erlkonig's malicious spirit, released through a breach in the Schwarztor?
Here, have some rice crackers.
We've got chips, too.
Thank you.
My parents are always busy with work,
so I've wanted to do something like this for a long time.
I'm really happy to be here.
There, there.
Want some, Maru?
No thanks.
Look outside!
It's the ocean!
The ocean, the ocean...
The ocean!
Hey, girls, you two together?
Huh? There are four of us.
Then we'll get two more buds in on the action!
How'bout some double datin', babe?
It's too hot for this crap. Get lost.
This is wack! How can this chick be stronger than me?!
Attagirl, Keiko!
S-Say, Inari, how about you and I go for a leisurely paddle?
Good idea! Let's do it!
This feels great!
Good. They're definitely gettin' along better than before.
Hurry up, Inari!
O-Okay!
Oh... Inari's having fun.
Her emotions are sparkling.
Good for you, Inari.
Your smile puts my heart at ease.
The beach, huh? Wish I could go too.
You could go all you like back at the Celestial Plains.
I'm sure your father would be happy to see you.
No, not like that. More like what Inari...
Honestly, I don't think it's such a good idea for you to get so close to
It's fine!
I've chosen the proper path. I'm sure of it!
I know full well, and yet...
What was I thinking?
I may be divine, but something's not quite right with me.
Thank you, come again!
What's with her?
She seems pretty down.
Not my problem!
Say, Inari...
Hmm?
Did you do your homework yet?
As if!
I know, right?
I mean, I'm not Sumizome!
Let's stop talkin' about homework and just have fun.
Hey, you brought it up!
Oh, uh... Sorry.
What's wrong, Maru?
Huh?
You've been kinda quiet all day.
Hey! You okay over there?
Oh, they're fine!
Are you all right, Inari?
Yeah.
But if Keiko had been here with us...
She would've drowned for sure.
Keiko sure was somethin' else last year, wasn't she?
She was actin' tougher than the so-called tough guys!
And there was no way she'd let on that she couldn't swim.
So she almost drowned and someone had to pull her out!
What a dork!
This year'll be even more fun, since Sumizome's here!
Hey, Inari?
I don't think I like Sumizome very much.
Huh?
Please don't tell her I said that.
I know Sumizome's a good person and all...
Yeah, she really is!
And I don't hate her...
It's more like we're just not on the same wavelength.
Maru...
Wow... Here we got everyone together for this trip,
but Maru's not even enjoying herself. That sucks.
I know!
Hey, Maru!
Huh?
This trip's all about deepenin' our friendships
Not again!
Hey! You still okay over there?
Oh, they're still fine!
What on Earth are they doing?
It looks fun!
Why don't ya join them?
I can't swim.
Yeah, I'd like to...
But...
If I go over there,
Marutamachi might not be too happy.
Maru? Why?
I don't know.
Ever since the festival, it's like she won't even look me in the eye.
Oh, it takes her a while to warm up to people.
I've never had any friends who'd invite me along on trips.
I don't really know how to act.
Up till middle school, Maru didn't have any friends either.
It all started when Inari talked to her in class last year.
Hey, Marutamachi, you draw?
My dad draws manga!
Really?
Inari and I grew up together,
so from that point on, we sorta became a trio.
Now, Inari has her issues, but she can make friends with anyone.
And I think that's great.
Yeah...
Oh, uh, k-keep this under your hat, okay?
Got it.
I'll never be like Fushimi.

This log cabin's just adorable!
The windows! The ceiling!
The table! The loft!
The more I look, the cuter it gets!
It's perfect for us four!
Keiko, can we talk?
Yeah, yeah.
Things ain't so hot between those two, are they?
So you know!
Then let's work together to
G'night.
Kei... ko...
Wow, a TV!
Let's watch somethin'!
Um...
Yes?
I'll go get some drinks!
Oh, Sumizome
C'mon, Maru, let's just have fun like we always do, okay?
I mean, Sumizome came all this way with us...
Easy for you to say.
A girl like Sumizone's in a whole different world from someone like me.
Huh? I don't think that's true at all!
Everything I talk about is boring.
Um... Er...
Oh, Sumizome likes shoujo manga!
Why don't you talk about that?
I'm just gonna look like some creepy geek to her!
Why're you bein' so contrary?!
Ow! I'm not!
Ow!
And what's wrong with bein' a geek?
This is all your fault!
Huh?
Things only got all awkward when you brought her here!
It was better when it was just the three of us!
Maru, you blockhead!
Apparently Marutamachi likes manga.
We'd have plenty to talk about,
but I don't think she'd want to speak with me...

We meet again!
It's gotta be fate!
C'mon! Me and my built buds are puttin' on a buff BBQ!
A celebratory chargrill dedicated to the gods of bodybuildin'!
So much for deepenin' our friendships.
I get the feelin' it's just made things worse.
It's quite the predicament!
Muscle, muscle!
C'mon, right this way!
It's a manly mixer of the ripped, by the ripped, and for the ripped!
C'mon, yo! Let's go!
Miss Inari!
Got it!
Inari, konkon!
Change into Keiko!
H-Hey!
MuscleHuh?
Sumizome! Hey, Sumizome!
Th-The beast is back!
He's scarred for life.
Muscle buds, save me!
Hey, Sumizome, you o...
I-I was so frightened!
I'm so glad... to see you...
S-Sumizome's so sweet!
E-Everything's all right! I'm here!
Thank you...
Say, Sanjou...
Huh?
Do you, um...
Am I in the way of you three?
No way!
I told you, it's fine!
Maru'll understand, trust me!
Thanks. I-It's like...
you're not yourself, somehow.
That's... crazy... talk.
The tension is incredible!
Maru, you blockhead!
If upsetting Inari makes you cry, why'd you do it?
K-Keiko! You're awake?
Hard to sleep with all the noise you're makin'.
Here's our forecast for tomorrow morning.
National Forecast
The tropical cyclone will peter out as it moves northeast...
Sumizome's really worried.
She thinks you hate her.
I know it takes a while for you to warm up to people,
but isn't it too early to make up your mind about what kinda person Sumizome is?
But...
If you and Inari make friends with Sumizome...
I'll be the odd one out.
C'mon. You know better.
You know Inari'd never let that happen.
Have some faith in yourself!
If you can be friends with me, you can be friends with anybody!
I'm starvin'.
Good morning!
I'm sleepy.
Want some cookies?
What a pain.
I'll do it!
What? Sumizome's actually super nice!
Why have I been such a stick-in-the-mud?
Hey...
I'm so happy you came, Sanjou.
Sure, no prob. Hey, listen, about Maru...
Miss Inari, a question, if you don't mind...
You don't intend to go back to the cabin like that, do you?
Like what?
Wh-What is it, Sanjou?
I, er, um... gotta pee!
Let's get back to the cabin, then.
No, there oughta be some restrooms around here... One sec!
Sumizome!
Fushimi? But... what are you doing here?
I was out for a stroll when I ran into Keiko.
She said she was about ready to drop,
and that she'd meet us back at the cabin.
E-Everything's all right! I'm here!
I'm pretty beat, too.
Let's go back together.
I don't want to.
I can't face Sanjou now.
When she helped me earlier, I felt like we'd finally become friends.
It made me so happy.
But I was wrong. I misunderstood,
and now I'm embarrassed and hurt...
Miss Inari...
I just don't know how to interact with people.
I want to be friends with Marutamachi,
but I can't even talk with her.
I've got work, but you'll be fine on your own, right?
Yep, I will.
I'm glad you're such a responsible girl, Akemi.
I've been on my own all this time, with no one to turn to for advice.
I've kept my distance, built walls around myself...
I don't know what to do.
And what's more,
all Sanjou talks about... is you.
Sumizome...
I've been so envious of you lately. I'm an awful person.
Huh? Envious?
But I was the one who was envious of her.
I want to be Sumizome!
But that's no good!
Isn't there any way I can help her?
If there's anything I can do...
Anything!
I wish I were you, Fushimi!
What... is this?
Why am I here
Why am I here
if I don't know how to love
if I don't know how to love
I lived my life dreaming of salvation
I lived my life dreaming of salvation
I rode my bicycle home past endless willows
I rode my bicycle home past endless willows
and left my life to the vagaries of fate
and left my life to the vagaries of fate
The waves of life
The waves of life
break on the little things around me
break on the little things around me
Please be with me
Please be with me
You gave me the light
You gave me the light
You saved me
You saved me
Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha

See you next time!
