Ash marches onward toward Cinnabar Gym,
hoping to win his seventh badge, but along the way,
other challenges will play an important part in his training.
-Rhyhorn, I choose you. -Bulbasaur! I choose you!
-Bulbasaur! -Rhyhorn, Takedown now.
Pikachu.
-It feels like an earthquake. -Get out of its way.
Rhyhorn's Takedown move is like getting hit by a tank.
Bulbasaur, go! Leech Seed now!
Bulbasaur!
Bulbasaur!
-Oh, no. -That Rhyhorn must be at a high level.
-Bulba bulba. Bulbasaur. -
Bulbasaur bulba.
Aw, Bulbasaur, return.
Bulba! Bulbasaur saur.
What are you doing, Bulbasaur? Return.
Bulbasaur is determined not to give up the battle till it wins.
Ha-ha-ha! You must be a lousy trainer, kid.
It won't even listen to you.
Saur.
Pika!
You can do it, Bulbasaur! Razor Leaf!
Bulbasaur!
Bulbasaur!
-Oh, Rhyhorn! -All right!
You sure chopped me down to size, kid. Your Bulbasaur's great.
Thanks. Your Rhyhorn isn't so bad either.
Bulbasaur can never settle for being second best, can it, Ash?
All of Ash's Pokemon are really stubborn just like Ash is.
Chu?
That's the way to win, Bulbasaur. Huh?
Bulbasaur bulba.
Is something the matter, Bulbasaur? Are you feeling sick?
-Pikachu? -Oh!
- Bulbasaur! - Pika ka pika.
Something is really wrong with my Bulbasaur.
-I think it must be sick. -Hmm.
Bulba bulba.
I wonder if this Bulbasaur is...
Please, you got save it no matter what. Please, Nurse Joy.
I can't make any promises until I examine it,
but I'll do whatever I can.
It's got to be okay.
What's the matter, Togepi? Is something wrong? Huh?
It's happening. Now I'm positive.
Joy, is my Bulbasaur going to be okay?
You don't have to worry about your Bulbasaur, Ash.
It isn't sick at all. It's just getting ready to evolve.
Evolve? I can't believe it. Bulbasaur's going to evolve.
You shouldn't be surprised.
That mountain man said Bulbasaur was strong
and that's because you've done such a great job training it.
When Bulbasaur evolves, it'll turn into Ivysaur, right?
Right. So how long is it going to be till the big evolve-o-rama?
Let me see.
-Wow, just like last time. -What do you mean?
When they brought Bulbasaur into the center before,
I saw a vase of flowers burst into bloom.
-Hey, look. The flowers are sparkling. -Chu.
They say that at a certain time of the year,
Bulbasaur gather together from all over the world
for the festival where they evolve.
No one knows why they choose that time.
It's different every year,
but it seems to have something to do with the alignment of the planets
and the phases of the moon.
It sure is beautiful.
It looks like we got here at just the right time for the festival.
Where do the Bulbasaur go to evolve?
Have you ever heard of the Mysterious Garden?
The Mysterious Garden? Cool name.
Yes, but since no human being has ever seen the garden clearly.
Most people think it's nothing but an illusion.
Look at those flowers sparkle. That's not an illusion.
The Mysterious Garden must be someplace out there.
The Mysterious Garden, I want to see that.
-How about you, Pikachu? Want to see it? - Pika, pika.
Bulba.
Pika?
Pikachu.
Bulbasaur.
-Pika. -Bulba.
Pika Pika. Pikachu. Pika Pika.
Bulbasaur. Bulba. Bulbasaur-saur. Bulba Bulbasaur-saur.
-Pika, Pika. -Bulba, Bulbasaur.
Pikachu.
Bulba...
-Bulba! Ugh! -Pika, pika?
-Bulbasaur! - Pika, Pika.
Bulbasaur. Bulba. Bulbasaur. Bulba. Bulbasaur. Bulba. Bulba.
Pika! Pika!
Bulba!
Bulba! Bulba! Bulba! Bulba! Bulba!
- Pika. Pika! -Bulba!
-That makes a thousand badges. -Pika Pi! Pikachu!
-Hey, we're trying to sleep, Ash. -What's the matter, Pikachu?
Pika Pika! Pika.
You mean something happened to Bulbasaur?
Pika!
Um! Hey! Bulbasaur isn't in the room.
Pikachu, what happened? Do you know where it went?
Pikachu.
Oh, this place is dreamy.
It makes me feel just like a princess in a fairy tale.
I feel another sneeze coming. I hate this sparkly stuff.
-I have allergies. -And I'm allergic to your whining.
You both give me a rash. Quit your jabbering. We got a job to do.
Yes! We're going to get you, Pikachu.
And there ain't nothing to it but to do it.
-Woo, it's a Bulbasaur bonanza. -A Bulbasaur blow-out.
A breathtaking Bulbasaur bargain bazaar.
And they're all ours.
Bulbasaur!
Our Bulbasaur bonanza went bust.
Looks like Team Rocket's...
Blasting off again.
Which way, Pikachu?
-Pika. -Hurry!
Ouch. Those Bulbasaur are going to pay for this.
We won't take this lying down.
This way. Follow that stream of pollen.
It should lead us straight to Bulbasaur.
We must be near the mysterious garden.
Ah! What's that?
This whole forest is going crazy. Huh?
Look, those vines are trying to block our way.
There's no way a bunch of stupid vines are going to stop me from rescuing Bulbasaur.
Dive through!
Oh, that was a close one.
Ugh. Now I'm beginning to understand
why nobody's seen the Mysterious Garden before.
There's only one way to go now, into the garden.
- Pika! -What is it, Pikachu?
Wow, this must be the Mysterious Garden.
Bulba! Bulba! Bulbasaur! Bulba! Bulba! Bulbasaur!
Bulba! Bulba! Bulbasaur! Bulba! Bulba! Bulbasaur!
Bulba! Bulba! Bulbasaur! Bulba! Bulba! Bulbasaur!
Bulba! Bulba! Bulbasaur! Bulba...
-Wow! That's neat. -Oh, it's so pretty.
What's that banging sound?
Saur!
-Look, you guys, it's a Venusaur. -It's giant.
Venusaur, the final form of the Bulbasaur evolution.
This seed Pokemon soaks up the sun's rays as a source of energy.
Hmm, but that kind of behavior makes it sound like a plant.
I don't see my Bulbasaur anyplace around here.
Hey, Ash, your Bulbasaur still has that bandage on its head.
-Hmm. -Ka!
Hey, there it is. Over here, Bulba... Urgh.
Hey, don't forget human beings aren't supposed to be here.
-Oh, right. -Let's watch the festival.
-Saur! - Saur
-Saur! - Saur
-Saur! - Saur
-Saur! - Saur
-Saur! - Saur
Bulbasaur.
-Saur! - Saur
-Saur! - Saur
How do we get in there?
Why doesn't Meowth just scratch his way through with his claws?
I just filed them.
-All right, garden wall, you axed for it. -We're the toughest team you ever saw.
Let's cut to the chase.
A timber-tantrum, eh? Let's get to the root of its problem.
I think its bite is as bad as its bark.
-Ivysaur. -All right.
The seed Pokemon Ivysaur.
Bulbasaur's evolved form.
The bulb on its back absorbs nourishment and blooms into a large flower.
-Saur! - Saur
-Saur! - Saur
This must be their evolution festival.
For a long time, people have disagreed
whether Bulbasaur is an animal type Pokemon or a plant type.
If either plants or animals disappeared from the planet, life wouldn't go on.
They need each other to live and grow.
Pika.
Maybe the Bulbasaur are a sign that all life on earth is connected.
Maybe you're right.
I wonder if my Bulbasaur's going to evolve too.
-Ah! -Huh?
Hmm, it's not evolving.
- - Why not?
it looks like it's trying not to evolve.
Pika.
Venus... Venusaur.
-Venusaur. -Bulba.
-Venus. Venusaur. -Bulba. Bulbasaur.
Venusaur. Venusaur. Venusaur.
Bulbasaur. Bulba. Bulba. Bulbasaur. Saur.
Venusaur. Venusaur!
Venusaur.
Bulbasaur.
The others are getting really angry at Bulbasaur.
I wonder why.
Bulbasaur's even more stubborn than you.
-Venusaur! -Bulba!
-Hey! -Pika!
-Leave it alone. -Pika.
-Pika Pik! -Bulbasaur!
-Ash. -Are you okay?
-Ven... -Asaur.
-Are they mad at us too? -I don't think they're too thrilled.
Venusaur.
Sorry we broke in on your festival
but the Bulbasaur you're angry at is my friend.
The reason you're so mad is because it doesn't want to evolve, right?
Venusaur!
You probably feel like it ruined your festival and I'm very sorry about that.
But if Bulbasaur doesn't want to evolve yet,
I don't think you should have right to force it to.
Venusaur!
Whoa, they're manipulating nature.
If Bulbasaur evolves, it could do that too.
Don't you want to have that kind of power, Bulbasaur?
Bulba.
Sorry I got so excited about you evolving
without even thinking about whether you wanted to do it or not.
Bulbasaur.
Now, look, you can't just force Bulbasaur to do what you want.
Bulbasaur has a right to decide when it's ready to evolve.
- The pest is right. -Saur?
You've got to choose your own path.
And when our path to the Mysterious Garden was blocked...
We decided to rise above it all.
And we provide our own hot air.
Now we'll have to prepare for trouble.
- Prepare for trouble. - Make it double.
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie. -James.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Stop wasting time. Start the machine up.
-We need the motto. -Our fans have come to expect it.
Let's get started.
Here we go... again.
-Hit it. -Suction on.
Bulbasaur!
-It's a vacuum! -No kidding!
-It's really working. -It's a suck-cess.
Saur! Bulbasaur!
It's trying to save them.
-Turn up the suction full-power. -Roger.
Venusaur!
Pikachu, use your thunder to bring down their balloon.
-Pika. -No, wait!
A thunder attack might hurt the Ivysaur that Team Rocket captured.
-We got to do something. -Pika!
-Ah! Pikachu! -Pika!
-Saur! -Pika Pi! Pi, pika, ka.
- Pikachu! -Pika pi.
Thanks, Bulbasaur.
Try to let the air out of their balloon with your Razor Leaf attack.
Bulbasaur!
-Oh! -Bulba.
Venus.
All that's left is a puny, little Bulbasaur. Should we get it?
A Bulbasaur? Ha, ha.
Who needs a Bulbasaur?
Bulba!
-What a wimp. - You can keep that runt.
Hey, stop making fun of my Bulbasaur.
Bulba! Bulba!
What's that?
Solarbeam, Bulbasaur's strongest attack.
Light is collected and formed into a powerful beam with intensive force.
Like a super strong sunbeam. I didn't know you could do that.
Bulba.
Okay, Bulbasaur, get ready to use your Solarbeam.
-Pika! -Bulbasaur! Bulbasaur! Bulbasaur!
Fire the Solarbeam!
Bulba!
Smoking.
Bulba!
Bulbasaur! Bulbasaur! Bulbasaur! Bulbasaur! Bulbasaur! Bulbasaur...
Venusaur.
Bulbasaur.
-Things look bad. -Oh, they're about to get worse.
Saur!
-Saur! -Saur!
Team Rocket's blasting off again.
-Great job, Bulbasaur. -Bulbasaur.
-That was amazing. -You're the greatest.
Uh-oh.
Venusaur.
Bulba.
Bulbasaur.
-I guess Venusaur finally understands. -I think you're right.
Pikachu.
Hey. The Mysterious Garden.
After the evolution festival, it must disappear.
Yeah, I'm sure glad we were here to see it.
Goodbye, Venusaur and Ivysaur.
- I hope we see you again. - See you later.
-Bulbasaur. -Pikachu.
And so Ash and his friends leave the incredible Mysterious Garden.
No one knows if or when Bulbasaur will finally decide to evolve.
No one, that is, except Bulbasaur.
Bulbasaur.
