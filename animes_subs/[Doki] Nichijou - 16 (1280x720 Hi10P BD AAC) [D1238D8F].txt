Hey!
( !)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
All right! I'll say it!
You are my best, best friend!
(Fly!) When I joke around a bit,
(Shine!) You joke around more in response.
(La La La) Nothing is better than this!
(Why!) Even if something bad happens,
(Fine!) I immediately forget about it!
(La La La)
Always keep it going!
Being together 24 hours a day isn't a problem.
Just like twins, or a parent and child, or clone cyborgs.
Then isn't there no reason to clear your eyes?
Those are completely, completely different issues.
(Fight!) Even when I get in a fight with you,
(Down!) even when I get really down,
(Shy!) even when I feel like I want to be alone,
before I realise it, you're right there; we'll be together even in death!
I wonder why it is.
I want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
time goes 100 times faster!
It's fun, isn't it?
It's way too fun!
As expected of my best friend!
What is it?
The synchro is amazing!
Always making an uproar,
bothering the neighbours a lot.
What time is it now?
And then yo de le hi hoo!
I don't get it at all!
So re doh si la!
It's better than I imagined, the absolute best!
Even if I say this and that, we're still friends. (Hooray!)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
Cha Cha La Cha La Cha Cha!
Let's all sing together
Unite our hearts as one
In times of sadness,
and times of pain,
Let's all sing together
Let your voice out loud
Don't be shy
Let's sing
A song that ignites your heart
A song that will surely make it to you
Out across the glistening world,
I am sending a song
Out across the glistening world,
I hope my message of love reaches.

Narration
Well, that's all for today.
The days are getting shorter,
so please try to be home before it gets dark.
Nano-chan!
Yes?!
Let's go home together.
Do you want to stop by that place near the station?
Eh?
What do you think?
Um... Uh...
Hey, Mio-chan. Do you want to come, to -
Huh?
Did she leave already?
Then, Nano -
Huh?
I ended up running away.
That wasn't very nice to Aioi-san.
If only I could've introduced myself more like a normal girl...
My name is Shinonome Nano!
And you see, this key is...
A local cafe had been renovated, so I tried going in.
Um...
What would you like to order?
An espresso T.
So, would you like a tall espresso?
Tall?!
Tooru?!
T is for tall?!
Well, I feel like having a tall espresso.
I'll have a small-sized T. espresso, then.
Do you want a short espresso?
A small short is fine.
All right.
Okay, an espresso...
Um... Hot or iced...?
I'll have it hot.
Um, well...
For a hot...
The sizes are...
Solo or... doppio.
D-Doppio?!
Doppio?!
What the heck is doppio?! Doppio, doppio!
What the heck is doppio?! What the heck?!
Oh, that's right. I forgot.
I think I'll get the coffee of the day.
Um...
Today's is espresso.
All right, I'll get that.
Well, then...
Solo...
Or doppio?
Or doppio, doppio, doppio?
That makes sense...
W-Well, then...
I'll leave it up to you.
Understood.
Sorry for the wait.
Here's your espresso.
It's tiny.
And it's really bitter!
Thank you for your business!
Well, I guess...
I gave a baseball glove to my grandson, Mii-chan, for his birthday.
Grandpa! I'm throwing it!
Hey, Mii-chan.
If you stand that far away, you won't be able to throw it over here.
My grandson is really cute, being this delighted...
Here it comes!
All right. Throw it with all your strength.
I should act cool for him tod -
Is he a pro?
Um...
Yes?
I'd like one of those Agonising!,
piping hot chicken bars made on the chef's whim.
Miss, give me a break!
What is it, Kojirou?
That's right.
I have to hurry.
They'll close -
Mio-chan!
Y-Yukko, what's up?
Well, you disappeared right after class ended.
Oh, I see.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
Let's go home together.
Well, sorry, I have some business to attend to.
Oh? What is it?
Uh, well, you see...
What's with that pompous style of speech?
Well, how should I say it...
What's wrong with it?
Could I have a moment?
I'm sorry!
Hey, Yukko!
What have you done?!
I just apologised without thinking!
Well, that surprised me, too.
You suddenly apologised to me.
I'm sorry.
So, what did you want?
Well, lately, there have been cases of counterfeit bills being used on vending machines.
I was just wondering if you'd seen anyone suspicious around.
Well, Mio-chan?
I don't visit this area often.
According to witnesses,
the culprit has a beige bag with red lines on it.
There's no way that cou -
What's that conspicuous reaction for?!
Does she have some?
Does she have counterfeit bills?
No, there's no way...
Man, stop joking around, Mi -
Why is she preparing to be handcuffed?!
Hey, do you have some counterfeit bills?
Of course not!
She's just preparing to hit a volleyball.
Right, Mio-chan?
Well, whatever.
Let me check inside your bags, just in case.
Go right ahead.
Come on, Mio-cha -
She took it out!
She took out a counterfeit bill!
It's over!
I can't believe she actually had one!
Please let me off with this.
Please let me off with this!
Is this the only counterfeit bill you have?
It's not a counterfeit!
It's a real bribe!
I don't understand what you're saying!
Just give me your bag!
Why are you resisting?!
It belongs to a relative!
It's because this bag belongs to a relative!
Idiot.
One! Two! Three! Four! Five!
Six?!
Passion.
Fever. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
What happened?! A crime?!
Oh, Kojirou. There you are.
You look like you were just born.
Mio!
Aren't you going to eat?
It'll get cold!
Hey, Mio!
Hey!
Kojirou is like this.
What are you -
Well, that's all for today.
I've put up the topics for the midterm, so please go and check them.
Goodbye!
Nano-chan always leaves really early.
Goodbye.
If I have a weakness, I think I'll pretend to know about it.
Yukko, may I borrow an eraser?
All right.
Which one?
Mai-chan, may I borrow an eraser?
Wow!
Okay.
A character eraser?!
This won't erase very well.
Yukko, let me borrow an eraser.
You don't have one either, Mai-chan?
I guess I have no choice.
All right, which one?
This one.
Wow!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
The rule is one person at a time, so that doesn't count!
When did that rule get set?
All right, Mai-chan goes first.
Go ahead, look as closely as you want.
No, no!
Damaging attacks aren't allowed!
Mai-chan, you get 1-P.
1-P?
One penalty.
Does something happen if you get one penalty?
You have to treat me to 23 juices!
She still has a grudge about that?
Here, Yukko.
Baby Star.
Kan ji zai bo sa tsu gyou jin han nya ha ra mit ta ji shou kei go...
TL Note: Yukko is reciting the first part of the Hart Sutra, a Zen Buddhist chant.
That was close!
My hand was about to open!
It's shou ken go, not shou kei go.
I thought it would work.
That's two penalties.
Rock, paper, scissors.
How naive.
Of course I won't open the hand I'm holding it with.
This one.
Oh, crap!
I've been played!
Well then, Yukko, give me your eraser.
All right, all right.
Here, you win.
Character erasers doing wrestling moves?!
Thank you for your business!
The character erasers didn't work after all.
Right?
It's Nano-chan.
It is.
Nano-chan must be a robot after all.
Stop that.
Nano-chan doesn't like it.
Huh?
Why doesn't she like it?
Robots are amazing!
Hey.
Let's run.
Father.
Hey, Father!
Do you really go out into town wearing this?
It embarrasses me!
Embarrasses you?
You cowardly child!
Um... Shinonome... Shinonome...
Oh, here it is.
Shinonome Institute...
Wow!
It's an institute?
Cool!
Excuse me!
Huh?
Are they out?
Yes, I'm coming!
Sorry for making you wai -
W-What should I do?!
Why did Aioi-san come to my house?!
If she meets the Professor, she'll definitely find out that I'm a robot!
What should I do?
But wait,
maybe she just came over to give me a printout from school.
If that's the case, she doesn't need to -
Coming!
Oh, good day.
Huh? Where's Nano-chan?
Hooray! Come in! Come in!
I'm coming in.
This way.
Thank you.
I can't help that she came inside.
I'll just have to find out what she wants before the Professor says any -
I'm hung -
I'm hung -
I'm hung -
What was that voice?
That's our cat, Sakamoto.
He talks.
Professor!
Really?!
Of course not!
Sakamoto-san, say meow!
It's meow, Sakamoto-san.
M-Meow.
See?
Just a regular cat.
Sakamoto-san...
What was that?
Scary!
Meow.
I haven't introduced myself, have I?
I'm Aioi Yuuko.
Are you Nano-chan's younger sister?
No, I'm the Professor.
I created Nano.
Created?!
Amazing!
You're so small, but amazing!
Professor is a professor, after all.
No, Aioi-san!
She's the child of a relative of mine,
and they both work and don't come home until late, so I watch over her.
Right?
Isn't that right?
What are you saying?
Stupid!
I'm sorry.
I'll go make some more tea.
Oh, wait a minute, Nano.
If you want tea...
Go ahead.
Amazing! Amazing!
This one is a gun.
Cool!
Super cool!
I'm finished!
Next, we'll have a cool line competition!
Yay!
I'll start!
You're just joking, right?
Wake up!
Wake up, I said!
Oh! Cool!
Your turn, Professor!
What a pain!
Cool!
What did Aioi-san come here for?
They're on top of each other!
I give! I give!
So small!
So big!
Well, I should go.
She had no reason?!
Thank you for today.
Sorry for staying so long.
It's fine.
Um, Aioi-san!
Hm?
I'm actually studying magic, so, um,
I'm definitely not a robot or any -
Yeah, I know.
You're not a robot, Nano-chan.
You're Nano-chan.
Isn't that enough?
I came over today to say that.
I'd forgotten.
Well, bye.
Yeah.
Aioi-san!
Um...
If you'd like...
Yeah!
I'll come back!
Really?!
Hooray!
Let's draw pictures next time!
Yeah! I'll draw sharks!
Sharks, huh? Those are cool!
They are cool!
I love them!
You like sharks, huh, Professor?
I love sharks!
They're so cool!
Professor!
Let me join, too!
Oh, it's Sakamoto.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, whatever.
Plus screw sounds neat, doesn't it?
TL Note: Plus is what Japanese call Phillips-heads.
It has a positive feeling.
It somehow makes you feel optimistic.
Next episode of Nichijou is episode 17.
Look forward to it!
