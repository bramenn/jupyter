The Grand Magic Games elimination round! Sky Labyrinth...
Begin!
If this is a race, we better hurry up.
Yeah!
Wait!
What?!
He said all five members of the team have to reach the goal together.
Wendy isn't back yet.
Oh, that's right!
Wendy!
Then what are we gonna do?!
Even with Wendy gone, you got a Man right here.
Member change!
What superhuman strength!
Elf-nii-chan!
Guess we got no choice. I don't think we have time to wait for Wendy!
We're in your hands, Elfman!
Leave it to me!
Lisanna! Happy!
What is it, Erza?!
Search for Wendy and Carla!
I just hope they haven't got into any trouble...
Okay! I'll talk to our people!
Good luck, everyone!
Man!
There's the entrance to the labyrinth!
Nope! There's the entrance to being number one in Fiore!
Let's go, Team Fairy Tail!
Yeah!
Sky Labyrinth!
Let's begin with an explanation of the elimination round's rules.
This time around, there are 113 teams strong participating in the Grand Magic Games.
The purpose of this elimination round is to cut down
that number all at once to eight teams who will compete in the Games proper.
The rules are simple.
All of the teams must go from their inn to Sky Labyrinth
and make it from there to Domus Flau, the Games arena.
The eight teams that arrive first survive the elimination round
and will compete in the Games.
Furthermore, contestants are free to use magic to get through the maze,
and there are no restrictions.
However...
The Grand Magic Games executive committee assumes no responsibility!
So it's a three-dimensional maze in here...
I'm not good with stuff like this!
Get it together!
If we're not one of the first eight teams to arrive,
forget about number one in Fiore, because we'll be cut!
Yeah, right?!
We gotta get through here an' beat those Sabertooth bastards to a pulp!
Let's get to the goal before they do!
A Man finishes the elimination round in first place!
Basically, we should head east.
The arena is in that direction.
In that case, count on me!
Open! Gate of the Compass!
Pyxis!
Please, Pyxis! Tell us which way is east!
That way is east!
Sorry, Lucy.
I brought along a compass.
Pyxis... Good job.
Let's head east!
A Man charges straight through!
Be that as it may, we can't just go straight east, can we?
Not the way this is constructed...
Is the roof folded back over?!
You're doing okay?
Yeah. I don't know why, but I'm not feelin' sick at all.
I'll explain!
For the elimination round, this entire Sky Labyrinth has been treated with magic
so even those with motion sickness or fear of heights can compete fairly!
So it's like a Troia.
Maybe that means Natsu isn't the only wizard with motion sickness!
That's just pathetic.
I can hear you two!
Anyway, let's keep going east!
Right!
What the hell is this?!
Just lookin' at it is making me dizzy!
I can't tell if that end is above or below!
Whichever! Let's go!
A Man doesn't hesitate, but charges ahead!
Still, how far does this thing go?
Don't worry about it!
At the end of it'll be the goal! Hey!
Get a hold of yourself!
What the hell's goin' on here?!
Like the name says, it's a labyrinth.
That reminds me of what he said about not taking responsibility even if people die...
Falling from here, we'd end up on the street in Crocus, headfirst.
Then we're supposed to choose our path carefully, huh?
We ain't gonna get to the goal by inspecting this whole place!
Let's just look around to the east!
I think it'd be a good idea to take notes as we go.
Notes?
Like how we've gotten here from the starting point...
What kind of places we've passed...
If we can't get a grip on where we are right now, we won't be able to make progress easily.
Yeah, we can't just complain about it.
I see. She's talking about mapping the place.
Taking notes?!
I don't know one place from another!
Can't you get a whiff of the goal or something, Natsu?
My nose isn't working.
Maybe that's due to the magic cast in this labyrinth...
Every team has the same conditions.
Anyway, let's keep going!
Wendy-nee isn't with them?!
Isn't with them... You mean she's missing?
Carla isn't there either!
But the rule is there has to be five people!
So Natsu-nii and the rest will...
Elf-nii-chan suddenly filled in for her.
Elfman's in the elimination round?
Seriously?!
If I'd been there, maybe I would've been able to be in the elimination round, too!
Uh, look...
The point is, we have to look for those two!
Romeo and Nabu, spread the word.
If we split up into teams and stay in contact through Warren...
Even so, this is a huge city...
Got it!
I just hope they haven't gotten caught up in some kind of trouble...
First, let's get back to the rest of the gang.
I'm worried, but we have to make an efficient search for them.
Yeah...
East is that way!
It's hard taking notes on this maze.
Yeah,'cause every inch has distinctive features...
Hey! Erza...
Yeah. I heard something, too.
You're the one that said it's this way!
What, it's my fault?!
Not that I care, but we've already been this way once.
Right?! I knew it!
Anyway, we gotta keep goin' or we'll run out of time!
Come to think of it...
The guys from the other guilds are in here, too, right?
Hey. Are you serious?!
That mug...
Fairy Tail!
Unbelievable!
Those guys!
This guild is Twilight Ogre.
When Natsu and the others came back home from Tenroujima after seven years,
this is the guild that threatened Fairy Tail.
With Natsu and the rest back in action, the guild really put the hurt on them, but...
As always, they're a piss-poor lookin' guild!
Lame-o's!
I didn't expect you guys to be participating, too.
I could say the same to you.
You're the one who's in the guild that's perpetually last.
This year's Fairy Tail is different!
How so?!
Hey, wait a second! Are we gonna fight here?!
We're free to use magic in here! There are no restrictions!
We'll crush you right here!
These dopes don't learn.
I'm fired up!
We're seriously gonna battle?!
The less rivals there are, the better.
Well, sure, but...
Who would've guessed we'd run into'em this quickly?!
Get'em!
I'm gonna pay'em back every bit for that last time!
We got our eyes on...
That and bein' number one in Fiore!
You're in our way!
What the...?!
Hey-hey-hey-hey!
What is this?!
The floor... No, this is...
The entire labyrinth is rotating!
What?!
The entire labyrinth is rotating!
R-Rotating?!
What's that about?!
What the heck is that?!
Hey, don't tell me...
Lisanna, look!
Oh, no! People are falling!
You're disqualified if you're outside the zone, right?
I hope Natsu is okay...
It's rotating on a Z-axis!
Everyone, move to the flank!
I'm already falling!
If only Happy were here...!
You don't need Happy!
You've got a Man here.
N-Nice catch!
Thanks, Elfman!
It was nothin'!
Are you guys okay?!
Yeah!
It's stopped.
But this is seriously screwed up. What kind of contraption is this?
Remember, the idea is to take over 100 teams and narrow them down to eight.
This is a logical way.
And lots of teams were just shaken right off...
Maybe I'll just quit...
What is this? A map?!
Looks like it...
That's a stroke of luck!
If we combine it with our notes, it'll be an even more accurate map!
Hey! That's...
It's yours?
G-Give it back!
I refuse.
You are disqualified.
I see...
I'm starting to get an idea of how this elimination round works...
Everyone, your eyes are scary!
The elimination round has revved up into high gear at last.
And from here on in, it's gonna get even crazier!
We'll pare down those teams like nobody's business!
Then there's only one thing to do!
Steal maps from the other teams!
This is more of a battle than a race!
It's a Man's scramble for maps!
If it's a battle, that's right up our alley!
I'm taking this!
By all means!
Okay, this makes the sixth one!
I have no idea how to read this map!
Lucy's good at stuff like that.
Then let's bring all the maps together and have Lucy decipher'em!
Me?!
If you would.
Sure.
Give us...
I got three more teams' worth!
I've got seven teams' worth!
I'm sorry...
How cruel...
It's movin' again!
Hang on to something!
It stopped.
Alright! Let's get back to our map quest!
Max! Did you find out anything?!
No. There's the lateness of the hour for one thing, and no relevant info at all out there...
I know, right?
Where the heck did you go, Wendy?!
We need to hurry up and find her so Natsu and the rest can focus on the elimination round.
Well, Warren?
We're coming up clueless.
I think we've searched most of Crocus,
and I can't imagine she would be in Domus Flau...
About all that leaves is the palace...
Now that you mention it...
What is it?
Carla said she was going to sightseeing spots with Wendy...
Then... you don't think... they could be in the palace?
Let's check it out!
Yeah!
Hmm... It's rotated around a bunch of times,
so I thought even if we kept heading for the maze's east side, it would waste a lot of time.
So that's why we came to the center part of the labyrinth, huh?
I figured doing that would make it easy for us to locate east...
And upside down on top of that...
The problem is there is no east or west here.
Even the compass has gotten dizzy.
Then we don't know which way to go...
But we can't afford to stand around either.
I was waiting for a time like this!
What are you going on about?
Is your head spinning too, Lucy?
No!
Open! Gate of the Compass! Pyxis!
That's the one from before...
It's scared of somethin'.
It's traumatized by Erza's compass.
It's my fault?!
Pyxis, this is your time to shine!
A compass is useless now!
Look. It just spins around.
Come on, we need your power!
I apologize for before. Will you help us?
It's got a weak mind, huh?
Can you blame it, goin' up against Erza?
Did you say something?!
Nope! Not a word!
East is that way!
That way... You mean up?!
You sure about this?!
Yeah! The power of a Celestial Spirit is way stronger than just some compass!
How are we supposed to climb up there?!
It's obvious, isn't it?
This.
That's what you meant?!
There are birds...
This is a peaceful place.
I've been tossed around every which way,
but I can't stand the idea of failing this elimination round now.
What are you lying around for? We're still in a race.
Hurry! Let's aim for first place in this round!
Yeah!
Man!
Yeesh! What the hell is this?! Now it's the sea?!
How far does this go?!
Calm down and look carefully!
That sky is a fake. It's painted onto a wall!
Then...
Alright! Last spurt!
Yeah!
This is the palace of the king of Fiore?
The Flower Light Palace, Mercurius...
This is my first time seeing it.
Me too!
Hey, you two!
What are you doing here at this time of night?!
Excuse me.
Actually, someone from our guild who was meant to participate in the elimination round
of the Grand Magic Games has gone missing.
We looked all over Crocus. This is the last place we haven't checked.
Hey!
R-Right...
His Majesty is also looking forward to the Grand Magic Games...
You can look in the courtyard.
We can go in?!
What'd you say?! Are you serious?!
Is something wrong?
Happy and Lisanna just went into the palace!
I've never even been in there!
I'm surprised they let us in, you know?
The garden is open to the public for sightseeing.
Let's split up here.
Got it. If anything happens, relay it to Warren.
Aye, sir!
Roger! We're on our way to Mercurius right now!
I just hope they're safe...
Trouble from the elimination round already? I can tell this is going to be hard going...
Elfman Strauss!
Erza Scarlet!
Gray Fullbuster!
Lucy Heartfilia!
Natsu Dragneel...
Congratulations! You passed the elimination round!
Well, of course. It went smooth as silk.
Are we in first place?!
No. Eighth.
You barely made it.
What?!
So, our eight teams are all present!
Sky Labyrinth, the elimination round of the Grand Magic Games, is over!
How did Natsu and the rest do?!
Which guilds are going on to the real Games?!
Which guilds are going to participate in the real Games?
You'll find out at the opening ceremony!
Why not tell us now?! Miser!
I see! The elimination round is already finished.
Happy! Is something wrong?
Th-That...
No... It can't be...
Wendy's bag...
Where's Carla? Where's Wendy?
Calm down. Let's look for them around here.
Right.
Come on!
Aye!
What's that?! You found them?!
Are they okay?!
Actually, they're both unconscious!
Hurry up and call someone, Warren!
Caral! It's me! Wake up!
It doesn't look like she's injured,
but it's strange... I hardly sense any magic power from Wendy.
It's the same with Carla! What should we do?!
She's awake!
Wendy! What happened?!
No!
Wendy, it's me! It's Lisanna! Do you remember me?!
I'm here, too!
Happy... Lisanna-san...
What happened...
You tell us! What happened?!
We were...
The elimination round of the Grand Magic Games...
Elfman stepped up in place of Wendy.
Natsu and the rest barely managed to make it through the round.
And...
What will become
of Team Natsu's battle to dethrone Sabertooth and become Fiore's number one guild?
The elimination round of the Grand Magic Games! You came in last, huh?
There's gotta be some mistake.
You came in last.
Oh, shut up! We passed it and that's all that matters, right?
Now we just gotta take down places one through seven all at once!
All at once?
There are five people on a team and eight teams total, right?
Um... So we just gotta beat 40 people!
Next time: New Guild!
I'm impressed you can multiply,
but according to your calculation, you'll be fighting yourself, too!
Then make it 39 people!
Then you'll be fighting your... Oh, never mind.
