She should be at the temple at this hour.
The line to see the Lady Cleric is here.
Please have your ticket in hand.
Man, I feel alive again!
My body feels so much lighter.
Looks like she's working hard again today. Hopefully not too hard.
I believe there is.
If we find a cleric who can exorcise evil...
But she rarely takes on jobs to remove curse-based skills.
There may be some reason behind it,
but I'm her best friend, and she won't even tell me.
Lady Cleric...
I'm taking a break.
I apologize, but please wait.
Understood.
Oh, whoops...
I seem to be out of energy.
It appears as though you're working too hard, Lady Cleric.
Oh, it's you, Lola.
That's quite the greeting for someone who's worried about you.
I apologize.
So what's the very capable receptionist from the guild doing here today?
I hate to ask this when I know you're tired,
but I needed to discuss something important with you.
Today's the day that Lola is going to introduce us to this cleric.
I had some time before we were supposed to meet up,
so I decided to get some advice from my master.
Hidden dungeon only I can enter!
Let me train in secret to become the strongest in the world!
Hmph.
Hmphity hmph.
M-Master?
Are you mad about something?
Well, you haven't come see me at all!
I feel like it's been about two weeks.
S-Sorry about that!
I meant to come sooner,
but I ran into a little problem.
I see. A duke's daughter with a curse.
Yes.
If it's a curse-based skill, it might have to do with her family.
Her family? You mean something to do with her ancestors?
Yeah, it happens all the time!
There's a skill to curse one's descendants.
But that's...
You'll need over 10,000 LP to Get Creative enough to create the skill to undo it.
It's probably best if you let that cleric girl handle it.
Right. That's what I plan on doing, but...
I wonder what the Lady Cleric is like.
If she has the skill to exorcise things, she's probably at least part elf.
An elf, huh?
You don't see them very often.
It's great to fulfill some of your desires with other species.
You'll get lots of extra LP with them!
What?!
You gotta go for the glory!
Wh-What are you
S-So, Master, what would you do to earn about 10,000 LP?
Oh, in my case... Here. I'll whisper it to you.
First...
Then you'll have 10,000 LP in no time!
Jeez, I'm kidding. You're so cute, Noir.
Sh-She's totally messing with me...
You probably won't be able to get 10,000 that quickly,
but I can teach you a skill that'll be super useful in gaining LP.
Really? That'll be great!
Okay! Let your awesome master Olivia fill you in on the deets.
Thank you!
And now, for those deets...
You'll get the best bang for your buck! This forbidden skill is...

Huh?
Whoops, sorry!

Eek!
No!
Damn, my luck just won't stop!
This is how effective Lucky Lecher is?
Buh-ling!
Th-This skill's amazing!
You're the best, Master.

But this is going to affect my life.
I just need to use Editor to tinker with it a bit.

Hey! What are you smirking about?!
I-I'm not!
You were totally staring at those other girls, too!
That must be Noir.
Noir, you doofus!
He's pretty cute.
Just my type, actually.
Uh, Luna? What's that supposed to mean?!
Oh, Lola.
And...
The Lady Cleric?
Sorry to keep you two waiting. This is...
Luna Heela. It's nice to meet you two.
L-Likewise.
N-Nice to meet you.
Yeah.
We've got reservations. We can talk there.
Her silky, smooth, silvery locks...
Look at her from behind...
Her tight but perky butt...
Then her long, slim legs...
My only advantage over her is my boobs!
I never should've let Noir meet her.
Uh, Emma? Come on, let's go.
Lola told me the basics.
So this person you want me to look at...
Miss Maria. She's the daughter of a duke.
So it's her.
I've actually looked at her before...
But I declined lifting her curse.
But why? Don't you have a skill to lift curses?
Yes, I do. With no problems.
But...
I can't lift the Sixteenth Year Death Curse.
I can't save her.
How's Maria currently doing?
She doesn't even have a week to live.
She suffers convulsions that pain her entire body.
Apparently, the intervals are getting shorter.
So her curse has progressed that far...
Luna, you don't need to feel responsible for this.
You save dozens of people every day.
That itself is an amazing feat.
It seems that Luna feels pretty responsible for this.
Maybe she does have some kind of secret.
Discerning Eye.

Erases curse skills.
However, the user's... lifespan is reduced?!
So when she lifts the curse, Luna's own lifespan is...
Here it comes! This is a huge load!
Elves live far longer than humans.
But apparently, even so, Miss Maria's curse is so powerful
that her lifespan can't cover it.
Noir...
Lead me to Miss Maria's home.
I will lift her curse.
B-But you just said you couldn't lift her curse.
Well...
Emma, Lola.
Could you leave us for a bit?
I'd like to talk to Luna in private.
Sorry this is so sudden.
I took a look at your stats with my skill.
If you cure Miss Maria, that means your life...
Stop! Don't say anymore!
But
She's at death's door, isn't she?
How could I possibly leave her alone knowing her life is at stake?
I want to save people.
Just like my mother would have done.
My mother was also a cleric.
Even though she knew that her lifespan was at stake,
she continued lifting curses.
She kept her chipping away at her own lifespan to save those who were suffering.
And now, she's no longer with us.
But...
I'm very proud of my mother.
Luna...
And because I am my mother's daughter,
I want to use this power for others...
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter.
There's trouble!
A wall collapsed! Someone help!
There's a child underneath!
He's terribly injured!
Hey, are you okay?
Hang in there!
W-We need to heal him immediately.
I wonder sometimes...
Why are we born into this world?
I still don't know the answer to that.
It's all right.
I'm sure you'll find that answer someday.
I guess you've already found yours, Luna.
Yes.
I can save lives and bring about so many smiles.
That is my mission!
Healing Shot!
Thank goodness!
Luna!
W-Wow...
I guess your cleric title isn't just for show.

Huh?! Luna?!
Are you... Huh?!

Oh, I knew it.
Luna's always like this.
Don't worry, she'll be awake in no time.
Mommy...
Don't worry, Mommy's right here. Come on, now, up you go.
I can't believe you saw that! Please just forget it!
Please! Please! I beg of you!
Hey, it's okay...
Yeah.
Now, let us proceed! Maria needs our help!
Onward!
B-But...
Y-You don't need to worry about me...
I'm not scared of... anything...
Luna, let's figure out another way.
Huh?
B-But why?
Your legs.
I-I just can't contain my excitement!
But you said you were scared of curses.
What? No way. Can't recall.
Bad Luna!
Just tell us the truth already.
You're scared, aren't you?
If I save Maria, it's very likely that I'm going to...
die.
Just thinking about that is terrifying.
I'm a failure as a cleric.
You'll die if you lift a curse?
You never told me that before!
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. But I...
Huh...
So I've been hanging out with you this whole time
without realizing something that important.
N-No!
Some best friend! It pisses me off!
I'm so mad that I was so clueless.
Huh?
I'm sorry I didn't realize how much you were suffering.
You're always like this, Luna!
You always put others before yourself!
Lola...
Rely on me... Please.
Stupid Luna...
Okay.
Lola... Luna...
There's something great about these two.
Sorry about all this.
You ended up witnessing such an embarrassing scene.
Oh, no. It was a feast for my eyes.
Er, I was very moved by you two.
But what should we do?
If we try to save Miss Maria, then Luna will...
Don't worry.
Things aren't completely hopeless yet.
I'll be able to make this work without any casualties.
Earlier, I just gave it a shot, and took a look at Luna's Lift Curse skill.
Erases curse skills.
However, the user's lifespan is reduced in
proportion to the strength of the curse.
I tried to get rid of the whole lifespan is reduced part, but...

Making money and satisfying worldly desires...
And doing exciting things with attractive members of the opposite sex...
Y-Yeah.
I can't use my Get Creative or Editor skills without LP.
You know, you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs...
A-Anyway! Can you think of a way for me to get 2,000 more LP?
And maybe something that'll increase Luna's finances.
You make it sound so easy.
I highly doubt there's anything that convenient.
But there is.
Huh?!
A certain noble holds the perfect event for this occasion every week.
The next time it will be held is this weekend,
so we'll make it just in time to lift the curse.
What kind of event is it?
It's called...
It's called...?
The Harem Pride Event!
Sorry to keep you waiting, my dudes!
Tonight, another ten that I'm jealous of... I mean...
We'll be meeting some reckless scoundrels who'll be showing off their hot girlfriends
for a chance at one million rels!
Unforgivable!
Boo!
Those lucky bastards!
Piss off!
So vent all the stress you can at the sight of these shitty normies!
Apparently, the host of this event has been betrayed by women countless times.
And the gentlemen who have gathered here have experienced something similar.
Most of them, apparently, don't have any lovers.
Death to hot guys!
Screw harems!
Harems are unforgivable!
Th-This isn't a pride event... This is slander.
Are you ready, my dudes?
Let the Harem Pride Event commence!
I-I think I want to go home now...
