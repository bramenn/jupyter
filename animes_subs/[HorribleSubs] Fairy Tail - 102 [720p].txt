Aye, sir!
The S Class Wizard Advancement Exam has finally started!
Both Erza and Mira passed this exam to become S Class Wizards, didn't they?
I'm all fired up!
And the first test finished, but...
It was hard right off the bat.
So, what was the second test again?
It was searching for the founding Master, Mavis's grave.
But a weirdo went and barged in on us!
You're gettin' in the way of the exam, damn you!
By the way, Erza-san... What kind of magic does Mest-san use?
Ah yes, I suppose you aren't yet aware.
Mest uses... Uh, that! You know...
You don't know either, Erza-san?
What do you mean that Mest might not be a member of the guild?
It was just a hunch at first. But the strange thing is,
the more doubts I have, the more clear my knowledge of Mest becomes.
Huh? I don't follow you in the slightest.
It's unnatural.
The knowledge I have of him, even though I just joined the guild...
His name is Mest Gryder.
He is the disciple of Mystogan, the Prince.
He was chosen to take the S Class Exam last year, but unfortunately failed.
That's all.
Any other information on him is cloudy and vague...
See why I told her not to partner with that weirdo!
Anyway, we must hurry! Wendy might be in danger!
I've never seen this kind of flower before!
Mest-san, look!
I want to know! I want to know what these strange flowers taste like!
Please don't eat the flowers!
Hey, Natsu... Aren't we heading to the top?
I'd like to...
But I ain't gonna be satisfied until I give that bastard
who did this to Igneel's scarf a taste of my fist!
So... You're gonna search for the grave while also searching for that guy?
Just choose one or the other...
I'm gonna do both at once, geez!
That's Natsu for you, I guess.
What are you people after?
To hunt the fairies here!
Thundering Roar
Soul of Iron.
What a racket!
Magic from letters?
It's the same magic as yours!
Right, Levy?
That magic is Eastern Solid Script!
Gajeel!
Gajeel, hey!
He can't hear me?
Eggs?
Egg Buster!
Damn it... I can't hear his steps with all the noise!
Gajeel!
Solid Script: Silent!
The noise has gone back to normal!
Did your writing cancel out mine?
I heard that!
There!
Fire!
Zuzazazazazazaza
How dare you!
Slash
Supepepepepepe
Slash-Slash
Man... This is messed up...
Fire!
There's too many!
Levy!
He's cutting my iron scales like they're nothing?!
Go
Bi
Ba
Do
Za
Zan
Stab
Stab!
Kasha
Darkness Sword...
No!
Crying Bite!
Zan-zan-zan-zan-zan-zan-zan-zan-zan... Zan!
Jaki
Gajeel!
Gajeel...
If they're all as weak as these two,
I bet we can finish them all off before the main force arrives.
M-Main force, you say?
Looks like he's still alive-peron.
The main force is the full might of our Guild, Grimoire Heart!
B-But...
Levy, escape.
This isn't just some war.
It's gonna be way bigger than that.
But, I...
Go and tell everyone about this, on the double!
I can handle these chumps fine on my own!
You aren't getting away!
Gajeel!
What the hell are you doing? Hurry and go!
Iron?
Please, don't die.
Damn you... Letting that woman get away.
Whatever-peron... Just makes the hunt more fun-peron.
An all-out war against Fairy Tail, is it?
Y-You can stand?
Reminds me of back then...
I'll show you that picking a fight with Fairy Tail was a mistake!
Yeah...
You're gonna taste the same fear!
The full force of Grimoire Heart is coming to attack!
I don't know why...
But I have to tell everyone!
Something terrible is happening!
Gajeel...
Roar of the Iron Dragon!
Block
What the...
Fool, look above you!
Heavy Egg Rain!
Shubabababababa
You think my forged iron is going to lose to that rusty blade?!
Take this!
You're a pest!
Stab-stab-stab-stab
Stab!
You're open!
What?
I-I can't lose.
Damn you!
I can't lose, damn it!
Levy... Levy... Levy!
Where did you get those injuries?
Erza, Juvia...
What happened?
We've got trouble! Gajeel is...
Making an enemy of Fairy Tail...
These guys are the same as I was back then...
Gajeel was once part of another guild.
Its name was Phantom Lord.
They kidnapped Lucy, and drove Fairy Tail into a corner,
but were completely defeated and Phantom Lord was destroyed.
Their various wizards all set out and went their separate ways, but...
Yo!
Master Makarov!
What the hell are you here for?
Whoa there...
For a little talk.
Juvia entered my guild the other day.
She what?
Yeah, and she's pretty worried about you.
What the hell is that rain woman thinking?
What are you going to do now?
Beats me. I ain't decided.
Well, I'll get by somehow.
Can I ask you a question?
What?
What were you thinking when you picked a fight with us?
What did Phantom Lord mean to you?
What did the guild mean to you?
What did being a wizard mean to you?
That's more than one question.
They're all the same.
I'm asking what do you, yourself, think about who you are?
Would you have taken people's lives if Jose had ordered you to?
Are you that unquestioning?
You see, that's no different than being a puppet.
But I don't think you're as boring a man as that.
Shut up already. Leave me alone.
There's no need to throw yourself into the darkness.
How about it? Wanna join my guild?
You must be joking! Are you serious?!
There are people in this world who prefer solitude.
But there is no one who can withstand it.
I'm the one who destroyed your guild!
Let's put all that aside.
And... I hurt your friends...
That...
But if I ignored a young man trying to throw himself into the darkness,
it'd be myself I could never forgive.
This isn't me saving you. I'm simply showing you the path to tomorrow.
Will you go forward, or will you stop? It's up to you to decide.
I can't lose, damn it!
I'm a Fairy Tail...
My katana!
My soul!
Secret Dragon Slayer Art!
Hi
Iron God Sword!
Gajeel!
This is...
Gajeel-kun?
Gajeel! Hang in there, Gajeel!
I told you I could handle'em by myself...
Gajeel...
It's over!
The main force will be here any moment!
Wizards far out of my league are coming!
The Seven Kin of Purgatory!
Seven Kin?
I'm halting the exam.
All hands, deploy for battle!
Condition red! Prepare to intercept!
An enemy?
On this island? That's not good.
What's that?
A red signal...
An enemy.
What about the exam? Hey...
It's called off for now, with this.
Is it that guy from before?
That bastard!
I wonder... That's a signal that means an enemy is coming to attack.
They're closing in now.
I don't know who or what they are,
but they think they can pick a fight with us?
I'll turn the tables on'em!
Aye, sir!
Why now?
This is my final exam! Even though I wish to drop out of the guild...
You've got to be kidding me! I'm continuing the exam!
Cana...
Calm down, Cana.
Everyone feels the same way.
Gray! Loke!
Why are the two of you here?
We were foll...
We just happened upon you!
Anyway, who cares?
An enemy is coming... This is no time for exams.
Let's head to the emergency gathering area.
We don't have enough information now.
What's going to happen? Seriously...
Erza-san, what should we do now?
For now, let's search for Mest and Wendy.
It's possible they're lost and don't know where the camp is.
I'll take Gajeel to the camp.
Right, handle that.
A shrimp like you shouldn't push herself.
You sure talk big for a guy who can't stand up.
Man, this is messed up.
Juvia wants to see Gray-sama very soon!
Now then, let's hear what you're after.
You think I'd talk to the likes of you?
It's Zeref...
The legendary Black Wizard Zeref!
Zeref is here on this island!
Impossible!
Zeref lived hundreds of years ago...
400 years, yes.
I don't believe it! There's no way he's alive!
After all, Jellal...
He's alive! He's been alive these past 400 years!
But Master Hades says that he's currently sleeping.
I can't believe what you're saying.
When Zeref awakens,
this world will be bathed in pure darkness!
Don't be ridiculous! This is Fairy Tail holy ground!
You're telling me you plan to run rampant on this divinely protected Fairy island?!
Master Hade's personal guard will be here soon.
You'd do well not to underestimate the 7 Kin of Purgatory!
The wizard of time, Ultear!
Rustyrose!
Our boss, Caprico-sama!
Kain Hikaru!
Zancrow!
Meldy!
And the final one is already on this island...
Say what?
Mest-san, what does that signal flare mean again?
Um...
Huh?
I want to know! I seriously want to know!
You've forgotten too, Mest-san?
And besides, Mest-san... You really shouldn't try to put everything in your mouth.
This is bad... Should I make my move before the main forces come?
Wendy!
Carla! Lily?
Get away from him right away!
Mest! Who exactly are you?
Who am I?
I'm Mystogan's disciple, and...
Mystogan would not have taken on a disciple in this world.
You did well choosing to use a human who is no longer in this world,
but your cover story was too weak, Mest. If that's your real name.
Who are you?!
Whoa, whoa! A bunch of guys I dunno are comin' here!
That mark... Could they be Grimoire Heart?
Why would a Dark Guild be here?
Maybe this is also part of the S Class exam?
Like a big festival, testing our strength?
Pretty weird festival.
And wait, we've gone from exams to festivals?
Next time: Makarov's Charge.
Oh, it's not a festival!
Then I guess they're enemies.
That means I can blast'em, right?
But try not to get blasted yourself,'kay?
