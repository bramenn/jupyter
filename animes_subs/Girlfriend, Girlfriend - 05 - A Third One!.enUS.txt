Milika here!
In this video, I try walking in on three of my classmates in a relationship.
I thought about messing with them, but...
They found out I'm secretly a MeTuber!
I'm going to have to become this weirdo's girlfriend now!
I'll be your girlfriend, too!
What?
You? Become Naoya's girlfriend?
That's right.
I, Milika-sama, the heartbreakingly cute streamer, will be your third girlfriend.
Wh-What are you trying to do?
Um...
Maybe, now that her identity's out,
she wants a man to protect her from creepy stalkers and stuff.
N-N-N-N-N-N-No way!
She's so obvious!
Why would I ever ask anyone for help?
Um...
I j-just felt like it's time I had a boyfriend.
Such a sloppy lie.
Saki-chan...
She says that's not it, so that's not it.
How are you so gullible?!
Aren't you happy?
My long, slender legs.
My glamorous body.
My long lashes and clear eyes...
You won't come across many girls as pretty as me.
Will you?
T-True.
Naoya?!
I think you're really cute.
Of course.
I've actually seen your videos and thought you're attractive.
Right?
It'd be like a dream if I could make you my girlfriend.
Aw...
But... sorry.
Huh?

Episode 5
A Third One!?
Huh?
Sorry.
I can't date you.
Naoya! Well said!
Naoya-kun!
Y-You're going to reject me?!
W-Wait, you!
Are you actually going to reject me?
I'm sorry. Really.
If you're just looking for a boyfriend, you'll find one in no time.
But I'm so cute, and I'm huge on MeTube.
I'm obviously better than those two!
Is that really how you choose who to date?
Are you actually that proper?!
You're already dating two girls!
What's wrong with you?!
There'd be no end to it if I dated everyone who's cute.
Says a two-timer!
I want you to understand that, more than anything,
I want to make my two girlfriends happy.
Naoya...
Naoya-kun...
You'd have to be an idiot to reject me!
True...
Naoya!
Naoya-kun!
Right?
But...
Sorry.
What's your deal?!
Get it now?
Naoya already has enough girlfriends in the two of us.
Damn you...
Huh?
What are you...
They're G cups!
I work on my waist to maintain my figure, too!
I lose.
You might get a chance to squeeze these G cups if you go out with me.
That may be, but...
Y-You can try them out right now.
I don't care about your G cups.
I'd rather squeeze the boobs of a girl I like!
I-I can't believe I've been defeated by the likes of him.
Why?
How pitiful...
Um...
Wanna get going?
What should we have for dinner?
I was thinking nikujaga.
Sounds nice.
Don't just abandon me!
Wait, dinner?
You guys aren't...
Hey, wait!
Wait up!
Are you three living together?!
Shoot...
Let's run!
R-Right.
Hurry, Naoya-kun!
Hold it right there!
Naoya!
Naoya-kun!
I'll live with you, too.
Listen up...
I'll let you shoot me down today.
But I'm going to live with you and make you see what makes me so good.
I'll even pay rent.
And for food.
And for power and heating and Internet.
That's good enough for you, isn't it?
Milika-san...
I don't condone a man and woman living under the same roof if they aren't in a relationship.
How are you so proper?!
How are you so proper when you're a two-timer?!
I'll be back!
Nom, nom, nom...
Girlfriend, Girlfriend
We'd forgotten to eat, so we had to make it quick.
The Next Day After School
I'm home.
Nagisa-chan, what's for dinner?
What's up?
Wh-What is that?
A tent?
Milika!
If I can't live under the same roof, I'll live in the yard.
Oh, I get it. That's one solution.
Is this really the time to be impressed?!
But how did you know where we live?
Don't underestimate the Milika-sama.
I secretly followed you here.
I'm so hungry.
I can't wait for Nagisa-chan's dinner.
Yeah.
You're practically a stalker!
I'll make you regret humiliating me.
Just you wait!
I'm going to make you fall for me!
Should we call the cops?
D-Don't!
We have a new (outdoor) tenant...
Newbie
Girlfriend, Girlfriend
Setting up the tent was hard...
I can't believe she'd...
I'm camping out here until you fall in love with me.
What a nuisance.
What do we do?
Living in a tent sounds tough, though.
I don't think she's going to last.
Yeah.
They did say it's going to be chilly tonight.
Don't underestimate me!
S-So cold...
It's May...
What's happening?
I'm d-dying...
I'm going to die!
Milika-san.
Stop putting yourself in danger and go home.
I-I told you, I'm not going home until you fall for me!
You're still saying that?!
Are you going to live out there forever?
You ass!
I care about my two girlfriends.
Please give up.
Yeah.
Everyone's making fun of me.
Hell no!
I just need to buy an expensive sleeping bag to bear the cold!
And I can just kill all the bugs!
I'll stock up on everything I need!

Now I just need to hang on until it arrives!
And to make sure I don't run out of money...
I'll shoot videos to keep it coming in!
Milika here!
Today, I'm going to survive out in the cold in nothing but a T-shirt.
S-So cold...
Why are you so lightly dressed, then?
It's the cleavage that earns the clicks!
Sh-She's so strong.
Her cleavage...
I climbed up from F-tier MeTuber status.
I'll show you what I'm made of!
I can overcome the cold with exercise.
One, two, three...
Four, five, six...
My chest's right in the shot.
One, two, three...
Four, five, six...
Good, they're bouncing!
Good, I'm getting warm!
It's working!
She's actually going to stay until morning.
She's got a lot of stamina.
Time to take a break.
I-I can't!
It gets cold as soon as I stop!
I-I can't keep this up all night!
I'm not falling for her.
How sad.
Go home! Go home!
I'm not giving up!
Shake them! Shake them!
I-It's still only 2:00 AM.
I'm going viral!
Hurry up, Amazun!
Ramen! Yum!
I'm already cold again!
Saturday, May 15
She's still at it.
I-It's finally morning.
Delivery.
It's here!
My stuff's here!
S-So many packages...
I have nothing to fear now.
See this? This is me actually trying.
Well?
Say something.
Uh...
You should go home and take a shower.
You smell horrible.
I sweated like crazy!
I'm not done yet!
Water
Search! Search! Search!
Survival
Heating
Fill a black bag with water...
Throw it in a bag lined with tin foil...
And leave it in the sun.
Don't forget to film!
One hour.
Two hours. Done.
Tighten the ropes, hang it up...
Open some holes, and...
That feels great!
So warm!
Bliss!
How about that?
Are you impressed?
Y-You're so strong.
Told you!
She's actually going to live here.
What do we do?
Girlfriend, Girlfriend
Wash, wash, wash.
No looking!
Grab
What a pain this has turned into.
Yeah.
She really seems committed.
She's cute, she's got a good figure, and she's really aggressive.
All right.
I have a plan, Nagisa-chan.
Hear me out.
Whisper, whisper, whisper...
What?!
I don't know, Saki-san...
Do you really want her evil boobs to take Naoya away from us?
Well...
Unless I do something about the problem with Milika-san...
Going out with Saki-chan and Minase-san,
and making them both happy, isn't going to be easy.
I need to really think about it more.
What can I do?
Naoya.
Saki-chan, Minase-san...
What's wrong?
It's about Milika.
We decided we have to do something.
I feel that way, too.
So...
How about this?
Th-This is embarrassing.
We need to hang in there for our goal!
Sorry, I might not have been feeling the same way.
Why are you in your swimsuits?
Huh?
O-Obviously...
Because if we make you happy and get closer to you,
it won't matter anymore if Milika messes with you.
I will be your third girlfriend.
I'm going to make you fall for me!
You want to see us in swimsuits, don't you?
You pervert.
Isn't that too on-the-nose?!
What?!
What, then?
Ow!
Are you disappointed or something?
O-Of course not, but...
But?
Wait, Saki-san!
S-Sorry!
I-It's fine.
B-But...
I'd be glad if you appreciated that.
You, too, Minase-san?!
Not bad, Nagisa-chan.
That was obviously an accident!
I can't fall behind!
Th-They're too small! I can't hit him!
D-Did you see?
A little.
I gave away too much!
No, but...
Naoya's going to be obsessed with me now.
Huh? Um...
Is that all you wanted?
By that, do you mean my boobs?!
That's not it!
Shouldn't we be thinking about how to deal with Milika-san?!
There's a lot we ought to be doing.
W-Well...
Saki-san said we could seduce you in our swimsuits.
I did think it was a bit too blatant, but...
You did?!
But...
I think it's important to spend lots of time with you and make you like us more.
I want to do that, too.
So I put on my swimsuit, even though I was embarrassed.
Nagisa-chan...
I finally got to go out with Naoya-kun.
I wanted to make it last as long as I could.
It's true that we can't let our guard down when it comes to Milika-san.
I know there's a lot more that we need to consider.
But please look at us lots, too.
Minase-san...
She's right.
That's right.
There's a lot to do, but that was the most important thing.
All right. I'll look at you lots.
Thank you!
Staaare...
Staaare...
Staaare...
U-Um...
Huh?
N-Naoya-kun, you pervert.
That wasn't my intention!
Nagisa-chan's hot.
Milika here.
Today on Milika's channel...
I'm going to make you fall for me, Naoya.

Tsun Is Dere
A Girlfriend's Two Choices!
Are you an outdoorsy type? Or indoorsy?
Camping videos are popular, so the outside isn't bad.
I'm an indoors type.
I watch animeI mean, movies and stuff.
Anime?
No, I only watch the first episode of every new show and buy some merch and stuff.
I'm not really an otaku!
You totally are.
