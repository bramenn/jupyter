Don't you get bored? You've been sniffing stuff all day.
Cut it out.
Ouch...
Huh? I feel dizzy...
Party is over
But I still wanna dance
I can't even sleep
Someday, one day my passion's fire will
From the beginning I knew
One day the flames would die out
Hey, I thought I didn't need anything
But even now, I'm so serious
Ah... I still have time to make it
Ah... but I'm gonna burn it up, baby
Sorry darling, it's not that easy
But surely it's not that bad either
Give me fire
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah
Party is over
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it
Give me fire
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah
9 The story of the mercilessness
What do you want?
Dororo...
Dororo, body, hot...
Sick, huh? Sorry, but I'm just a farmer.
I ain't got no medicine. Don't know how to help.
Sorry, kid.
Mama?
Is something the matter?
Mama...
Don't worry, you just sleep some more.
This is a temple. Your friend brought you here.
Hyakkimaru?
Oh no!
You mustn't!
No! He'll leave me behind again.
Don't worry, he just went to go fetch some water.
Nobody is going to leave you behind.
I hate Manjushage, the red spider lilies.
They remind me of my papa and mama.
Were they such terrible parents?
No!
That's not it.
Papa and Mama were strong and kind.
Papa, take me with you next time.
If your mama says okay.
Those samurai had it coming.
Right, Boss?
All shivering pale like they saw a ghost.
We wouldn't even lose to Daigo's army now.
No doubt.
Who should we get next?
Let's see.
Go on to Mama now.
I wanna listen.
Dororo, I'll play with you later.
Humph, no way.
Mama!
I want to go with Papa.
I told you, no.
I can beat up the bad guys, too.
When you get a little bigger, okay?
I wanna go now! Please!
Do you want me to hang you up on a tree again?
What's with the puffed cheeks? Trying to be a squirrel?
I'm no squirrel.
Whatcha doing?
Throwing rocks. I can't use a sword, so I'll beat the bad guys like this.
I like the way you think.
But you know Dororo, you can't live on just strength from now on.
Big trouble!
The samurai are coming!
Dororo, you hide over there.
-Boss! -Came for revenge, huh.
You'll pay for what you did, you crooks!
We only strike samurai.
Don't take us for some lowlife scumbags!
Shut up!
-Dororo! -Mama.
Mama...
Don't worry. Your papa will always be your papa.
Yeah...
So, what now?
We'll round up some men and regroup.
We can't run away now, for the sake of the men we lost.
Ojiya, we'll have to move around for a while.
I guess so.
During these days, brigands scourged the lands of every region.
Their brutality brought fear into the hearts of the helpless.
Samurai who'd lost their lords formed their own bands.
And the poor joined them in order to make a living.
Each had their own reasons for joining.
Hibukuro's band consisted of farmers, and they only assaulted samurai.
They were quite a rare band of brigands.
Hey, Papa?
Why do you go beat up the samurai?
It's to teach them a lesson.
So that they'll treat us right.
Samurai don't even get that?
I'd say they've learned their lesson now.
What do you mean?
Take a look around. You've built up a pretty tough band.
Why don't you look towards the future now?
If you play your cards right, the lord will give you a good position.
Itachi, have you forgotten what they've done to us?
Because of the wars those lords started up,
our families were killed like they were nothing but bugs.
They burned down our village that we built up together.
Yeah, I've forgotten those things.
Can't hold on to things that've passed.
You gotta join forces with the samurai from here onwards.
You're a disgrace!
I didn't say anything wrong.
Say that one more time and you'll get a mouthful of this.
Fine.
The Yanagimoto guys are worn out from fighting Daigo.
Now's our chance.
Charge!
-No! -Mama!
Ojiya, Dororo!
Explain yourself, Itachi!
This whole place is going to be a battlefield in no time, Boss.
It's the age of the samurai.
You can't make a living being stubborn like you.
I'm taking your men with me.
You coward...!
I'll tear you to pieces!
No!
You can't even stand on those legs now.
Too bad you can't tear me to pieces.
The flames of Hibukuro have gone out, and he's just a sack of rags now.
No...
Itachi!
Let's find something to eat.
Mama...
Is this what hell is like?
I don't know, but it might not be as bad as this.
Why are Manjushage the color of blood?
They might've soaked up the blood of those who died in war.
Stop that. You're scaring the poor child.
Have mercy!
It took years for us to build this village up.
Silence! We must not have any obstacles in the way of our army.
These are our lord's orders!
No, please!
How are we supposed to live on?
Hands off!
Burn them down!
That's too cruel.
The lords and samurai think they can do anything if it's for a war. But...
Please, don't anymore.
Let's go.
Stop right there.
I'll never forget that huge pole sword.
Our homes were raided by brigands, and my friends were all killed.
I could never understand why I alone was left to live.
But now I know.
Hibukuro!
You bastard!
This is how you use a spear!
Papa... Papa...
Papa... Papa...!
Papa...
Mama, I'm hungry.
The war will end some day.
Once it does, you'll be able to eat all you want.
You mustn't lose to it until then, Dororo.
You there.
Yes?
It may be none of my business,
but samurai are giving handouts over at the temple down that way.
You should go there.
Itachi!
Well, what a surprise.
What are you doing here?
I got nice and cozy with the lord,
but now I've gotta achieve something out on the battlefield.
There are lots of brigands around here.
This is the quickest way to gather up some men.
So, how's Boss doing?
I see.
How've you been, Dororo?
Looking good... or maybe not.
Don't, Dororo.
But, I...
Listen to your mama.
Fine.
Almost out. Don't got enough for everyone.
Wait here, Dororo.
Please, give me some!
You ain't got a bowl.
Sorry, but we don't got any more to lend you.
Then pour it here.
But...
Give it to her.
O-Okay.
Mama, are you okay?
Of course. Eat it slowly now.
It's yummy. Aren't you going to eat?
Don't worry, eat up now.
I didn't want to see you like this. Sunken down so low.
Dororo!
You can't live on strength alone from here on out.
Use your brains.
Gotta be smart, or you'll die.
You jerk!
Mama?
Mama!
I'm fine. I just need to rest...
Mama...
Hold on, I'll go find some food.
Come here, Dororo.
The war will end some day...
You mustn't lose to it until then...
Mama? Mama!
Answer me, Mama.
I won't say I'm hungry anymore, so please don't die.
Mama, Mama...!
That's why I'm never going to give up.
I'm not going to lose to some war...
I know not how you two are related.
But it must be difficult traveling with such a young girl.
I pray that Buddha will bless you on your journey.
That nun said I had the 3-day fever.
I don't remember anything that happened.
Thanks for not leaving me behind.
Oh yeah. You can't see, but she washed my clothes, too.
See? They don't smell anymore.
Wait a minute...
So I had my clothes taken off?
Hey, did that nun say anything about me?
Did she?
Hey, I know you can hear me.
Say something, come on.
Can you hear me? Hey, I'm talking to you.
There was a former midwife who worked here
who had heard that a baby without limbs was sent floating down a river.
And 3 days ago,
a commander pursuing an Asakura spy was injured severely by an unknown man.
The commander said the man's arms were prosthetics.
Sorrow scatters in the wind,
piling up to form shadows
Our footsteps admonish indifference in such verbose ways
As I peek into your fathomless eyes, I lose my composure
Is there any hope in the place I am heading to?
I feign amusement and laugh
because this road is so dark
I will be there to shine the light
I'm used to playing at saying goodbye,
but I cried when I waved to you
Our fiery woes fade... and fade... until night falls upon us
If I knew tomorrow would be so mundane,
I wouldn't have said that I wanted to live
I know it's futile but can't help dreaming of a future... a future... you are to blame
