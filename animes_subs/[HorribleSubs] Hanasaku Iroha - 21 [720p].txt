Yes.

Episode 21 Rebirth of Die
What?! You're getting married?!
That's right. One can only become a man through marriage.
But do you have to do it right now?!
Speaking from a financial viewpoint,
it's definitely a bad idea.
However, we have love!
Love saves the world!
We don't need a wedding ceremony!
We're going to combine our efforts
and help Madam Manager!
Isn't that right, Takako?
Exactly so, Enishing.
Enishing?
Enishing means anything.
We have no secrets from each other!
We say anything to each other!
But, hey, I'm happy for you.
Congratulations!
And what are we congratulating now?
Madam Manager!
I was planning on telling you formally, but...
Please, will you acknowledge our forthcoming marriage?
Do whatever you please.
Please wait!
Takako!
Wait, Mother!
You don't trust me, do you, Mother?
But, mark my words, I will definitely regain your trust!
I'm prepared to work at this inn for the rest of my life!
So, please, Mother...
Could you stop calling me that?
Within the grounds of Kissuiso,
I'm to be called Madam Manager,
and not Enishi's mother.
However, there is one requirement.
What?
If you're getting married, make sure you hold a wedding ceremony.
B-But...
Wedding ceremonies aren't there for self-satisfaction.
You have a reputation to uphold as
the successor of Kissuiso.
If you can't even understand that,
you've got a long way to go before you can take charge here.
It's leftover fish soup.
Would you care to join us, Miss Takako?
The scent of a reefy coast stings my troubled heart.
Man... I wasn't expecting her to be so stubborn about it...
Come on, she's just telling you to hold a proper ceremony.
That's right! It's not like she's against it.
Holding a wedding reception at an ordinary hotel would
cost at least 1,600,000 yen.
I-I didn't know it would cost that much to get married.
Why don't you use...
That's it!
Why don't you use Kissuiso for your grand marriage ceremony?!
What?!
If we help out, most of the costs would be covered!
That's a wonderful idea!
Takako!
Huh?
We can't do that.
We'd be interfering with the inn's normal operation.
Like you've never done that before.
Don't let that concern you.
Tohru, you're in charge of the food for the ceremony.
M-Me?!
That's right...
If I were to take on extra waitress duties that day...
Ohana and Nako can...
Awesome!
I'm in charge of the food for the reception?!
Right, Minko, let's take a look at the market!
Okay!
Wow, it's finally begun!
I love you guys!
The days I just circled are supposed to be the luckiest.
Wow, there's not even a month left.
Yeah, the Bonbori Festival takes place in the fall, after all.
As the successor, I can't hold my wedding
when the inn is at its busiest.
Then couldn't you delay the wedding until after that?
No, I can't do that!
What if Takako changes her mind?!
Enishing, about the cost...
Coming!
How about some northern pink shrimp and righteye flounders?
It's got to be food for a celebration.
I've got to keep the costs down, but I need to make it
look festive as well as taste good.
It's a wedding,
so no one will blame me if the food is a little too extravagant.
Oh, the dish I had at the cultural festival was fun.
That omelet rice with LOVE written on it.
Perhaps I could do something similar with the carp...
Line them up and write LOVE with miso and vinegar.
I-I don't know about that...
Mr. Nori, can I take a look at that?
Sure!
Getting married is wonderful, isn't it?
I'm at an age where I'm supposed to start thinking about that kind of stuff.
A-Already?!
Yeah. I like kids.
I'd like at least five or so.
F-Five?!
I prefer families to be noisy.
Something wrong?
N-Nothing.
Want to stop by?
W-Wait, but...
Tohru!
Come on, now! Take a deep breath!
You'll feel refreshed!
You've been acting a little odd recently, that's all.
Listen, both Mr. Ren and I have been in
the same position as you, a commis-chef.
Huh?
You may come to a standstill or get irritated
because things don't work out the way you want them to,
but what you gain from hard work will never betray you.
Everyone gets in a slump.
That's not what's been bugging me.
But... you're worried about me.
Umm, I...
Well...
I really want to make the young master's wedding ceremony a success!
I want to work with you to make it a success,
and after that...
After that...
there's something I want to...
Make it a success?
You're talking like Ohana now.
That girl always manages to get others involved in things.
Before you notice it, you're a part of it.
The atmosphere at the inn has changed a lot since she arrived.
Takako used to be just a nuisance.
Yeah, let's make it a success.
Don't copy her too much, though.
We don't need two troublemakers.
What else do we need for a wedding?
There's got to be some form of entertainment, right?
But we don't have the money...
Money?
That means naught when up against love.
Money means nothing?
I suggest you make remarks like that after you've finished paying your rent.
Wait a second!
It was just a line.
I was thinking that we could perform a skit at the ceremony,
like re-enacting how they fell in love.
That sounds fun!
But can any of us act?
It'll be fine.
I've got the perfect line for you.
I-I'm going to get pregnant!
Sexual harassment?
Oh, they're back!
Wow, you've bought so much already?!
I thought I'd practice making it first.
All right! Can I taste it?!
Dummy.
I'll lend you a hand.
I touched something disgusting...
No, no...
Even if we keep the cost of the dress this low,
we still have the rings to worry about...
Enishing, I should get going now.
Oh, I'll see you out.
It's fine.
Besides, we can use a rental dress.
The ring can also be cheap-
No, it can't!
At least the ring's got to be nice!
Takako?
It's nothing.
Anyway, I'm off.
Your name's Nako, right?
Y-Yes.
Adieu!
H-Hey...
Did I say something bad again?
Oh, is it because I suggested we hold the wedding here?
Is it too much effort for you?
But it's a wonderful thing,
and though it may be a lot of work-
What do you mean by a lot of work?
You're the one who said we should do it.
Let's have the wedding here.
With your loud, annoying, and disgusting voice.
Just hold on a sec. I'm used to loud and annoying,
but disgusting?!
We're the ones who get troubled by your whimsical actions.
Not just me.
Everyone.
Especially Tohru!
Tohru?
Yeah. You're always relying on Tohru for everything.
Repay the debt!
What?
Go out with him!
What?
Go out with Tohru!
What?!
Wh-Why Tohru and me-
You're always pretending that you don't know.
You always take the best parts!
Think about Tohru's feelings!
Take responsibility for changing Kissuiso's atmosphere!
I don't know what the heck you're-
Shut up!
I'm completely lost here,
but if I were to go out with Tohru,
what about you?!
Don't you like him?!
Why on Earth are you saying such things?!
Shut up! Die!
Looks like die is back in fashion...
Hey! That's charred!
H-Hot!
What are you doing?!
I'm sorry!
Jeez... there goes breakfast.
I'm sorry...
Minko, don't worry about helping out with the wedding anymore.
I'll do it myself.
What?
How can you expect to be trusted if you can't even perform your daily tasks?
You'll be in Mr. Ren's way.
You look like you've got something to say.
I don't think...
I'll ever be able to say it!
Minko...
Minchi!
H-How about we have lunch together?
Let's invite Oshimizu and we can all have lunch together.
I'll give you some of my fried egg.
Oh, Oshimizu!
What's that?
Curtains.
The teacher said he was putting up new ones.
But they still look new!
They're changing them to red ones.
According to color therapy, it's supposed to be better for the students' minds.
A red classroom...
That's kind of erotic.
But it's kind of a waste, isn't it?
It's not like we can help it.
Let's get this out of the way and have lunch, okay?
I wonder if we can use this...
What?
Where's Madam Manager and the others?
I hear Madam Manager's at a meeting.
The young master is with Takako, planning their wedding.
Planning their wedding, eh?
Takako's looking out into the blue.
She doesn't really seem to be so gung-ho about the idea.
I'm sure she has a lot to worry about.
What was it... marriage browns?
You mean Bryans.
But you know, we're helping out with their marriage.
Why is the person we're helping out acting this way?!
Your natto's starting to bubble up.
What?
Natto tastes better if you stir it until it gets bubbly.
Really?
That's what I'm talking about!
Perhaps I should search somewhere nearer for someone to marry.
Ah, I went off the line!
We've got a lot of curtains, so don't worry if you mess up.
Still, making a wedding dress out of curtains, eh?
That's an incredible idea.
I wanted to be of some help to Takako's wedding.
I didn't think you'd lend us a hand!
Oh, don't worry about it. I love events like this.
Isn't Ohana going to use the sewing machine?
She's apparently not very good with technology.
Oh...
What about cellphones?
I asked Minchi, but she refused to help.
Tohru likes me?
No, that can't be true.
Well, I'm not exactly good at noticing things...
like that situation with Ko...
No, but Ko is...
No, it's...
W-Wow, she's so fast!
And so accurate!
Can't you make it cheaper? I was your brother's classmate.
What? You don't remember me?
It's been 15 years, but I still remember you.
W-Wait, don't hang up!
No, I'm not done yet!
Hello, I'm from Kissuiso.
We bought a large quantity of futons from your store six years ago.
I'd like to call off the wedding with Enishi.
I understand why you won't acknowledge me!
I also understand why you can't leave us in charge of this inn.
say anything to each other!
But you...
This is something I was given by my late husband.
He and I worked at the same inn.
He was a chef, and I was a waitress.
Around the same time we decided to get married,
the owner gave us an offer.
He asked whether we'd like to succeed
an inn that had no successor.
From then on, we worked hard in order to restore it.
Denroku, who worked at the previous inn, helped us too.
We had no time or money to hold a wedding,
but he gave me this.
In hopes of Kissuiso becoming successful.
Kissuiso?
Yeah, that's what our inn will be called.
What?
The kanji in the name means, an inn to please you, Sui.
But we should think about the customers, not me.
We can't please our customers without pleasing ourselves first.
But...
Besides, it's not just for you.
If you're pleased, so am I.
It's so beautiful...
Yeah.
He was always by my side after that.
He'd always wish for my happiness.
It's still the same even after he passed away.
Marriage
is a promise not to let your spouse be alone, ever again.
Your spouse...
Yes, even if one of you passes away first.
So...
Takako, I entrust Enishi's happiness to you.
When you told us to have the marriage ceremony,
I assumed you weren't planning on letting us succeed the inn.
Yes, that's correct.
I'm not.
What?
Now, for the baiser amor!
Come at me if you can!
I'm so touched!
What?
Touched? Oh, please...
Episode 22 A Determined One-Sided Crush
It's not weird.
