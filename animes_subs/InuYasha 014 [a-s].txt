Who is that?!
Hey, are you all right?!
Here it is... Right here!
There's no mistake!
Just enough moisture...
And the soil is good, too.
Intruder! I asked who you are?!
- Identify yourself! - Silence!
I just have some business with the urn buried here!
Once I possess it, I'll leave this sore sight of a village!
So... She knows what's buried here!
Leave immediately! Else I'll show no mercy!
You talk too much, you stubborn ignorant old woman!
Didn't I tell you not to interfere?!
Priestess Kaede!
T-that is my sister's!
I will not let you have it!
Not a demon like you!
I am the demoness, Urasue!
Kikyo's ashes...
are now in MY possession!
Inuyasha!
Damn!
Who is that?!
That's...Kagome?
No, it's not...
That's Kikyo...
The one who bound me to the tree!
A dream...
Brought back ugly memories.
They look alike...
Kagome looks exactly like Kikyo.
Inuyasha?
Stop scaring me like that!
I thought you were a scary demon.
Huh? Did I punch you just now? Sorry!
Nope, not like her at all!!
What is?
Not one little bit!
What're you talking about?!
What is it, Inuyasha?
Nothing!
What's that?
What? A demon?
What is it? I'm getting the scent of new blood...
Hold it... The smell of that blood...
What's the matter, Inuyasha?
Why the sudden urge to go back to the village?
I'm still sleepy!
Priestess Kaede, you mustn't move yet!
Never mind! It's not a serious wound.
Granny Kaede!
You?
What happened to you?
So you're still alive.
I guess not even a flesh wound will keep you down.
So, you caught the scent of my blood on that demon.
Look, think of your age and take it easy!
So... He wanted to return because he was worried about old Kaede.
What's this?
This used to be my sister, Kikyo's gravesite.
A grave, here?
I was not strong enough to stop her.
I take possession!
My sister had unusually strong powers, even for a priestess.
If her ashes get into the hands of some demon...
who knows for what evil purpose they will be used?
Inuyasha!
Forget it!
Kikyo and I were enemies.
Have you forgotten who shot an arrow into my chest?
You're right...
I heard that happened fifty years ago...
It's Inuyasha!
Inuyasha the half-demon wanted to take the Sacred Jewel...
and become a full-fledged demon.
When he came to the village to take the Jewel...
the priestess, Kikyo, shot a sacred arrow which...
held him fast to a tree.
Inuyasha!
K-Kikyo...
Why you!
But in that battle, Kikyo would lose her life.
Sister!
Demoness Urasue...
She didn't just steal Kikyo's ashes.
I could smell the dirt from the grave...
Just what is she up to?
Let's go, Inuyasha.
Where?
Don't you feel sorry for Kikyo, that her grave has been violated?
Forget that you were once bitter enemies.
Kikyo died long ago, right?
- Hey! - What?
Since yesterday, you've been avoiding looking at me!
It's nothing...
I know! It's because I look like Kikyo!
That's why you don't like me, right?!
It's not!
Huh?
It's not like that.
W- what?
W-what is it?!
W- what was that just now? What?
What was that?
Darn! What're you doing?!
Y-you're the one!
What did I do?!
Huh?
Granny...
I am also a priestess.
I will take back my sister's ashes with my own hands.
Inuyasha, at least tell me in which direction...
Urasue is headed?
Do you wanna die, old woman?
Inuyasha!
Well, I'll have to go to find out.
Granny Kaede, you mustn't! You're in no condition!
It's useless to stop her!
That's why I hate dealing with old people!
I'll get Kikyo's ashes back.
And I'll be sure to bring home your bones, too.
Inuyasha, thank you.
Granny Kaede, may I come along?
Kagome?
Inuyasha's eyes just now...
He wasn't seeing me...
He was seeing Kikyo inside me.
Granny's asleep.
You'd better get some sleep.
We'll attack tomorrow.
So soon?
I can smell it... She's not far.
Inuyasha...
He's asleep.
When I first saw Inuyasha, he was sleeping, too.
Actually, he was bound to a tree...
But to me, he looked like sleeping peacefully.
I thought he hated Kikyo...
I know! It's because I look like Kikyo!
That's why you don't like me, right?!
It's not!
Huh?
It's not like that.
Inuyasha's eyes...
weren't the eyes of hatred.
My heart is still pounding.
I wonder if Inuyasha...
Maybe Inuyasha...
actually was in love with Kikyo.
We must retrieve Kikyo's ashes as soon as possible!
I have a dreadful feeling about this.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?!
If you didn't want the ashes stolen...
why didn't you just scatter the ashes into the river?
You stayed sentimental and kept hanging on to them...
and see what happened?
Inuyasha, how do you feel about a grave?
A grave is not simply a place to bury a body or ashes.
A grave is necessary for the hearts of ones who are left behind.
Hearts of those left behind?
My sister was born a priestess.
And she used her special powers for the good of the villagers.
She kept demons away from the village...
and battled illness and famine countless times...
encouraging the people around her.
Even after her demise...
the villagers have not weakened, they are resolved to live.
However, man is weak.
Danger and uncertainty can weaken his heart.
The grave was a place of reassurance.
A place where hearts could find peace.
Hmm? Just like that time...
Inuyasha is thinking of Kikyo...
Inuyasha was in love with Kikyo.
But she shot an arrow into him...
and he was bound for fifty years...
I feel really sorry for him.
Huh?
It was unrequited love...
Unrequited love... unrequited love!
What's with you, Kagome?!
That look... gives me the creeps!
Why're you looking so sorry for me?!
Oh, sorry! I was thinking nonsense.
Huh? What?
Well...
What is it?!
Well... What were you thinking?! Hey!
Oh, shut your mouth!
Now then!
Let's see the result of my special magic...
Kneading the earth from the grave with the ashes...
and baking it in my Demon Kiln!
Hmm... Looks quite good!
Now then...
Let's see...
Arise! Open your eyes, Kikyo!
Kikyo... I have heard that as a priestess...
you foiled many an attempt by demons...
to possess the Sacred Jewel.
I also hear that the Jewel is now in fragments...
and a demon who possesses even one fragment of the Jewel...
doubles its powers!
I want it... I want every fragment of the Sacred Jewel!
Now, you will go and destroy every demon who seeks it...
Burn and destroy them!
You will serve me... the one who has brought you back to life!
You will gather the fragments of the Sacred Jewel!
Huh... W-what is this?
A soul... The soul hasn't returned!
There is no way my magic would fail to bring back the soul!
Does this mean that the soul has already been reincarnated...
in another body?!
Then all I made was a hollow shape in the form of Kikyo!
Damn! Making me work so hard and wasting my time!
Setting me up for failure like this! How maddening!
I can't stand this! I can't stand it!
What's this?
Earthen dolls? How creepy!
Well, there it is.
Huh?!
We have to cross this?!
I'm so scared!!!
You don't have to come.
I'll go in and talk some sense into her.
Don't be silly! I refuse to be left behind on a bridge like this?!
So come...
Wait!
There're more of the earthen dolls.
What's that?!
Soldiers of the old demoness!
Those are the dolls we saw... It can't be?!
Inuyasha! Behind you!
Kagome, Old Woman... It's gonna shake a bit.
Iron Reaver Soul Stealer!
Are these guys really made of mud?!
Foxfire!
They're not that strong!
Just that they're so many of'em!
What's the ruckus outside?
Oh, I can't stand this!
I'll go out and work off this frustration!
Hey!
Let go! This belongs to me!
Inuyasha! Watch out!
What does this mean? Could it...
The resemblance! Such a close resemblance!
What coincidence! Such good fortune!
That face... No mistake!
Inuyasha!
Kagome!
Granny! Shippo!
Hey, let me go!
If I let go, you'll die.
And now that I've found my reincarnated soul...
As if I'd let you go!
I need you! In order to fully resurrect Kikyo!
Resurrect... Kikyo?!
Kikyo who died during the Warring States Era is resurrected!
If the Sacred Jewel burst out of my body...
then perhaps, I really am the reincarnation of Kikyo.
Urasue forces me to drink a potion and...
my soul is sucked out of me!
Kikyo and Inuyasha's reunion after fifty years...
Rather than fond memories...
Kikyo still harbors a deep grudge and she goes after Inuyasha!
Return of the Tragic Priestess, Kikyo! Don't miss it!
