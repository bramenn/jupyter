Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
Phantom's Magical Giant has activated and is trying to cast Abyss Break to destroy all of Magnolia!
And fierce battles with the Element 4 have begun, as they wait to ambush us after we broke inside!
In one battle, Mira has been taken hostage, and when Elfman sees her...
Let my sister go!
It'll be all right! I'll yell it out countless times.
I believe your every tomorrow will be shining.
The intersection of all people
Never giving up. And that's why we're not gonna lose!
When it seems like you'll be blown away by the headwinds,
grasp this hand, try to take a chance.
Because you're not alone anymore, got it?
Go forward, more and more!
Don't give up on your awesome dream!
That's right, don't cry!
Move on, my way!
Now, with the light shining down upon you.
Don't even think about something like giving up!
Even if you trade being hurt again for strength.
Your eyes, always looking straight ahead,
can surely see the light!
Huh? When did I get home?
I could have sworn Phantom was attacking...
Was it all a dream?
Yup, that's right. All just a dream.
So go right back to sleep...
Nice body!
Destroy the moon!
This makes no sense!
Hey, isn't something moving?
Drip, drip, drop...
You're freakin' me out!
Drip, drip, drop...
G-Get out...
Lucy!
Are you okay, Lucy?
This is my room!
No, it's not!
Wait, where am I?
A Flower Blooms in the Rain
I-It can't be... This is...
A Full Body Take Over...
Beast Soul!
Non, non, non!
With non of three, you misunderstand me!
I, Monsieur, gave you such a harsh trial for you to finally overcome your difficult past, bonsoir!
You are indeed a Man among men, Elfman!
I, Monsieur, believed you could overcome it!
Right?
Well then, if you'll be excusing me...
How dare you!
Platre... Sonate!
Non, non, non... Don't let your guard down now.
Non! Non! Non!
Non! Non! Non!
Elfman...
Ooh... Oui...
Je t'aime...
Non, at least let me fall unconscious!
Elfman!
Au revoir...
So... Can you...
Could you have lost your reason again?
Elfman!
I'm sorry, Nee-chan...
You must never have wanted to see me like this again.
Because I wasn't able to control it, Lisanna...
You still have your reason!
But I didn't know what else to do.
I had to get stronger to protect you and Fairy Tail!
Lisanna's death wasn't your fault.
You were trying your best to protect us both back then.
But I failed.
Lisanna died.
I'm still here.
Nee-chan...
We decided together, remember?
To live on in her stead.
To work as hard as we could...
Nee-chan! I'm so glad you're all right!
And how is crying going to help anything?
But!
Thank you, Elfman...
What is it, Nee-chan?
The giant isn't writing as quickly...
The forbidden magic of the four elements...
Abyss Break...
The four elements. Fire, water, wind, and earth...
Elfman, how many of the Element 4 are left?
Hmm, um...
That'd make two left, I guess?
As I thought!
Each time we get one of them, the giant's movements slow down!
Why is that?
In other words, this giant is powered by the four elements.
If we can defeat all of the Element 4, we can stop the magic!
Really?
Hurry! The remaining two should be somewhere inside the giant!
R-Right!
Thank goodness... It looks like Mira's safe.
Cana!
I'm fine.
Focus on the enemy in front of you and protect Fairy Tail!
You don't know when to quit...
Everyone, don't clump together! Spread out and fight!
Right!
It's the women in our guild who are the strong ones...
Oh yeah, where's Loke?
He said something worried him, so he headed to that place.
Say what?
He skipped out?
If Abyss Break is cast, then that place wouldn't be safe either.
I see...
He has good intuition.
I just thought of something good, Happy!
What?
If we beat up Jose, then that'd end the fight, right?
What are you saying?
Jose's just as powerful as our own master!
Someone like you could never beat him, Natsu!
But Gramps isn't here, so who else is gonna?
Natsu, you idiot!
I was trying not to think about it, but you made me remember!
Wha?
That's right... Master's gone... Erza's gone...
No matter what happens in this war, in the end Jose will...
I'm here, aren't I?
Right?
Aye!
Why is it, I wonder?
The master and Erza have more magic power,
but there's something about Natsu that gives everyone hope!
The sorrow!
The wings of flame, clipped... Falling to the ground...
Ah, and all that's left is the corpse of a dragon!
Natsu, he's one of the Element 4!
My name is Aria!
I am at the top of the Element 4!
And I have come to hunt me a dragon!
A wind wizard?
I'm already used to you guys.
Erigor's nothing compared to him!
Was it raining before?
Drip, drip, drop...
Yes... Juvia is the rain woman, one of the Element 4.
Drip, drip, drop...
You're one of the Element 4?
I never would have thought that two of the elements would have been defeated.
But do not underestimate Juvia and Aria.
Sorry to break it to you, but I don't go easy on people who hurt my friends.
Even if they're women or children...
R-Really?
Juvia gives up then! Goodbye!
Whoa there! What the heck?
What is wrong with Juvia?
Why is my heart beating like this?
Wait, you! Stop the giant!
Juvia wants to make him her's!
Juvia can no longer hold back!
Water Lock!
Oh, no! He's injured! Whatever shall I do?
I must release him quick, or...
He escaped from Juvia's water lock using his own power?
This is the power of an ice wizard...
Exquisite!
Water and ice...
It's like we're bound by fate!
I've finally found you, Juvia's Prince!
Trying for a surprise attack, you bastard!
Ouch!
Why is he stripping?
I-I-I think we should take things more slowly...
I don't want to frighten a woman, but you'd better surrender immediately.
Otherwise you're gonna get hurt!
Ice Make Lance!
Juvia's body is made of water.
Yes... Drip, drip, drop...
That's right... He's an enemy.
Torn apart by strife, that is their tearful fate!
But Juvia will not lose heart!
Farewell, my small blossom of love!
Water Slicer!
High powered water jets can even cut through steel.
Underestimate water, and you will regret it.
Ice Make Battle Axe!
Try again and again, but nothing will change.
Against Juvia, physical attacks are ineffective.
Yes... Drip, drip, drop...
She's a tough one...
You cannot defeat Juvia.
You still have a chance to save yourself.
Bring me Lucy Heartfilia, please.
If you do, I will ask my master to withdraw.
Hey, don't give me that crap.
We're both already way past the point of retreating.
And Lucy is our ally!
I'll give up my life before handing her over to you!
Give up his life?
Give up his life?
Give up his life?
A love rival!
A love rival!
A love rival!
A love rival!
A love rival!
What pain!
What harsh fate!
My heart... My heart feels like it's going to rend asunder!
It hurts!
It hurts!
What's the matter? Are you ill?
Juvia will not forgive.
Lucy shall not be forgiven!
Lucy shall not be forgiven!
Ouch!
Boiling water?
And why are you mad at Lucy?
Ice Make...
It's fast!
My Creation Magic can't keep up!
That was close...
Ever since Juvia was born, she's lived within the rain.
In the rain, there is no one who can defeat Juvia!
Be boiled inside Juvia's jealously!
What?
Ice Make Shield!
What incredible heat! I can't stand it!
I told you already!
Inside the rain is Juvia's world!
No one can defeat Juvia!
He used the steam as a smoke screen?
He's not just a pretty face, he's smart, too.
So amazing...
I don't have time to take a break!
I've got to stop that magic quick!
That's hot!
My skin is burning!
This is the end for you!
Why, you...
He flew straight into the boiling water!
Freeze!
B-But...
Juvia's boiling water was frozen?
And...
That's not... It's not...
Juvia is so embarrassed!
Like this, forever, inside your ice...
Sorry!
He released me from the ice?
Why?
He's too kind!
Let's start over again!
No, I can't. Juvia cannot bring herself to harm you...
Huh?
So you're admitting you can't win against me?
Juvia is stronger than Lucy.
Juvia will be able to protect you.
Protect? Me?
B-Because...
I-I... l-lo...
Sheesh, now the rain's gotten stronger.
Juvia is frustrated!
Man, this rain is so gloomy...
Gloomy... Gloomy... Gloomy...
What's the matter?
He's no different than all the others!
You're all the same!
What?
Juvia has no need for love anymore!
I'll freeze it again!
It won't freeze? Is it even hotter than before?
Love... Who needs love?!
I wish Juvia would take a long vacation...
When she's around it's always raining and gloomy.
Yes.
Juvia is a rain woman.
Man, how gloomy!
What's this?
Why is it always raining?
I can't go fishing or camping with you around.
I'm sorry. But Juvia doesn't know what else to do...
I can't stand this gloom anymore.
Let's break up, okay?
This rain is really gloomy.
The longer it rains, the gloomier it gets!
Man, this is gloomy.
Rain sucks. It's so gloomy.
Juvia is nothing but a gloomy rain woman!
And yet Phantom Lord accepted Juvia for who she is!
Juvia is one of the Element 4! A Phantom Wizard!
I'm not gonna lose!
Not to Phantom!
He even froze the rain?
What incredible magical power!
Ice Geyser!
I've lost...
It's all over now... Everything...
Juvia, like a raindrop, will fall to the ground, and scatter into tiny fragments...
A fitting end to an unwanted rain woman...
Farewell, my gloomy self...
Don't let go of my hand!
I'm not letting you fall!
Why did you save Juvia?
Beats me.
Anyway, get some sleep.
Why did he...
So, finally cooled down?
Huh?
The rain has stopped...
Oh, it's finally clearing up.
These are... clear skies...
I've never seen them before...
Really?
Nice, huh?
Clear skies are great.
Yes... They're beautiful, truly...
So, up for round 2?
Hey! What's the matter?
Hang in there!
Hey! Hey!
A lot of time has passed, but the magic hasn't activated yet!
This is bad for my heart.
How long until it's over?
Wait, isn't that giant moving turtlish?
Huh? Turtl-what?
She means it's moving more slowly, I think.
Try speaking so we can understand you!
I like talking this way!
Natsu and the others inside are doing their best to hold it back, I bet.
All we can do is...
I guess we should clean them up, then.
Let's go!
Yeah!
Gray!
Elfman! And Mira too?
So this is the third Element 4?
Why does she look so happy?
Beats me. Maybe she's having a nice dream.
Only one left!
If we can defeat one more, we can stop Abyss Break.
The Magic Giant moves using the power of the Element 4.
We can still make it!
We can do it!
I see...
I was put to sleep by Mira...
Oui. This is our emergency hide-out.
I lost my keys...
I guess I was in everyone's way.
No choice then, yeah?
That's not it.
We just wanted to protect our friend.
Getting in the way doesn't have anything to do with it.
Reedus...
But that's why I can't just sit here!
I've got to go back!
You can't, Lucy!
Think of what Mirajane...
But...
Oh, no! What is this?
Lucy, stand back!
You do well to remain standing.
Impressive.
Damn you...
What's with this guy?
I've never seen Natsu in such a one-sided fight!
But in the face of my Airspace magic, you are powerless!
What the hell is Airspace magic?
Invisible magic! What should we do?
You can still stand, Salamander?
I can't be defeated here.
Because I'm a Fairy Tail wizard!
Now I'm fired up, you bastard!
All right!
Defeat one more, and we stop that magic!
Aye!
But there's still Gajeel and Master Jose.
I forgot!
I wonder if I can get something to eat before fighting them.
Aye!
Then let's search for the kitchen first!
Next time: Wings of Flame!
Isn't that Erza?
Oh, no! If she finds out we're taking a break here, she'll get mad!
Run for it, Happy!
Aye!
