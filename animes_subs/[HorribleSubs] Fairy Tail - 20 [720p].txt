Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
This is Magnolia's East Forest.
It is said to be a mysterious forest that holds magical powers.
Why do I have to go fishing with you when I'm busy writing my novel?
Well you were getting in a funk'cause you couldn't think of any good ideas, right?
Aye. When that happens you should go out for a change of pace.
But why fishing?
Because fish are my bread and butter.
And your point?
Why should I have to fish up your favorite food?
I hooked one!
It's a big one! Be careful!
Leave it to me!
Whoa!
Upa!
What the heck does upa mean anyway?!
Enjoying themselves as usual, I see.
That's right, we can do it!
Let's go for even more who-knows-what!!
The door to mystery is right in front of us
The whole world's a wonderland
which we're already wondering!!!
This excitement gets my heart racing
It's wonderful!
Who am I, I wonder?
What is real, I wonder?
Why can't I see tomorrow, I wonder?
The only part leveling up is my curiosity
We can't just throw away our daily life together, right?
Tell me! S. O. W.
Living itself will be our training!
So, we can make it!
Let's search for even more who-knows-what!
We can't be satisfied with just the normal answers
This magical wonder life
Our future is wondering!!!
We'll do our best living our life
the way we want to!
Let's wondering!!!
Fish! Fish!
I'm so happy!
Yum! Yum!
Um, you're not a little kid,'kay?
Looks delish!
How could you?!
Fish taste best raw!
Why not? They taste good grilled, too.
No, no! I wanted to eat it raw!
Well, I caught it.
You should catch your own big one.
My fish!
Bones and all?
Oh, that hit the spot.
How could you?!
Our friendship is over!
This isn't a sports drama, you know.
Not going after him?
After who?
Oh, honestly... You keep up that tough guy act, and you'll never get a girl to like you.
Much better. Now hurry up and apologize.
Shut the hell up...
What was that? Creepy!
Natsu and the Dragon Egg!
This is the Fairy Tail Archives.
Mira-san, what are you doing?
I'm sorting some old materials.
I'll help too!
I'd be happy to have your help.
Sure! Any time!
So, don't you think Natsu was being a jerk?
But that's what makes him cute.
You think?
You also like Natsu's childlike side. Right, Lucy?
Are you okay?
Sorry...
I'm not really used to this.
What's this drawing?
Oh, how nostalgic!
Is this everyone when they were kids?
That's right.
So this is Gray, and next to him is Cana.
Macao and Wakaba?!
They're so young!
That kid with the spiky head's Natsu, right?
He hasn't changed a bit.
And... huh?
What's that small dragon?
Happy!
How did Natsu and Happy meet in the first place anyway?
Yes... That was right after I joined Fairy Tail...
About 6 years ago.
Hey, Natsu!
Natsu is...
Droopy eyes!
Squinty eyes!
Shut up!
Back then Natsu and Gray would start fighting whenever they saw each other.
So... no different than now?
Flame-brain!
Underwear-man!
Stop it, you two!
And the one who stopped them from fighting...
Shut up, you!
You want a piece of me?!
Why not?
Got it?
Don't get in stupid fights again.
Shuddap...
I'll get you next time.
That's how Natsu was, but other than fighting, he didn't do much else.
Sometimes he'd get this really lonely look on his face.
Then, one day...
Gray... Erza...
One day I'll beat the crap outta you both!
T-That didn't hurt!
W-What's that?
It's an egg!
I found an egg!
Where in the world did you get that?
I picked it up in the East Forest!
The East Forest?
Look at that... Natsu is good for somethin' after all.
Everyone gonna eat it?
Gray, your clothes!
You're kiddin' me!
This is a dragon egg!
I'm gonna hatch it!
A dragon?
Just look at the strange markings. They look like a dragon's talons!
You think?
So, Gramps... Force the dragon to hatch!
What are you saying, you dimwit!
In this world, there is no magic that defames life!
Life is given birth from love.
And no magic can change that!
I don't get you at all.
Perhaps you are too young.
In other words, if you want to hatch it, you should work hard at it yourself.
Since the only thing you usually do is destroy stuff,
this is an excellent chance for you to learn how to give birth to something.
Erza?
You were here?
Erza's back, you say?
We'll continue where we left off!
Come at me!
Fighting, again?
Now that you mention it, we haven't finished things, have we...
Wait, Mira? As in, you, Mira-san?
Yes... And?
You're like a totally different person!
And you even picked a fight with Erza?
Die, Erza!
I'll make you cry, Mirajane!
You clanky bastard!
You midriff baring bastard!
You prickly bastard!
You bony bastard!
Fatty!
Four-eyes!
Way to lower the bar, guys...
And Erza was telling us not to fight...
This is pissing me off...
Damn it!
Erza, Mira... I'll beat up the both of ya one day!
Oh, honestly... You keep up that tough guy act, and you'll never get a girl to like you.
And who asked you, Lisanna?
Hey, Natsu! Is it okay if I help you raise the egg together?
You'll help?!
Sure! Raising an egg looks like fun.
Uh, is it really raising it?
What should we do to make it hatch?
You warm it up!
Warm it up? Well, that's my specialty!
Are you an idiot?
Sheesh, don't do that!
If you heat it that much it'll burn!
R-Really?
Just leave it to my magic.
Take Over! Animal Soul!
Ooh, it's a bird!
I get it now!
Why don't I try warming it like this?
You're smart, Lisanna!
What's the matter, Elfman?
Lisanna can use a full body Take Over, but I can't...
Even though we're on the same team...
Oh, right. You use the same magic as her.
If I could use it, then I could turn into a bird and search for my parakeet...
Parakeet?
I had one as a pet, but I lost it...
Oh, I see.
I wish I had an egg like that.
So, that's Elfman?
He was cute!
Oh? I don't think he's changed much.
Magnolia South Gate Park.
This is starting to get uncomfortable...
So we just do this and wait?
Yeah! But that's kind of boring.
The egg moved!
What?
Huh? It calmed down...
Wait, maybe the egg wants you to keep it warm, Natsu.
Huh? Me?
Yeah! It seems happy!
So, you want to be with me?
It made a sound!
That's got to be it!
Why you little...
Hey, why don't we make a home for the egg?
A secret base?
Finished!
What do you think? Pretty cool house, right?
Does it really have to be cool?
That was dangerous!
Making a house is tricky, isn't it?
Substitution!
Leave it to me!
You're huge!
I'm a rabbit, okay?
Just wait there a bit.
Awesome! All I can do is break stuff!
Tada!
Finished!
Wow! You're awesome!
Now, come on in!
Undo your transformation first.
It's pretty spacious when you get inside.
Isn't it?
Anyway, let's have a seat.
S-Sure...
We're almost like a family.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, there's a daddy and a mommy and a baby, right?
Yeah, I guess that's not so bad.
Let's warm up the egg together.
Right.
It's warm...
It moved again!
I hope it hatches soon!
Huh? A dragon egg?
Something like that wouldn't exist.
Natsu did say that he was raised by a dragon.
Yeah, like I buy that.
Make believe, yup! They made a secret base and are playing with the egg in it.
Lame.
Man, to be a kid again.
They're all lovey-dovey!
What's the big idea, Mirajane?
You're a really dangerous dude, you know that?
I'd been wondering why she hadn't been home lately...
She was together with Natsu?
How dare she make nice with someone on Erza's side!
What is she talking about?
What do you mean, Erza's side?
So this is where you picked up the egg?
Yeah! It fell down from this tree.
I see...
Whoa!
The vicious monster, Gorian.
Also known as a Forest Vulcan.
And by the way, its favorite food is...
An egg! Hand it over!
What did you say? How about eating some of my fist!
Ooh, that tickles.
Die!
Natsu!
Wait, I'll help!
Get back, Lisanna!
But...
If I'm the dad, then I gotta protect you two, right?
Natsu...
And I'm the son of a dragon!
I can't lose to no monkey, damn it!
Natsu, use magic!
This monkey is fighting with his bare hands, so I'm gonna beat him that way!
Beat me? How?
Bring it on, mountain-monkey!
I'll cover you with white paint and throw you back to Mt. Hakobe!
Now I'm mad!
Natsu!
Yay, yay, yay!
Yay, yay!
Piece of cake...
You're a wreck!
The egg'll get chilled!
Hurry!
Wait, wait!
Come in!
Huh?
Huh? Oh, right...
Wel-come Ho-me!
I-I'm home?
The rain isn't stopping, is it?
Sorry...
So, Natsu... You live by yourself, right?
Yeah.
What do you do for meals?
I eat them at the guild.
Do you pay?
That's why I do work.
I feel kind of sorry for you.
Why?
How about I make something for you?
Wait, you can cook?
Well, not as good as my sister Mira.
Hold it there...
You're saying Mira actually cooks?
I can't even imagine it!
I'll fillet you!
And it sounds dangerous!
Wait, even Elfman?
Yeah!
Cook up nice and tasty...
For some reason, I can see that.
Actually, it fits a bit too perfectly...
I won't give you the egg!
It's gonna hatch!
It's gonna be Igneel's kid!
Don't even joke about cooking it!
Quit jumping to conclusions!
Now look here. I'm also looking forward to when it hatches.
That's why I'm helping you.
What'd you go scarin' me like that for?
I can't wait for it to hatch!
You're usually so out of control, but you can be kind and cute...
Just like Mira!
When we grow up...
What are you talkin' about all of a sudden?
But you seem like you really love children, and you're dependable...
Uh, um...
What're you blushing for? I was just joking, obviously.
You're like that word... You know, that thing Gramps talked about... Coprecious!
Precocious? Aren't you the ignorant one here, Natsu?
I can't beat her in an argument!
How pretty...
I wish this instant would last forever...
It's rattling again!
Yeah!
The egg is gone!
Why?
Who stole it?
The egg's disappeared?
I don't know anything about that.
And... clothes?
Laxus, was it you?!
Not interested.
Out with it, Erza!
Hey, aren't you being presumptuous here?
Mira, do you know where the egg is?
No. Natsu, didn't you eat it yourself?
Hey!
Why, you...
I'll pound ya!
You wanna go?
I ain't gonna hold back!
Natsu, you little...
Stop it, you guys!
There they go again.
That generation's got issues.
I don't wanna think about what the guild's gonna be like in a few years.
They fight because they realize their opponent is worth fighting.
They see themselves clearly reflected in one another.
There is nothing to worry about.
This is stupid.
Where'd my egg go?
Sheesh...
Don't cry, Natsu. Man, you're cute.
I'm not crying!
Now's not the time, Mira!
Don't cry, Natsu.
I said I'm not crying!
Now hurry up and give back the egg already!
I told ya, it ain't me!
Maybe you ate it, pig!
What did you say?
You're always eatin' a ton!
Now that I think about it, Elfman said something about wanting an egg like that.
He ate it?
No! I couldn't believe that...
Natsu, Lisanna, sorry...
It was you, Elfman!
The egg!
I didn't steal it.
It was cold at night, and you toss and turn, so you let go of the egg.
Then...
You mean you...
Right.
I can't use magic very well, but I secretly warmed the egg myself.
So that's what it was.
Thank you!
Elfman, you're a real man!
You accused me!
Well, you accused me, too.
It's hatching!
A cat?!
It's got wings!
A bird?
Isn't it a cat?
A blue cat!
Aye!
It's so cute!
Cute!
A parakeet!
My parakeet is back!
I was pretty sure it was a red parakeet, but...
Look, Natsu... Everyone was so on edge before, but now everyone is happy!
He's like a bluebird of happiness!
Happiness, huh?
Then I'll name him Happy!
Aye!
Happy the dragon!
It's not a dragon...
Guess I'll paint a dragon.
I see.
What a nice story, though.
But now, those two...
The worse they fight, the closer they are, you know?
Hey, Mira! Help me out over here!
Coming!
Um... So this is Erza, and this is Laxus...
That makes this girl Lisanna.
Wait, huh?
Who is Lisanna anyway? I wonder why she's not here anymore?
Fighting again, Natsu?
Oh, Lisanna.
You're back?
Natsu ate all my fish!
Don't say it like I was hogging them all!
Sheesh... You're the dad, right?
You're supposed to protect the mom and the kid, right?
That's from forever ago...
Hey, what are you talking about?
N-Nothing!
We're family, so there'll be times we clash.
But nobody likes fighting.
After all, Happy is our kid, right?
She just said something crazy with a straight face!
Stop talkin' all weird, man!
You'ean'ike dis?
Don't talk while holding your tongue!
You're just as naive as ever.
Don't call me naive!
Man... Guess I gotta...
I've made up my mind.
I'm never speaking to Natsu again!
Hey!
I can't hear you!
Well that's gonna be a problem.
What'll I do with this?
Happy?
Yeah! I'm Happy!
I wonder if they made up?
Ah, well... I guess I'll go check on'em.
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
chasing after your profile left only in my revolving dreams
You said, I never want to see your face again, when you left me
But the tears on your cheek said it all
Every time you felt like you'd be swallowed up in the waves of contradiction
you always held back your tears, you know?
What a strong person, they said, but everyone overestimated you
and before you knew it you lost sight of who you really are
Then the sun I thought would always be near me collapsed
and the light shut off...
Rubbing out the truths and the lies of one day, altogether
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
still, ironically, chasing after your profile in my revolving dreams
Professor Happy's Fairy Tail Lectures!
Today I'll be telling you the secrets behind Wizard Guilds!
In this world there are all kinds of official guilds and dark guilds.
Watch for the guild mark that wizards have somewhere on their body that shows which guild they're from.
And this time will be the final lecture!
Stand, Bow, Aye!
Whoa there... Fairy Tail's all busted up!
This has got to be Erza's doing!
She must have been hungry and run amuck!
Oh! I can believe that.
Aye. It's a miracle that the building's even still standing.
So... maybe we should steer clear for now...
Next time: Phantom Lord!
She's like the shadow ruler of Fairy Tail...
But if one day Erza becomes Fairy Tail's master...
