Erza...
I apologize.
I'd forgotten one crucial thing...
I am not protecting everyone!
T-This is...
It is I... who am always... being protected!
Trust... Bonds...
Their true strength...
It is not One, but Many!
What an amazing guild!
Excellent.
You...
Your body...
Frozen Spirit.
You...
Your body...
A side effect of the Lost Magic, you see.
It seems I overused it considerably...
I will keep my promise.
Everyone's magic power will be returned to them.
Do you know a man by the name of Jellal?
Yes...
He lost his mind after supposedly being possessed by the ghost of Zeref.
A tragic man who traverses a life of nothingness.
He was someone you held dear?
My apologies.
I believe that was all the work of Ultear.
I heard it was an 8-year plan to have the Magic Council turn a blind eye to our actions at the time.
She is a fearsome woman.
Master Hades trusts her more than anyone.
Why are you so fixated on searching for Zeref?
The magic at the beginning of the world...
To get closer to the One Magic.
The One Magic?
And what happens when you get there?
Jellal dreamt of Heaven.
We...
Hey!
The One Magic.
What?
Power is welling up within me!
What's happening?
My body is filling with magic power.
It's coming back!
Yes!
Yeah, it's back.
Our power is back!
Okay!
Back in business!
Go, my babies!
What happened, I wonder?
Anyway, it seems like our magic power is back to normal.
Maybe Carla and the others are late getting here because of what happened?
What happened, Azuma?
Their magic power is back to normal!
With even Gildarts here losing his magic power...
He's not even a match for me...
You got your power back?
As a proctor of this exam, it ain't dignified for me to take a beating like this.
I gotta put on a good show in front of those kids!
Good!
Good, Gildarts!
Let's have a fight where we can fly even higher!
How about we fight seriously now?
Black Hole!
What the...
An infinite gravity well that sucks in everything!
Why, you...
Fly! Fly!
Come forth, Dimguil's Tower!
Blast these foolish Fairies with all that sadness, and return them to dust!
What is this?
I can't move!
Damn it!
Even we are caught up!
Crap...
I don't have a choice.
I'll use my Figure Eyes.
But it won't work on someone with glasses...
Actually...
There's a man I can count on with his eyes wide open!
I'll be controlling you for a bit!
Do it!
Countin' on you!
What?
The spell is broken!
Fried!
Please!
Right!
Cracks?
If you wanna fly so bad, how about I send you flying?
You broke my spell to pieces?
Eh?
Fight for what's right!
The heavens!
Ecriture of Darkness!
Perish!
Looks like your magic power is back to normal...
Ul's... will?
You're free to believe me or not...
I'm taking Zeref and leaving this island.
You... defeat Hades.
With Ul's spell, Iced Shell, you should be able to defeat him.
Please...
You're the only one who can carry out what Ul and I have wished for!
Hurry, hurry!
It's like that weakness from before was just some bad dream...
Just'cause things are a little easier, it's not like we're fully recovered...
Natsu, don't you think you're going a little fast?
We gotta! I have to think of Gramps here!
And I won't know what's happened to everyone else unless we get back to the camp!
I'm so hungry I can't walk!
Look here, li'l kitty. You do understand the situation we're in when you said that, right?
Like they say, care killed the cat.
Actually, I am hungry.
The only thing I ate was the fire from that God Slayer,
and then I beat the crap out of him...
Well, me too. Cana's heavier than you'd think...
Cana's unconscious, but that's still a terrible thing to say...
See? It's not always me!
Everyone, we're in trouble!
I was curious, so I climbed way up high.
The giant tree growing on the island has collapsed down to the roots!
Then that means the felling of the tree was the cause of our magic power drying up?
It is called the Tenrou Tree.
I hear it gives divine protection to those in the guild.
I dunno the details, but anyone who's got a Fairy Tail mark can't die or something.
Then that's why all the injured people made it.
But then, why did our magic power return?
The tree is still toppled...
We cannot relax yet.
Then, we must stay on our guard while our magic power recovers...
All right...
Gray.
Iced Shell requires the caster to give up their life...
I know.
I know full well!
Thank you.
Back off.
This isn't for you, or for Ul.
It's for the guild!
W-What's happened?
Everyone...
Even Gajeel and Mira-san?
I'll use healing magic right away!
Natsu.
Lisanna, you're safe!
Lisanna, thank goodness!
I appreciate the offer, but look at how many...
Don't push yourself, Wendy.
And look here... You've been using magic all day.
You have to rest a little, or else...
I agree!
Lisanna, what happened?
This guy attacked us here.
After that, for some unknown reason, our magic power suddenly disappeared.
It was a close call, but Fried and Bickslow fought for us.
But even before that, everyone had already been injured here and there...
It's gotten so dire without me even realizing it!
Lisanna, don't cry.
The cheerful characters like us can't cry!
Happy...
Y-Yeah...
Unforgivable...
Completely unforgivable...
Natsu...
Natsu-san.
So even the Master and Cana are casualties...
What the hell's goin' on here?
The Grimoire Heart battleship is anchored off to the east.
Considering we need to defend this camp, how about splitting into two teams?
One attack team, and one defense team?
Meldy...
Is that him?
Yes...
This is Zeref.
Change of plans.
We're leaving this island like this.
B-But, I haven't found Gray yet.
Forget about him.
He's not our enemy.
What does Zeref have to do with Ul's wishes?
Listen to me, Gray.
My father was killed by Hades.
In order to get revenge, Ul chased after Grimoire Heart behind the scenes.
After Ul's death, I found her diary and learned the truth.
In order to get revenge, I infiltrated Grimoire Heart.
But, Hades's magic power was beyond anything I could imagine.
Ul knew this, which is why she mastered Iced Shell.
Iced Shell?
I wasn't able to master it.
Even though Ul's blood runs through my veins...
The only magic I know of right now that can defeat Hades is Iced Shell.
Don't worry about Zeref.
I will seal him away, outside this island,
so that no one will ever find him again.
I'm not handing him over to Hades!
Please, you're the only one who can carry out what Ul and I have wished for!
He isn't our enemy.
He's a pawn!
He actually bought that story I came up with on the spot?
Seriously?
If this goes well, then Hades and Gray will off each other!
I couldn't think of anything better!
Even Master Hades?
But, why?
Zeref will be ours alone!
You're going to trick Master Hades?
Gray, Hades... Everyone should just dance in the palm of my hand...
I'm not handing Zeref over to anyone!
He's mine, all mine!
Oh, pardon me...
I really shouldn't put so much confidence in Gray.
But he should at least serve to distract Hades.
Let's leave the island before he catches on.
Right.
Who's this woman?
Juvia.
She and Gray are close.
What are you doing?
I'm going to kill her, obviously.
But, she can't fight any more...
Stay quiet.
I won't let Gray have even a hint of a future.
He will be destroyed by Hades, or die from Iced Shell.
Or even if you manage to survive, you'll have lost your precious friend!
Gray!
I thought as much.
Oh, I'm surprised.
When did you catch on?
I never believed a damn thing you said!
I see.
So, you pretended to believe me in order to find out my true aim...
You naughty boy.
I've decided never to use that magic again!
I stopped you before'cause I didn't want you to die.
Maybe I didn't get through to you?
No matter what Ul wanted...
I have my own will!
I'm going to continue living, along with my friends!
Live...
Sheesh... I guess you're not such a good boy after all.
I had hoped you'd get lucky and get rid of Hades for me...
Honestly, I really didn't want to fight you.
After all, you're one of that woman's beloved pupils...
You've chosen the most painful way to die, you know!
Bring it on, rotten daughter!
I'm gonna teach you a lesson in your mother's place!
About that...
You've made one big mistake.
I am the leader of the 7 Kin of Purgatory!
You don't stand a chance against me!
All right!
We've beaten all the enemies around for now...
Time to take on the bossman!
Sorry to kill your buzz, but you hardly show up next episode.
What?!
The main character doesn't show up? I can't believe it!
That's because you're only just barely the main character, Natsu.
Next episode, I'm the main character!
Next time: Divine Power.
As if.
Jealousy doesn't become you, Natsu...
But seriously, I didn't see a shot with you in the preview...
