The Valliere Sisters

The Spy's Seal
So it exists... it exists...
No, it doesn't...
Y-You...
Dirty dog!
Louise!
Chibi-Louise!
E-Eleonore-oneesama!
Aren't you up early?
That's convenient for me. Pack up already.
Get moving!
You're coming home.
Please hold on, Eleonore-oneesama.
You there. Come with me.
I'll have you be my personal maid until we get home.
Hey! Let go!
What rowdy people.
It's a little tight in here.
Are you all right?
Ah, yes.
There he goes, closing in on her again!
Chibi-Louise! I'm not done talking yet!
I'm sorry, Nee-sama.
You keep looking away, too. Settle down a little.
Because my familiar is...
Geez, this military training and whatnot...
The Magic Academy has degraded.
I can't leave you in a place like that any longer.
Come back home and commit to bridal training instead.
B-But...
But?!
Yes, you mean!
You Chibi!
Chibi-Louise!
Siesta, is something wrong?
You don't seem well these days.
I have... realised Saito-san's true feelings.
You have chosen Miss Valliere...
So, I no longer...
That perverted dog!
This is...
Louise.
Chii-neesama!
She's a hot one...
Also...
It's been a long time, Chii-neesama!
Louise, let me have a good look of your face.
My, you've become beautiful.
Chii-neesama...
Anyway, how have you been?
Thank you for worrying.
Nothing has changed.
Don't worry. It's the usual.
Cattleya.
Where's Mother?
Damn it, I'm hungry, too...
U-Um, Mother...
Mother! Tell Louise for me!
She should stay home from now on!
I bet she's an outcast at school, too.
I-I'm not the same as I used to be!
The Princess...
I'm helping out Her Highness!
She says that she needs my strength.
Your strength?
What could you possibly do when you have zero talent?
Well...
Mother, let's get a groom for Louise already.
How about the second-born son of the Albert family?
Groom?
Why does it turn out that way?
If you're talking about marriage, shouldn't you get married first?
Your engagement with Count Burgundy.
Louise, that topic is...
Chibi-Louise...
To talk back to me with sarcasm...
It sure looks like you attitude has grown bigger!
The engagement has been dissolved!
It's been dissolved!
You got a problem?!
Why?
I don't know. Something like I can't take it anymore.
I wonder why...
Eleonore.
Louise.
We're having dinner right now.
But, Mother!
We shall speak of Louise when Father comes home tomorrow.
So Louise really is a lady from a rich family.
Her world is different from mine.
Besides... besides...
Are they serious about getting her a groom?!
If Saito-san loves Miss Valliere,
I was thinking of giving up on him and stepping out.
However, they don't seem to have made any progress.
As a woman, I'm in an equal position.
Either way, I'm clearly better than her in some categories.
Why is Eleonore-oneesama always mean to me?
She's been like that forever.
She always bullies me.
It's because you're cute.
Because you're cute, she's worried about you.
Because she loves you, she can't stop pestering you.
That's not true.
The same goes for me as well.
Because I love you, I can understand everything about you.
You're at an age of falling in love, right?
I-I'm not in love!
You can't hide it from me.
R-Really, I'm not in love with anyone!
Saito-san. Saito-san.
What's wrong?
Can't get to sleep?
Were you thinking of someone?
Could it be that boy you brought with you?
N-No!
He's only my familiar.
I don't love him at all.
Oh... I never asked if you loved him or not.
Chii-neesama, I hate you.
Oops, she hates me now.
Off you go.
To where you belong.
I-It's not... because I want to meet him.
I'm a mage.
I'm an aristocrat.
It's natural to keep your familiar around you at all times.
I'm going to him since I bet he's worried...
T-That's really all there is to this!
Saito-san...
W-Why are you here?!
Miss Valliere...
Why are you in Saito's...
S-Saito-san...
Saito-san called me.
Yes, he told me... to come to his room tonight.
I came because Saito-san asked me to!
Louise's room is...
Is it this?
Louise?
Louise, right?
About the groom thing you guys were talking about earlier...
I've always wanted to meet you.
I regret having dissolved our engagement.
My dear Count!
Please! Don't say anything and make love to me!
Out of the blue?
Moreover, at your home?
Wait, did she have this much?
You're...!
What's a plebeian doing in my room?
Uh, I went into the wrong room...
I mean, I'm sorry.
Hold it!
Plebeians without manners must be punished.
I-I'm sorry! I won't do it again!
Forgive me!
I won't come close to you ever again!
I wouldn't want to, even if asked to...
What did you just say?
No! My tongue slipped...
Um... ah...
I'm sorry!
Stop!
Louise?
Has Louise returned?
You're late in returning.
Did the military meeting run overtime?
Yes. I must soon leave again.
Military life really is pathetic,
dispatching troops and inflaming the citizens with war.
What a problematic Queen we have.
F-Father! Queen Henrietta isn't aggravating the war at all!
What do you possibly understand?!
Listen, Louise. You do not have to force yourself to learn magic.
Return home and get yourself a groom.
That is the end of this conversation.
Father!
Looks like it's settled.
We should quickly arrange Louise's engagement.
That's the best way to get her settled.
Why? If you're talking about marriage, shouldn't you get married first?
Didn't I tell you that my engagement got dissolved?
I'm sorry!
But I'm not ready to get married yet...
Mother, Nee-sama, you're troubling Louise with this sudden marriage talk.
Louise. Is there someone you're currently in a relationship with?
No! No, I don't! There's no such person!
But it looks like you do have someone on your mind.
No, I don't!
Whom?
Which aristocrat is this?
A count? Or a baron?
Don't tell me he's a baronet or something even lower.
You're joking...
Are you serious?
You've fallen in love with someone of a lower status?
This girl keeps worrying me no matter how old she gets.
I'm not in love with anyone!
Louise!
Damn it, it hurts!
She's so brutal.
I wonder what Louise is doing...
It's open.
May I please come in?
Y-Yes, please.
She looks mature, kind and so soft.
I wonder if Louise will look like this when she grows up...
If so...
Louise will grow to be more attractive than myself.
You see, at this rate, Louise will have to get a groom.
You wouldn't want that, would you?
Louise getting married...
She's in the courtyard, so go to her.
Ever since she was little, she would hide in the boat in the courtyard any time something happens.
If you find Louise, go outside of the mansion.
A horse carriage is waiting for you.
May primogenitor's blessings be upon both you and Louise.
Note: Primogenitor: One's earliest male ancestor.
Please take care of my cute little sister, Knight-dono.
Knight... You mean me?
I'm not in love with anyone, since Saito likes the maid...
He likes her more than me...
Let's go, Louise.
Saito.
Your sister prepared a carriage for us.
Don't bother. I don't care about you anymore.
What are you talking about?
Because... I can't tell my family... about my Void magic.
Nobody gives me credit, no matter how much I try.
I've had it.
Man...
I'll give you credit, then.
I'll assent to everything about you.
So stand up already.
Don't lie to me... when you were the one who called the maid.
Huh?
You prefer her, don't you?
Are you an idiot?
Who are you calling an idiot?!
Who would willingly please a selfish girl like you?
Who would willingly be a familiar for a flat-chested master?
H-How dare you say that!
Yeah, I'll say it as many times as you want.
I don't give a damn about all this war, mission and groom stuff!
Do whatever you want, then!
I love you!
I love you.
Looking at your face makes my heart race.
Isn't that what being in love is?
And yet you blab about maids and whatnot...
Why do you think I risk my life by fighting?
It's because I love you!
I'll kill you if you're lying.
I'm not lying.
W-Wait!
Um... um... um... you see...
Well, anyway, ah...
S-Since you've sworn your loyalty to me by saying that you love your master,
I-I guess you do deserve a reward...
J-Just one spot, okay?
Y-You can touch anywhere you want on your master's body, just one spot.
I'm going to die...
Hey, Saito.
I love you.
No, Saito...
Hey, I said no.
I love you. I really love you.
I seriously love you.
Do you really?
Yeah.
Really? Seriously?
No, you can't...
No, don't rush like that...
Don't be so full of yourself...
I love you, Louise.
I really love you.
Saito.
What are you doing?
Decapitate him.
You were so close, Partner.
Only a step away.
Shut up. We can talk later.
They're handsome guys.
Here I go.
What is he?
He can't be a human.
Please don't worry about Louise, Father!
Don't give me that crap!
Damn, what do I do?
Onee-san...
Saito-san! Hurry!
Siesta!
Let's go.
I can trust what you said earlier, right?
Of course.
Hey, Saito.
Where were you last night?
Um... well...
Is it true that you called her to your room?
Of course not!
Then where were you?
Well, your older sister was...
What?!
You touched Eleonore-oneesama, of all people?
N-No, I had no intention of doing so.
Your sister was the one who jumped me.
Oh, so you did sneak into her room!
Because I mistook her room for yours...
I won't forgive you!
I was a fool for believing you.
You lying dog!
Dirty dog!
Perverted dog!
I-I'm sorry!
I'm the only one who can make Saito-san happy.
Unforgivable. I won't forgive you!
With my womanly charm, I'll beat Miss Valliere.
Hey, are you listening to me?
You stupid dog!
You dog!
What are you investigating so stealthily?
My sister would never steal.
Zero no Tsukaima. Futatsuki no Kishi.
The Spy's Seal.
If you want to meet me again next week, then sit tightly and wait!
