Sorry, but they suddenly
asked me to help out at
the store, so I can't go.
Go on ahead by yourself.

Yeah?
Wanna go somewhere today?

Why can't things go well between
the liar, you, and the crybaby, me?
You don't notice my styled hair
or my nice set of press-on nails.
Love isn't about the unhappy tears that go along with it.
Those tears only leave my eyes dry and hurt me.
I love this destiny
between only you and only me.
I want to accept your hot feelings
and be taken by you forever.
Despite your uncute, tearful face and your shortness, I still love you.
Episode 7...
U-Umm... I was going to an all-you-can-eat cake buffet with Mizu-chin and Taka-chan.
Ah... I see.
She's broke whenever she's with me, and she hates having me pay for her, so she only asks for fruit milk...
Yano!
Mizu-chin
Weren't you guys going to an all-you-can-eat cake place or something?
All-you-can-eat cake?
Ah, yeah, we went last week.
Nana couldn't go, because she didn't have any money or something.
She was pretty green with envy, so why don't you go with her sometime?
Yano, where are you headed? I couldn't get Takeuchi.
Don't follow me.
W-What are you doing?
Can't you tell?
I'm in the middle of...
Huh? For a Christmas present?
Yeah, I thought you'd know what Yano likes, Takeuchi-kun, so I was hoping we could go shopping for a bit.
I'm sure he'd be happy with anything you picked out yourself, Takahashi.
Don't say that!
Please!
Takeuchi-kun?
What? You can't make it? Why not?
I really think Yano will like something you pick out yourself a lot more.
But I have no sense for those things...
Think about it this way. If Yano got you a present...
Which would make you happier?
Well...
Of course, the one that Yano picked out himself...
See?
She's on the move again.
Ah, she slipped.
What's she doing, really?
I could ask you the same question.
What? She must be out buying you a present.
Even though you're penniless...
You big dummy.
So what's going on with Takeuchi?
Ah, he said he had to help out at the store, so he couldn't come.
It's the end of the year, so it makes sense.
I see.
I was just overreacting.
Ah, here she comes.
And she has a bag.
All right!
That ends today's stalking!
I-Idiot! She'll notice us!
I thought you couldn't make it...
I was worried that you might not've been able to get anything.
But I see you did. I'm glad.
That was it. See you later.
Ah! Since you're out this way, wanna get something to drink?
Ah, it's okay. That's really all I came for.
It's so tiny...
I heard from Masa...
That girl who was in the accident last year... she was your girlfriend at that time?
I also heard that you haven't even visited her grave yet, either?
You can't do stuff like that.
Why not?
I'm not saying this for your girlfriend's benefit. I'm saying this for yours.
Go buy some flowers she liked, some water, and get out there, Motoharu.
People need to cry every now and then-
I don't want to hear it!
She was a stupid bitch.
Moto!
Even stupid bitches feel regret.
Even if she does regret it, it's too late!
Closing Ceremonies
Clean-up Snow shoveling
December 24
Hey, boys! Take this seriously!
Don't have a snowball fight!
It's so cold!
Geez! We'll never finish like this!
Yano hasn't looked at me once today.
Is it just my imagination?
It... isn't my imagination!
Yano!
Come on!
What's he so mad about?
Yano!
Takahashi.
Hey, that's stupid. Get up.
Takahashi.
Yano?
Don't screw around like that.
It was obviously a joke...
You're so mean...
I still might not have fully understood Yano at that time...
Yano!
Yano!
There's your Christmas present, you bastard!
I'm sorry...
I didn't do it out of spite...
It's okay. Because you're still alive.
It can be really painful at times...
What could it be?
Umm, I had a really hard time deciding.
Ah, it's a cap.
W-What do you think?
You said you liked hats, and I didn't think you had one with a fuzzy ball on top...
And I had a really hard time picking the colors...
Why would I?
Don't you think it suits me?
It does!
Incredibly...
Then it's fine.
Thank you.
Here's mine, too.
I guess I'll be drinking nothing but fruit milk for a while myself.
You're crying? Doofus.
It's just that...
Everything and anything moves you, doesn't it?
Yeah.
People are always telling me to only cry when I'm sad.
If you have to cry, then I think tears of happiness are a lot better than tears of sadness.
Ever since I met Yano, I've felt that my tears have gotten so much more fragile.
Ah! I left my Math book in my locker!
Huh? Let's go back and get it.
It's such a pain...
Don't say that. We were assigned a ton of homework.
Ah, I'm going to the girl's room for a second, okay?
Yep.
For when I fell down the stairs the other day...
Thank you.
Y-Yeah.
But don't save me ever again.
I don't want to owe you anything.
If you hate me that much, we shouldn't have even gotten to know each other to begin with.
You only used me to get revenge on my sister, anyway.
Revenge?
That wouldn't mean anything, and I'd have no reason to do that.
Don't go giving everything a hidden meaning.
Then, why did you cry back then?
Why did you cry that time?
Yano!
Cry?
Yano cried?
Has something like that ever really happened?
Then, why did you cry back then?
When did this happen?
And in front of Yamamoto-san...
What could make that happen...?
Sorry for making you listen to my problems again.
And we're on winter break, too...
It's okay. I was wondering what was up.
Speaking honestly for a sec, I... can't really believe it.
That he actually cried.
I've known him almost my whole life, but I've never seen him cry or show his soft side.
Yeah, you told me that before, didn't you?
Well, I guess it's because he's human.
Everyone can always do that when nobody else is around...
You can understand, right?
Yeah.
Umm... did something happen between Yamamoto-san and Yano in middle school?
Sometimes, I think there's something strange between them.
Not really. Nothing unusual, at least.
Yamamoto was like that back then, too.
If they seem kind of awkward to you, then isn't it just because...
I wonder why Nana-san was in that car with her ex...
I wonder why she did something like that to betray Yano...
Was her ex really that charming?
No way.
He was the worst.
Everyone was always asking why she was going out with a bum like him.
She was always bruised all over.
Bruised?
Why would she stay with someone like him?
People also always asked Yano, Why are you with someone as stupid as that?
That's just what love is.
I guess...
It's something only those in the relationship could know.
Thanks.
Sorry for calling you out when it's so cold.
Yano and I must really seem like such a stupid couple, too, huh?
Getting everyone involved like this and working ourselves up over every little thing.
Not at all. I think any couple that isn't stupid isn't a real couple anyway.
Takeuchi-kun, when those two first started going out...
Yeah.
It pissed me off... they were so dumb and stupid that I couldn't take my eyes off them.
Ever since the beginning.

Third Quarter Seating Chart
I'm in the front again!
I have no luck with getting seats!
Hey, look.
Geez...
Talk about the worst possible combination.
That seating change was the worst.
I won't be able to leave anything behind now.
Ah, when you forget your textbook, you can ask me for mine.
The person next to me will let me share.
Thanks. And when I start nodding off and it seems like I'm gonna be called on, poke me, okay?
That's a little impossible.
Ah... this will be the second time I'll be sitting next to Yamamoto.
The second time since my second year of middle school.
Really? She didn't share her textbooks then, either?
Ah, yeah. Or... maybe not. I don't think I ever forgot them back then.
What is it?
What happened between you and Yamamoto-san during middle school?
No... it's nothing.
I'm no good. When I think Nana-san's involved, I can't help getting weak in the knees.
Hey, when you went to get my present did you try to buy it with Takeuchi?
Yeah.
Why did you lie and say you were going to an all-you-can-eat cake buffet with Mizu-chin?
Lie...? I just wanted to surprise you.
I know...
I know, but...
Don't lie to me if you're going to be meeting with another guy.
I don't want any secrets between us.
Promise me that you'll never ever betray me.
Yeah.
English
What page are we working on today?
Let me see!
Isn't it kinda harsh to be sitting next to Yamamoto-san?
Asahi Middle School
She doesn't say anything.
She scowled at me the other day.
It's kinda hard to ask her to see her textbook, huh?
I hope they change seats soon.

Let me see your textbook.
It's hard to see from here, so could you put it between our desks?
Open to page 45.
Ah, sorry.
Why are you working ten pages ahead?
There's nothing else to do at home.
There's nothing else to do, so you study?
You sure are different.
Study hall!! Keep quiet.
I'd sure like some money right about now.
You shouldn't talk about your unrealistic dreams.
I have dreams!
If I were rich, we could go on a date at Disney Land!
What about you, Yano? What would you do if you were rich?
Me?
I don't need money.
I don't need any money, but instead... I want love.
What's wrong with me, wishing to be rich?
Yano, don't worry! I'll give you as much love as you want!
Really?
Yeah!
Then, why don't you come over on Saturday? My parents won't be around.
So love meant the perverted stuff to Yano...
Sign: Slurp
Yano... in that case, want to come over my place on Saturday?
Huh? Your parents won't be around?
They will.
Then that's no good.
Yano.
Yes?
Is that all you think about?
Yes.
You're such a moron.
I'm sorry, Yano. I can't live up to your expectations.
My heart hurts, too.
Ah, check it out!
They look just like you, Takahashi.
Should I give it a whirl?
Huh? I thought you were broke.
This is my entire life's savings.
Here we go.
As long as Yano smiles back at me, that's all I need.
Ah, that yellow one is cute.
I should just put my other worries to rest.
I want Yano... to always smile.
Huh? I don't have my biology textbook.
Even though I somehow managed to bring it home, I guess I forgot to bring it back.
You're such a doofus. Want to borrow mine?
Ah... sure.
Biology
No, never mind.
On second thought...
Let me see yours, Yamamoto.
Thank you.
What is it?
N-Nothing! B-Bye bye!
What do I want...?
Yamamoto-san sure was nice, showing you her textbook.
Ah... yeah.
Yano, wanna come to my house on Sunday?
It should be convenient for you, since it's Sunday.
Are your parents going to be out or something?
Yeah.
H-Hello.
It's kinda cramped in here, but...
You... knew from the very beginning, didn't you?
Whatever are you talking about?
It's smaller than your room, but...
Oh. You can put your bag down over there.
Yano's in my room!
I'm... a little moved by it all.
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
So, where do you live?
Yanagimachi.
It must've taken you a while to get here, then.
Not at all. I just have to take one bus.
Mom and Yano are talking...
You're so handsome. Your class must really talk about you.
It feels so weird.
Ah, no... not at all.
Mother in the middle of appraisal
Ah, geez... I'm starting to feel bad for Yano.
What does your father do for a living?
I told you, he's involved with realty. Umm, Yano's house is really huge!
Really? And just when did you pay them a visit?
Crap!
Takahashi, that house isn't as big as you think it is.
You've never come in, but my room is only four and a half tatami mats.
O-Oh? Is that so?
My. I see.
S-Should I play a CD? What do you wanna listen to?
Anything's fine.
I knew it... it's totally different from meeting with him outside.
I'm so nervous!
Someone save me from this silence!
I'm not gonna do anything, so calm down.
After all, it seems like your mom would just walk in without knocking.
H-How rude!
She wouldn't do anything like that!
Please have some more tea.
Sorry.
For what?
A lot of things.
Don't worry about it. You're just being treated preciously.
Yano, I really, really love you.
I feel like I've learned so much more about you since we started dating!
Like?
Like? Like...
You can be a bigger doofus than I thought.
Like your more childish aspects...
And how you brush my hair like this...
I just keep falling more and more in love with you.
I'm jealous of Yamamoto-san.
Of Yamamoto-san, who knows more about the unknown Yano than me.
I want to be the closest one to Yano.
I want to know more and more about him.
I want to know everything.
Is it selfish of me to want that? I wonder...
Yano, umm...
You said before that there'd be no secrets between us, right?
Yeah.
I'll never lie to you ever again.
So don't lie to me either, okay?
Yeah.
Would you tell me...
I'm sure it's all just in my head...
Yano?
Why?
Why what?
For the same reason you have.
It's making me uneasy.
There aren't going to be any secrets between us, right?
Yano...
Yano?
Why won't you answer me?

I feel like the seasons have changed slightly
and the sunbeams have thinned and will one day shift.
But I was relieved, knowing our bus
was riding through our unchanged city.
You always gaze up to me from outside my window
and I mimic you by doing the same
like always.
Hey, I wonder if we're both the same?
Even if the place we want to go to has gotten dull, it's all right.
Hey, I wonder if we're both the same?
I still feel love for you, but you're no longer looking at me.
Episode 8 Preview...
Yamamoto-san loved you?
I don't care whether Yamamoto loved or hated me.
It has nothing to do with me. Not interested one bit.
I saw you two go home together that day.
How could you do it with her little sister?
Come with me, Takahashi!
It's fine with me...
