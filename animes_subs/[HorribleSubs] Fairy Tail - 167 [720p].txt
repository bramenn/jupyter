Um...
You're challenging 100?! That's impossible!
It isn't set up for one person to destroy them all!
I don't care.
The competition for day three is Pandemonium.
It's a contest to see who can slay the most out of 100 magic-generated monsters.
The contestants enter one at a time
and indicate the number of monsters they aim to defeat.
They get points by successfully beating the beasts.
The idea is to repeatedly rotate through the players, but...
All 100 will be my opponents!
I exercise my right to challenge...
This beyond-foolhardy challenge is about to begin.
100 to 1!
Erza!
The inside is pretty big...
But it's upside down...
It makes me sick just lookin' at it!
I'm Erza Scarlet from Fairy Tail A.
I challenge 100.
A bunch have come out...
Even the D-class ones looked really strong, right?
Does she really mean to take all of them on by herself?
She does. Erza means it.
I can understand.
Natsu, you seem to be having fun.
Maybe you were a better fit for this than that Chariot event.
Will Erza-san be alright?
I'm sure she'll get through it.
Well, it should be a spectacle, anyway.
She's as reckless as always...
She hasn't changed a bit in the past seven years.
Requip!
Heaven's Wheel!
Blumenblatt!
Whoa! Erza has carried out a preemptive strike with an omni-directional attack!
The D-class monsters are dropping one after another!
Was she trying to demolish them all at once?
No.
By doing an omni-directional attack,
she learned the responses, the abilities, and the defensive capabilities of each type.
Also, in an instant, she was able to calculate which armor to use
against each kind of monster.
Her attacking power has improved!
Black Wing Armor!
With each strike, its power increases!
Then she's starting out by reducing their numbers with sheer force, huh?
Erza-san!
It breathes fire!
No worries! If the enemy's fire...
Oh, that's right! She's got Flame Empress Armor!
She brushed the flames aside!
What is that?!
A weapon that's part of a set with her Sea Empress Armor!
Water against flames, right?
Oh, my! She's destroyed five C-class monsters already!
Uh-oh! What's this?!
A fire and water dual-sword technique?
But it also looks like she took some damage...
So you're S-class...
No, that's not right.
She returned fire against the water enemy with Sea Empress Armor and a lightning attack!
Correct!
Fast judgment...
And the confidence to back it up...
She's a wonderful wizard, isn't she?
Th-This is awesome!
She's already cut down half of the monsters!
Seriously?!
That's Erza for you.
Her every move is polished, with not a movement wasted.
I wonder if Sho and Wally are watching, too...
Nonsense!
Is this really anything to make a fuss about?!
Look at her! She's all beat up!
It does look like she's exhausted...
Go, Erza! Smash'em to pieces!
I don't know...
It looks like she's kind of having a hard time...
Oh, boy! Even wounded, Erza smoothly dispatched a succession of monsters,
but now she's facing an A-class monster!
That looked like a heavy hit!
Ah! Hit that badly...
No. Just the opposite. I believe she used its weight.
The terrifying Titania!
She requips over and over,
steadily crushing the monsters!
While she's taken damage and depleted a lot of her magic,
unbelievably... just four monsters are left!
But those are all strong ones!
And she hasn't defeated the S-class monster yet...
S-class, my ass!
We know just how awesome S-class Erza is!
Hey, she...
And finally... And finally, the last one!
Just what kind of monster is an S-class one?!
Uh... Huh?
I thought so.
So you're the S-class, huh?
What?!
It's tiny!
What a cute monster-san!
Still, I have a bad feeling about this...
Huh? Why is Erza-nee changing her sword?
From Benizakura to two swords?
Against that puny foe?
Something must be up...
Yeah. Look at her expression.
Her concentration and sense of tension have doubled!
Come.
This is why I told you it was impossible-kabo!
It's set up so that when the S-class monster
becomes the last one left, its power triples-kabo!
Alright! Pandemonium's last monster!
But somehow the battle has moved to the arena!
The now super-sized S-class monster is bearing down on Erza!
Who knew they set it up like this?
An unexpected ambush...
I see. Fitting for a place called Pandemonium...
Go! That giant thing is no match for you, Erza!
The third day of the Grand Magic Games...
Pandemonium.
I don't think I'll ever forget this day...
Even while being badly wounded,
a fairy that should've fallen to the ground...
Titania...
Here you are.
Just like...
U-Unbelievable!
Amazingly, Erza has obliterated 100 monsters all by herself!
Erza Scarlet of Fairy Tail A has scored a resounding victory!
Without any question, a tremendous win!
Is this the true strength of the guild that was called the most powerful
seven years ago?!
A-Awesome!
What is she?!
I remember her!
Fairy Tail's strongest woman wizard, Erza Scarlet!
Yeah, Titania! Erza!
The cheering just won't stop!
I give up...
I don't have the words...
Her rash action...
I couldn't see that it would lead to this...
Erza!
Guys...
Sorry.
It took longer than I thought it would.
Ow!
You were great!
Fight me later!
I was moved!
I've got a lump in my throat...
Come on... It's not like we won the tournament yet.
Excuse me...
You said it took longer than you thought it would?
Nobody holds a candle to her.
Er-chan really is the most powerful!
The spiffiest and most powerful!
I should've expected no less of Ichiya-san's girlfriend...
She blazes as brightly as the sun!
I guess seeing that makes a guy say reckless things!
Marvelous.
I don't like this...
Erza! Erza! Erza! Erza!
Erza! Erza! Erza! Erza!
I knew you could do it, Erza!
Erza! Erza! Erza! Erza!
Yay!
I-I love you!
Fairy Tail has been booed since day one!
But this wild applause makes that almost hard to believe!
After seeing her, anybody would applaud...
To be honest, I was moved as well.
The seven years that were lost...
Yeesh...
It looks like I don't have to worry about it anymore...
Th-That's no big deal! We could've done the same thing!
F-Fro thinks so, too...
Interesting.
I suppose you aren't all talk,
Fairy Tail...
She's incredible...
I've never seen anything like that before...
I guess they don't call her Titania for nothing...
Erza Scarlet...
You know Jellal well...
Pandemonium has been conquered!
Fairy Tail A receives ten points!
After some discussion, it's been decided that the other seven teams need to be ranked,
so this is somewhat of a drag, but a simple game has been prepared.
What is this?
A Magic Power Finder!
In short, MPF!
A device to measure magic...
Exactly.
When this machine is hit with magic, the magic power will be displayed as a numeral value.
Those values will be ranked, from high to low.
A simple test of strength, huh?
I'm at kind of a disadvantage here...
By the way, Cana-san, are you free tonight?
I'm free, but I don't think I'll be able to drink more than one barrel...
You drink too much!
That's an understatement!
That drunk!
That's no good...
Cana-san! The competition isn't over yet!
Alright, let's begin!
We'll go with the order that was decided before-kabo!
Then I'm up first!
Here I go!
Oh, my! Under the cloak is a daring outfit!
Kitten Blast!
The value is 365!
But that being said,
without a benchmark to compare it to, we don't know if this is a high score or not...
We Rune Knights also use the MPF as part of our training.
This number is a high score.
A level high enough to make someone a captain.
Then that's an impressive figure, isn't it?!
Feelin' spiffy!
Although Millianna's real strength isn't about power...
She may be at a disadvantage here...
Next is Quatro Puppy's Novale!
His value is 124! Seems a little low...
It's my turn, huh?
This is a tough one for Hibiki, whose magic is the intellectual type.
I should've done this one...
Believe in your friend, you two.
Master! When did you get here?!
So you're back in action, huh, senpai?
Jenny passed me the baton.
Hibiki of Blue Pegasus! His magic power is 95...
That's terrible...
Is this what we get for believing in him?
Men... But there's a lot to learn from failure.
You can take this and strive to do better, for example.
Right! Your words are sweet music to our ears, Sensei!
He's already striving...
Want me to comfort you tonight?
Um...
I want you to baby me now...
Next up is Obra of Raven Tail!
That's the guy...
Right...
Raven, huh?
I wonder what kind of magic he'll use...
What the...?! His magic power is 4!
Is he just messin' around?
What's with that guy?!
And shouldn't you be in the infirmary?
That's a little unfortunate, but there are no do-overs here-kabo...
Um, excuse me...
Jeez! Obra, what the hell are you doing?!
Are you an idiot?!
Silence, Flare.
His magic can't be shown in front of people.
Y-Yes, sir.
He's a guy who's gotta be forced to get serious.
Alright,
currently the top score is 365 from Millianna of Mermaid Heel-kabo!
Yay! I'm number one!
We'll see about that...
Sabertooth's Orga takes the field!
Listen to those cheers!
Orga-kun! Please win this thing!
Orga's strong, isn't he?
120mm Black Lightning Cannon!
O-Over 3,000?!
Ten times my score?!
Wha...?!
What the hell is that?!
Wow...
I've never seen a score like that, not even in my Corps!
That's Orga-kun! When it comes to power, he's the strongest!
Fro thinks so, too!
The strongest, the strongest, number one!
We don't need to hear any more singing-kabo...
Our guild, Sabertooth, kicks the ass of everyone!
Alright, can Jura, one of the 10 Great Wizard Saints, surpass this score?
He's got everyone's attention!
Jura-san will win, won't he?
Of course. I'm concerned about something else.
Do you mind if I do this seriously?
Go right ahead-kabo!
It appears that Jura of Lamia Scale is concentrating!
An earthquake!
We're feeling tremendous pressure...
Rumbling Mt. Fuji!
8,544! Unbelievable!
What?!
Old man, that's wack!
In a word, unsurprising.
Those nicknamed the 10 Great Wizard Saints
are just so powerful. Shouldn't their participation be limited?
I see. So that's what you're worried about, Lyon.
Th-This is a new record for the MPF!
The title 10 Great Wizard Saints isn't just for show!
This blows me away...
He's probably evenly matched with Gildarts...
Don't forget that someone who shares Gildarts' blood is right over there.
And our final challenger is Cana Alberona of Fairy Tail B!
So it's finally my turn?
I'm sure it's tough to follow Jura, but...
Well, just do your best-kabo.
She's smashed...
Is she gonna try to get into the thousands in that state?
I predict in the high hundreds for a third place finish...
But why is she stripping?!
Alright, I'm gonna hit you hard!
That emblem!
D-Don't tell me...
I lent it to her just this once...
Gather!
River of light that guides fairies!
In the first place, that woman
has incredibly high latent ability.
So I'm sure she'll be able to master this.
Shine! To destroy the fangs of evil!
Fairy Glitter!
That Cana possesses one of the Three Great Fairy Magics?
O-Oh my goodness!
The MPF is destroyed! The counter's stopped!
What is this guild?!
It's a one-two finish for the competition part!
Can anyone stop Fairy Tail now?!
We're unstoppable!
It's because we're Fairy Tail, see?!
I need to think a bit-kabo...
Alexei-sama...
Here's the list of battle matches...
This match-up...
The management is well-informed.
Shall we begin?
For the sake of our true purpose...
F-F-Feelin' spiffy!
What are you doing?
I thought up a Mini Anna cheer song!
Natsu, it's Millianna, not Mini Anna!
And she's on a rival team!
Well, I could go on, but first off, why a song?
I'm sick of cheering the usual way.
Next time: Laxus vs. Alexei!
I am the king of crackling lightning...
Don't tell me that's your cheer song for Laxus?!
