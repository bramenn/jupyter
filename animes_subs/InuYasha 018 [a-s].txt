Ugh!
Die Inuyasha!
In order to become a full-fledged demon...
the half-demon Inuyasha required fragments of the Sacred Jewel.
But someone tricked Inuyasha and Kikyo...
into hating each other and fighting.
The demon behind this cruel scheme...
was Naraku.
Why did you betray me, Inuyasha?!
W-wha!
So if you keep gathering these Sacred Jewel fragments...
you'll come across Naraku?
I'm gonna avenge Kikyo's death... I'll find him and send him to hell!
We got a good haul today, Chief!
Look at these bales of rice!
For a puny village, they sure had a hoard.
Let's hurry, Chief.
Demons are supposed to appear around here after dark.
Can't be a mercenary if you're'fraid of demons!
- Chief look! - Huh?
That's a mere mortal.
Interesting armor he's got.
Kill'im and strip'im!
Well done!
You are the one and only Lord Sesshomaru!
Slaying that blue demon and taking his arm was a splendid idea!
Are you blind?
This is already useless!
Oh... gone bad again?
Arghhh!
Find a demon with a more suitable arm.
Or else... I'll kill you!
Arghhh!
And it's all the fault of that Inuyasha...
for cutting off Lord Sesshomaru's arm.
Die!
No... I don't hate that sword.
Just that half-demon Inuyasha!
The Tetsusaiga belongs with Lord Sesshomaru!
We will take it back from Inuyasha without fail!
Even if I find another arm, it'll be useless after a while.
You seem to be troubled.
Pardon me, but are you Inuyasha's elder brother, Sesshomaru?
Who are you?
Like you, I despise Inuyasha.
It was rude of me, but I overheard you talking.
May I suggest that you use this arm?
Don't jest! That's a human arm!
Precisely.
However, it's not JUST a human arm.
It's a human arm with a Sacred Jewel fragment imbedded in it.
A Sacred Jewel fragment?
This arm will empower you...
to wield the Tetsusaiga, Inuyasha's fabled sword.
The Tetsusaiga is known as the protector of humans.
Presently, a demon like you cannot touch the Tetsusaiga.
Humph... You mentioned that you hate Inuyasha.
Do you intend to use me to kill Inuyasha?
- Exactly. - How dare you?!
Interesting. I'll take the arm.
Lord Sesshomaru!
One more thing...
This hive.
I'm sure it'll come in very handy.
Tell me your name.
It is Naraku.
Naraku? I shall remember it.
I'm so glad we're not sleeping in the forest!
We get to eat a hot meal and sleep under a roof! Heaven!
Well, excuse me for making you sleep in the wild so often!
Inuyasha, you take offense so easily these days.
Hate the fact that it was Miroku who got us shelter here, huh?
Soft, fluffy beddings are sooo nice!
That should do it.
Now the ominous black clouds that hover over this mansion...
will disappear for good.
Thank you so much, Lord Monk!
My goodness! When you came suddenly and informed me...
that there were evil clouds overhead...
I was so afraid of what might happen!
But now that you have exorcised this place...
I can put my fears to rest.
It's just part of a monk's duty.
Oh... such bliss! Such bliss!
Thank you for the food!
Finished with the exorcism?
Now then, I can rest.
Hey Miroku... Something still bothers me.
Yes?
When we're desperately looking for a place to sleep...
you suddenly see a black cloud over the finest mansion in the area.
How did that happen, I wonder?
Huh? Why bring that up now?
You know the saying, A lie is sometimes expedient.
W-what?!
Lie? Was the black cloud a lie?
I figured it was a lie.
W-what a shyster!
Oh yes! He gave me a gift of dumplings, too.
Yea!
Hey, don't look so happy!
Calm down.
W-what's that?
Aghh! It's coming this way!
Something big is coming.
Let's run!
W-why you! Can't just eat and run!
But it's big! We're no match for it.
Impossible! Stupid! Like committing suicide!
What a guy!
I sense Sacred Jewel fragments.
It's heading this way with enormous speed!
A Sacred Jewel fragment coming here?!
What luck!
If it's the Sacred Jewel, I'm willing to make the sacrifice!
Hold it, Miroku!
What's that sound?
That trembling!
W-what!?
Sesshomaru!
Slow as usual, huh, Inuyasha?
Damn you, Sesshomaru! Whaddya want?
Don't ask me stupid questions.
I'm here for the Tetsusaiga!
You still haven't given up?!
Are they acquaintances?
That's Inuyasha's older brother.
Brother?
Unlike half-demon Inuyasha, this one's a full-fledged one.
He's still after the Tetsusaiga.
He couldn't become one with the sword...
and couldn't even lift it!
That's right! He shouldn't be able to touch it even now!
Draw your sword, Inuyasha.
Or will you hand it over quietly?
Shaddup! This time, I'll cut off more than your arm!
Inuyasha... You still haven't mastered the use of the Tetsusaiga.
W-what?!
Cut your jokes, damn you!
Such pitiful swordsmanship...
You can't handle that large sword.
Arghhh!
His arm is rotting!
It's the poison in his nails!
If you don't release the Tetsusaiga, your arm will rot and fall off.
Damn!
Before that happens!
He's resisting him!
I'll slit you in half!
Damn him...
Damn!
What?!
Sesshomaru has a hold of the Tetsusaiga!
W-why is Sesshomaru able to hold the Tetsusaiga?
I shall show you, Inuyasha...
The Tetsusaiga's true power.
Jaken!
Yes, my lord! I shall summon all the mountain demons!
Come forth!
Watch me well, Inuyasha.
In one stroke...
The power to slay a hundred demons in one stroke...
W-what?!
The mountain...
Not only the demons, he destroyed the mountain!
Now that is the true power of the Tetsusaiga...
the supreme sword forged from our father's fang!
Unfortunately, it does not have the power to choose his owner!
Do you realize now that a half-demon like you...
can never master it?
D-damn!!
Inuyasha!
Hold it, Kagome!
I'll go!
Shippo, stay behind, too!
Then... your right hand!
Become a victim of the Tetsusaiga...
That's a fitting end for you.
As if I'd let someone like him take the Tetsusaiga!
I can't stay quiet any longer.
Enough of this silly sibling rivalry.
Hey!
Hmmm? That monk?
Stay back, Miroku!
You can't handle this alone!
Shaddup! Get behind me!
Don't be so stubborn!
W-what?! You!
Is that the monk that Naraku mentioned?
There should be a young monk with Inuyasha.
He may prove to be more troublesome than Inuyasha.
Aghh!
Sesshomaru, leave this monk to me!
No sense in wasting your time with him.
That's true. I'll just watch.
Onward! Smash them!
Everyone, get back!
Heaven's wrath!
N-no-o... Stop!
Heavenly power! It's the Wind Tunnel!
Miroku, you look great!
Inuyasha, you too.
Don't say it like an afterthought.
Please try using this...
It is the hive of the Saimyosho, the insect of Hell.
You will find this very useful...
in plugging the Wind Tunnel in that monk's right hand.
Humph... We'll see if he was right.
W-what's?
Those bugs...
They're not being sucked in, they're flying at him!
They're!
Inuyasha... Take over!
- Miroku! - What's wrong, Miroku!
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!
Are you all right, Miroku?
I've been poisoned by those insects...
Poison?
Foxfire!
Shippo!
I can fight these bugs at least!
Shippo!
Miroku!
Wait here, I'll look for an antidote!
Inuyasha! Help Miroku!
Hey, Miroku! Do your share!
Sorry, Inuyasha... The poison's weakened me...
I can't believe those petty insects shut down my Wind Tunnel...
Blades of Blood!!
C'mon, Miroku! Get your ass over here!
Damn... He said something about poison...
Is it fatal?!
He's coming!
How hopeless he is.
Damn it! What do I do?!
One swing of the Tetsusaiga, and we're done for!
This is it.
Die!
This is it.
Die!
You are such a fool!
You can run and hide.
That would totally be expected of you.
Living in this world only adds to your disgrace.
Will you shut up?!
Getting a hold of one sword sure loosened your mouth!
Well, lemme tell you something.
When you kill someone, make sure you do it right!
Otherwise, you may just end up...
eating your words!!
I've had just about... enough!
He's resisting the Tetsusaiga!
That's the sheathe of the Tetsusaiga!
I was just about to be killed by Lord Sesshomaru!
Even more than the monk's heavenly power...
Lord Sesshomaru's disregard for ally or foe when he kills...
is a hundred-fold more frightening.
Oh dear... I fear for the future.
You!
Something really bothers me.
We have never met, yet it's as though you had those insects just to trap me.
What's going on?!
Huh?! Well... err...
Miroku!
A weak monk and a puny fox-child...
I, Jaken, can handle you alone!
You hope to resist me with a sheathe, huh?
Well, this is no ordinary sheathe!
You'll soon see... when I crack open that head of yours!
Stupid things!
Illusory Top!
Fool!
Dang it! My power isn't enough...
Go, Shippo! Never mind me!
Miroku!
The sheathe, huh?!
What sheathe?!
One swing... Just one more swing.
Huh?!
The Tetsusaiga's transformation has been cancelled!
Sesshomaru!
The next one is aimed at your heart!
Kagome!
Inuyasha... Make your escape! Hurry!
That young woman's arrow reverses the Tetsusaiga's transformation.
Could Kagome really be the reincarnation of the priestess?
The Wind Tunnel is shut down. And the Tetsusaiga has been stolen!
Sesshomaru has Inuyasha backed into a corner!
The Sacred Jewel burst forth from my body...
so maybe I can summon the special powers...
like the priestess, Kikyo!
We combined forces to fight! So Inuyasha, what's the problem?!
Next on Inuyasha, Go Home to Your Own Time, Kagome!
Don't miss it!
