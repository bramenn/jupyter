Biba-sama!
Lord Liberator!
Long live Biba!
You know what, brother...
He said he did the operation himself.
Weird guy, right?
He did it himself?
That's impressive.
Biba Amatori-sama, I presume.
I am Ayame, heir to the Yomokawa family.
Yomokawa?
Then you are the elder's...
Elder Dogen Makino is my uncle.
They're all going to Diamond Citadel too, brother.
We owe Nameless -san a great deal.
I had no idea she was your sister.
Oh, she is not my sister.
Huh?
He just lets me call him brother.
Ikoma!
Brother, this is the guy.
He's my shield.
So you are the Iron Fortress's Corpseless.
I am
I know who you are.
You are the one who taught Nameless... that the weak are expected to die.
Hey, Ikoma!
Nameless, why don't you visit the Sickbay?
Have your body inspected.
Okay.
It is a bit loud here.
Would you like to talk inside?
Ikoma-kun, you as well.
Are you human or a Corpse?!
I'm neither!
I'm a Corpseless!
I am humbled.
To have the Warlord's son guide us himself...
I have already been disowned.
I am no longer my father's son.
Oh, but...
Stay back.
What is it?
Biba-sama.
Well, there is a leak, and we're unable to build pressure.
We have been fighting constantly after all...
I'm sure it must have come loose.
Do you have a wrench?
No, you mustn't, you will get dirty.
Fighting Corpses is dirty work.
Udo, you shovel the coal.
Yes, sir.
Fireless, please go on ahead with Ayame-sama.
Yes, sir.
This way, please.
Shall I help?
You might need filler.
I have some on me.
Yes, I'd appreciate it.
Please wait here.
Okay.
What's this?
This is no place for a princess.
I'll take your sword.
We have been invited by your lord.
I have no reason to hand over my sword.
I wasn't going to need it for long.
What?
What is the meaning of this?!
Don't get me wrong.
Let's all be friends here.
Friends.
Ikoma-kun...
The strong survive and the weak die.
Do you not believe that this is how the world works?
But...
I fully understand that.
However...
I'm talking about saving them.
Nameless saved herself by choosing to fight.
What do you mean?!
What is important for survival...
It is to stand up and fight the Corpses.
Am I wrong, Ikoma-kun?
Look at those numbers...
Can we really stop... all of them?!
They brought the Corpses here on purpose to put our people in danger...
Do not worry.
The Beaters will take care of the Corpses.
I'm sure the Liberator himself will join the battle.
And when he does...
The west gate!
Hurry!
What will you do, Ikoma-kun?
I will fight!
I see.
Then I shall see you out on the battlefield.
Yes!
So they've come.
How many?
Seven hordes.
They have spread out in front of the wall.
There's no danger of a hybrid colony here.
Fifteen minutes is all we need.
Just enough for one canister.
We will deploy with light arms.
After you slow them with cannon fire, we will clean them up.
Understood.
Forge by fire, prove in combat!
We can't use the Guardian Cannon because they're too close!
Be careful!
I will!
In the end...
That's Biba's Railfort!
Incendiary bomb!
Fire!
All hands... charge!
Amazing...
They went to face them outside the walls...!
That's right.
If you want to defeat the Corpses...
A stray Corpseless?
My guess would be that he has a high pain threshold.
Take care of everyone...
Brother, let me!
Okay, take care of it Nameless.
Fireless, give her a hand.
Yes, sir.
Another Corpseless?!
Enoku, huh?
It's begun.
You do not know...
I am here after having met some of them face-to-face.
I am to kill you at the first opportunity!
I see.
I can tell you where they are.
All you must do... is ask it of me.
Give me the order here... and I shall do as you bid!
I have no need of you.
Be gone.
Is that...
H-Help me!
You lied to me.
You already decided you would betray me.
You are weak.
Stop!
Why... did you kill him?!
He asked for help!
Ikoma!
Leave it to the commander.
Is this man your blood?
Perhaps a long-lost brother?
No!
Then why are you so upset over a man you barely know?
Because he was asking for help!
Stop it, you idiot!
Biba-sama was the one in danger!
I'm so sorry.
I promise I will talk to him.
I would also like to offer my apologies.
It is just as we feared!
If Biba could be killed by some assassin...!
Who goes there?!
Please come with me.
I'm sure he only felt sympathy for him.
Please forgive him.
Very well.
In any case, it seems there is still much danger.
If you would like, we could accompany your Iron Fortress to Diamond Citadel.
We can rest easy knowing Biba-sama will protect us.
Yes.
We've all but made it to Diamond Citadel.
Is it really that easy?
Did I make the right decision?
It will reduce the Corpses threat.
Is there something that bothering you?
No.
So, what's bothering you so much?
He taught Nameless that the weak are expected to die!
He's not exactly wrong.
And Nameless said that she's never been bitten by a Corpse before!
Doesn't that mean...
Let's talk outside.
Fight.
If you want to live...
That's right.
Your mother...
Live on your own.
Do not rely on others.
You no longer need a name for people to call you with.
From this day forth you will be Nameless.
You will be Mumei, the one without a name.
Indeed the bruise is quite large...
Are you afraid?
No, I'm fine.
We're so close to getting you back to your home.
You're strong, Nameless.
Perhaps I could ask you to do one thing for me then.
What did you say, brother?
Get the Iron Fortress's master key for me.
But Ayame-san has the master key!
Is this Ayame-san...
No.
She's not, but...
Then... there shouldn't be an issue.
L-Lord Biba!
What is this place?!
What are you going to do with us?!
I have not forgotten what I've done.
That is why you tried to kill me.
I only have one thing to ask you.
Who left us on that battlefield 10 years ago...
You were... in charge of supplies at that time, so you should know.
Stop!
Do not lay a hand on Hirotsuka-sa
Would you like...
I-It wasn't me!
It was the Warlord!
Don't kill me!
What is it?
It's the Corpses!
The Corpses are here!
Over there!
On the Master Fortress?!
There are a lot of them!
What are they doing...
Nameless -san?
Do you need something?
Yes.
Give me...
What?
The master key.
The one you have.
Why do you need the master key?
Are you not going to give it to me?
Are you going to use it?
Or did someone ask you to get it for them?
Enough questions, just hand it over!
Nameless -san...!
You won't be able to beat me... Ayame-san.
So just...
I have the master key here.
What?
I was using it for some coupling work I was doing.
May I hand it to her?
What? Yes...
Thank you.
Yukina-san, what did you hand her?
The key to the boiler room.
In any case, why would she need the master key?
I can't imagine it was Nameless -san's idea...
Ayame-sama!
Please come with me!
It's Ikoma!
Huh? A fake?
This key is to the boiler room.
That can't be!
Because!
They lied to you.
Unfortunately...
Commander.
The Corpseless man is at the freight car.
Open this!
Is nobody here?!
Ikoma?
Nameless.
If he forces his way in here...
I know.
I'll turn him away.
Why are you here?
Nameless... you have to come back to the Iron Fortress with me.
I have to ask you something!
There he is!
Let's trust him.
Biba is hiding a horde of Corpses on the Master Fortress!
You must have heard it too.
You mean the Sickbay?
You knew about it?!
It's because we have to know our enemy.
Did they use that technology...
That's right.
I asked my brother to turn me into a Corpseless.
Why would you do that?!
It's because brother told me...
To become strong!
It was the only way for a child like me to become strong...
Do you still want to talk about this?
It's not like you'd ever understand.
No!
You shouldn't be in a place like this!
Stop!
I am staying with my brother!
Why does he use his power to kill people?!
It's... something a coward who's scared of dying does!
You don't know anything about my brother!
So watch what you say!
Nameless!
Trying to protect yourself is not being a coward.
There won't be any more reason to be sad if we all just become strong.
What my brother says is right.
Not that I expect liars like you to understand!
Wait, Nameless!
Don't go!
Biba...
He's no hero.
At that time...
I will remember that day
Losing myself
In steam
Countless mistakes are made
When I can't see anything ahead
You said
Ask your own burning blood
Answer my beat
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress
Stand up
And slam everything onto the ground
My soul is devoted to my friend
Burn your life
Change the world
Even if the stars
That connect you make a sound
There are just dreams in the same rain
And lights are dried up
I am tired of getting answers
By mimicking others
Dawn without the sun
And broken morning
Smashed cry and dream The ideal only has its doors
City is uplifted and drown in noise
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder
To hush silence
Chapter Eight
The Silent Hunter
