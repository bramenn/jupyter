The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Oh, yeah! Can you hear this voice?
Oh, yeah! It's hoarse from yelling.
Oh, yeah! Until your heart can hear it...
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
The moon and sun high-five.
Are you sure you're not forgetting something?
When you're not here to make me laugh,
even what I'm looking for can't be found.
Snowing, be honest with yourself and smile,
because when two people lay close, time overlaps.
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Don't say goodbye!
Previously on Fairy Tail!
Save my dad!
Give Macao back!
Guess I owe you one.
Natsu, Gray... lend me your power.
I'll tag along, but I have one condition.
When we get back, let's have a match!
I'll take you on.
Why are you doing this?
Eisenwald may have been destroyed, but the root of the problem still remains unresolved.
The number of dark guilds rivals that of the stars themselves.
Then we should come up with a plan to wipe them all out at once.
But, how?
I will not stand for Zeref's magic falling into their hands again!
And how was it that they obtained such magic so easily in the first place?
Blame goes all the way up to the administrative level.
At any rate...
It seems like this time we were saved by that thorn in our sides, Fairy Tail.
They destroyed a whole dark guild with just 4 or 5 people. Impressive.
I know it's not something you want to accept, but that's reality.
We would be in dire straits if the Lullaby had actually killed those guild masters.
It would have cost the heads of many of us standing here.
Fool! You intend to lay blame even on the Council itself?
Enough of this!
Their tendency for wanton destruction gives me headaches! This time too!
Yes... We must repay them for their kindness.
Natsu vs. Erza!
The incident with Eisenwald targeting the guild masters during their regular meeting
became big news immediately and everyone in the country learned of it.
I would have never believed I'd be at the center of such a huge event.
Even so, I'm living my day to day life just like I always do.
Sometimes I think back on what happened and get all excited, though.
I got wind that most of Eisenwald's members were arrested, including that guy named Kage.
Well, I guess that's expected.
The one thing that scares me is they don't seem to have caught Erigor.
What'll I do if he comes to take revenge on Fairy Tail?
But I'll be okay! Natsu, Erza, and Gray are Fairy Tail's strongest team!
Plus: Happy and I are there, too!
This guild's the best, so don't worry, Mom.
I'm doing just fine.
Keep this a secret from Dad,'kay?
Maybe I'll do some shopping today.
Thrilling adventures are great and all, but you can't beat relaxing at home!
Rent for this place is 70,000 jewel? That's really cheap.
You found yourself a nice pad, Lucy!
Trespassing!
And don't strip in other people's homes!
Hold it! It's a misunderstanding!
I was already naked when I arrived.
Leave.
Today's the day, remember?
I figured you'd forget, so I came to get you.
Huh?
Yup, you forgot.
Natsu said so before we left, right?
Get'em!
Fight, Erza!
Natsu!
Natsu and Erza are fighting!
W-Wait, they were serious?
Oh! Hi, Lucy!
Serious as can be! If they didn't take this seriously, they couldn't call themselves men!
Erza's a woman, you know.
More like a female monster.
But if two of the people in the strongest team clash...
Strongest team?
What're you talking about?
You, Natsu, and Erza, duh!
You're the top three in Fairy Tail, right?
Huh? That's just dumb. Who told you that?
Oh, it was Mira-chan...
You made her cry!
I do recognize Natsu's and Gray's manly spirit.
But I wouldn't go calling them the strongest.
There's a ton more strong people in Fairy Tail.
Like me, for example!
Erza is probably the strongest woman, though.
If you're talking about the strongest man, it's probably Mystogan or Laxus.
I just thought that Natsu, Gray, and Erza worked the best together!
Oh? Weren't you saying how you were always worried Gray and Natsu would fight without Erza around?
Regardless, I think this will be an interesting battle.
Really? I expect Erza to win easily.
How many years has it been since we've pitted our magic head to head like this?
I was just a kid then!
Things will be different this time!
Today's the day! I'm going to beat you!
I don't plan on holding back.
It's been a while since I truly tested my own limits!
Flame Empress Armor!
That armor resists fire!
Natsu's flames effectiveness are halved!
Erza, that's going too far!
Yeah, I'll betting on Erza after all. That okay?
What a heartless cat!
I don't like this sort of thing! I don't want either one to lose!
You're unexpectedly innocent, aren't you?
Flame Empress Armor?
In that case, guess I have go full power, no holding back!
Begin!
Wow!
See? I told you it would be a good battle.
What's good about it?
That's enough.
Everyone stay where you are.
I am a messenger from the Council.
The Council?
A messenger?
Why did they send one here?
They're ignoring the scene in front of them, aren't they?
Stemming from the recent Eisenwald incident, we hereby charge you with 11 counts of criminal property damage.
Erza Scarlet, you are under arrest.
Say what?!
And so...
Let me out! Let me out of here!
Natsu, quiet down.
Let me out!!
You'll just go on a rampage if we let you out.
No, I won't! So turn me back!
If I do that, you'll go to rescue her, right?
No, I won't! Who cares about Erza anyway!
It's the Council we're dealing with here. This one's out of our hands.
Let me out! I have something I want to say!
Council or no Council, those guys were the bad ones!
If you're innocent and the Council says you're guilty, then you're guilty.
You seriously think they'd listen to us?
But we've done all that stuff before... Why this time?
Yeah, it's hard to understand.
There's got to be... Got to be something behind it!
This is the Council's Fiore Branch.
This is where judgment will be passed on Erza, but just then...
Siegrain!
Long time no see, Erza.
Don't be so on guard.
This is a thought projection.
My body is now in ERA.
The old men in the next room are also all thought projections.
It's not like they'd actually come all the way here for such a trivial matter.
I see.
This is all your doing, isn't it?
What a pointless farce!
Don't be harsh. After all, I'm on Fairy Tail's side.
The old men were afraid that they would share in the blame,
so they created a plan to push responsibility onto others.
Scapegoating, if you will.
Enough!
As you wish.
I wanted to see you before the trial and warn you.
Say nothing of the past to the old men.
For both our sakes.
I'll be waiting on the other side of the door.
As a member of the Council.
You know some powerful people, don't you?
He's evil.
Don't get in my way, Erza.
Not after I've come this far...
We will now commence this Wizard's Trial.
The accused, Erza Scarlet!
Take the stand.
I can't just stay here! Let's go testify on her behalf!
Lucy...
No, wait!
What are you talking about?
This arrest is an injustice!
Once they decide on a verdict, it'll be too late!
It doesn't matter how fast we go, if we leave now we won't make it in time!
But...
Let me out! I said, let me out!
You sure you want out?
Yes...
What's the matter, Natsu? You suddenly run out of steam?
Macao?!
But, why?
Sorry...
I owed Natsu one.
In order to pose as Natsu, I transformed myself into a gecko.
My dad caught Natsu!
Get to it! I'll pretend to be you!
So then, where's the real Natsu?
He didn't go after Erza, did he?
Yeah, probably.
You've got to be kidding me!
That guy might actually try and punch a council member!
Silence, all of you!
We will wait patiently for the results.
The accused, Erza Scarlet.
In regards to the recent incident involving Eisenwald and the Lullaby.
You will answer to charges concerning the damage to parts of Oshibana Station,
the destruction of the Ryusika Gorge railway,
and the complete collapse of the Clover Meeting Hall.
You are accused of these acts of destruction.
According to witnesses at the scene,
the culprit was an armored female wizard!
What is this?
I am the armored female wizard!
You want to catch me, then just try!
I am Erza!!
If I did somethin' wrong, then spit it out!
And the crime had better be worse than murdering the guild masters!
Take them to the jail.
I apologize for this.
Erza, don't apologize to these guys!
Er, wait... I AM ERZA!!!
I don't even know what to say to you.
This is just a formality!
A formality?
They arrested me just for show.
It's to preserve the order of the magical world.
The council must make a show of enforcing law among wizards.
What? I don't get it at all!
It means that they'll find me guilty, but there won't be any real punishment!
I'd probably have been back today.
If you hadn't gone nuts, that is!
I can't believe you...
Sorry...
But... I'm glad you came.
Ow!
I see... So he was in Fairy Tail?
Natsu Dragneel...
Ah, the sweet smell of freedom!
Just smell it, yes!
Who knew freedom was so great?
Shut it, would you?
Freedom!
Pipe down!
This is what makes him so lovable.
So it was all an arrest for show...
And I was so worried...
I see! She's a scapegoat but not a sacrificial lamb!
You're an ice wizard, all right...
That joke gave me the chills...
So, what about your man-to-man battle with Erza, Natsu?
Man?
Oh yeah, I forgot!
Erza, let's continue where we left off!
No. I'm tired.
Here I come!
What am I to do with you?
Ah, well.
Shall we begin?
It's over!
Lame, Natsu!
Erza's strong, that's for sure!
What's the matter, Master?
This is...
Sleepy...
Mystogan...
I'm off.
Hey!
Aren't you going to undo the sleeping magic?
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
This feels like... Was Mystogan here?
That bastard!
He always uses such super powerful magic.
Mystogan.
One of the strongest men in Fairy Tail.
He does this because he doesn't like other people to see his face.
When he comes to take a job, he always puts everyone to sleep like this.
What's with that? That's way too suspicious.
So no one other than the master knows what he looks like.
No. I know what he looks like.
Laxus!
You were here?
That's rare.
Another one of the strongest.
Mystogan's shy. Keep your noses outta it!
Laxus! Fight me!
You were just beat by Erza a second ago!
That's right! If you can't even beat Erza, there's no way you could beat me.
What are you implying!
Whoa, calm down there, Erza.
That I am the strongest.
Then get down here and prove it, jerk!
How about you come up here?
Fine by me!
You cannot go upstairs!
Not yet.
Seems you've made him angry.
Laxus, enough!
I'm not giving up my seat as the strongest in Fairy Tail for anyone!
Not to Erza or Mystogan, either.
I am the strongest!
About what Master said before...
How he can't go up to the second floor. Why is that?
It's a bit early to talk to you about it, Lucy.
But the second-floor request board has jobs posted to it so difficult they don't even compare to the ones on the first.
S class quests.
S class?
These are jobs where the slightest mistake would mean death.
Of course, the rewards are correspondingly high.
Only wizards who the master approves can take on S class quests.
If you include Erza, Laxus, and Mystogan, then there are only 5 people who can do them.
S class is not really something you should seek out.
They're all jobs where you'd need a great number of lives!
Seems like it...
Watch your step, missy!
I've heard of both Mystosan and Laxus before.
Fairy Tail really is an amazing guild.
And I think I know how everyone ranks in power about now.
I'm gonna work hard starting tomorrow!
You smell like a gym!
If you're gonna weight lift, do it in your own house!
What are you saying? We're a team, right?
Here, you try!
You like pink, right?
Sure, but I don't care about barbells!
We've got to get more powerful if we're gonna beat Erza and Laxus.
Aye, sir!
It doesn't matter to me, now leave!
We're gonna train all night!
Somebody save me!
I decided.
Let's do an S class quest, Lucy!
S class!
How'd you get that?
I thought you couldn't go up to the second floor?
We went up and took one.
Cat burglar!
Well, it's our first time, so we picked the cheapest one.
Even so, it's still 7 million jewel!
No way! We don't have permission to do an S class.
If we do this right, then gramps'll have to recognize us.
Really, you're always doing crazy things like this.
At least follow the rules of your own guild.
If I do that, I'll never get to go up to the second floor!
Anyway, I can't go. You two enjoy yourselves.
It's a job where we're supposed to rescue an island.
An island?
Galuna, the cursed island!
Now I'm definitely not going!
Even if I offer to give you half the fish?
That's not an incentive!
Tch. We're leaving.
Aye.
Go cool your heads a little, sheesh.
Hey! Leave using the door!
They left the poster!
Wait, now it looks like I stole it!
What am I going to do?
No, way! You also get one of the 12 Gold Gate keys?
Natsu, Happy, wait!
Oh, no!
One of the requests on the second floor disappeared!
Take me away to someplace!
Let's ride on a tin horse, just the two of us.
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
It's sad that my beloved doll can't talk to me...
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
Every time I think of you tears start to flow...
I'm a crybaby, aren't I?
In the moon (the moon) at night (at night)
I'm always (I'm always)
searching for the rabbit!
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
so much it's like I'm under a spell.
This love is a monologue
from which I'll never awaken.
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
since I've completely fallen in love.
I wonder what spell I could chant,
to get through to you?
The perfect thing to say.
Spouting this and that,
I just love you like crazy!
One day I want to be able to tell you
You got me.
My words of thanks.
There's nothing more to say!
Natsu, which should we do?
Good question.
It's our first time, so let's do the simplest one.
Aye.
Then how about this Galuna Island one?
I bet that Lucy would want this extra reward.
Yeah, this is good!
Let's decide on this one.
Aye!
Next time: The Cursed Island!
Okay! Let's go lift weights at Lucy's house until we go on the job!
Nothing like a work out to get you invigorated!
