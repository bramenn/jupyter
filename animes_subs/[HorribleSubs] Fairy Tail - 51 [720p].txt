So, Lucy... You're actually a daughter of a really rich family.
And you ran away from home, right?
What's with you all of a sudden?
I bet you ate some super fancy food, didn't you?
Man, you're makin' me hungry!
Like fish from around the world!
I knew that's where you were going.
If it's love and dreams and you it'll become magical.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
I kind of admired this powerful world,
chock-full of problems.
Frozen time has started to move again
ever since I met you.
Why were we born? Why do we live?
I don't need any complicated answers.
Laugh! Cry! Be honest with yourself.
Simple feelings are the most important.
You can change those tears shed on sad nights into strength.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
Magnolia in twilight...
It is then that a single man arrives.
Things are oddly quiet today.
It's nice to have days like this once in a while.
It's kind of lonely, though.
Damn it... If only I had Virgo...
I'd have been able to dig it up...
You're still talking about that?
I could so care less about that already! Let's go on a job!
But I totally care.
What'll I do about this month's rent?
Let's go on a job.
That's a quick about-face, Natsu.
You're finally in the mood to work again!
Thank you!
Well, I've always been working... Just here and there... Right, Happy?
Aye!
What's wrong, Lucy?
Love Lucky!
Maybe it was my imagination.
But lately I've been getting a feeling like I'm being watched.
There it is!
What do they call that again?
It's called being overly self-conscious!
Not that, sheesh!
I hope it's just my imagination!
Those two really do get along.
Yeah...
Whatever.
We'll meet up at noon tomorrow,'kay?
'Kay?
Okay!
Tomorrow's... gonna be a fun... day of work!
Lucy-chan, be careful!
I'm fine, just fine!
I wonder what I should wear?
Be careful on your way home!
Thanks!
I knew it! Someone is watching me!
He's following me!
Lucy!
Stop it!
It's me.
Your dad...
No way...
Father?
Why are you here?
And... what's with those clothes?
Heartfilia Railways was confiscated.
I lost everything... My company, my house, my money...
But that's...
All the private property was used as collateral, see...
Is this my reward for being a serious businessman all these years?!
W-Wait, the house?
That's where mom's grave is!
I transferred it here.
It's not so much sad, as it is laughable.
That much wealth, gone in an instant.
All my long years of achievement, to naught in a single night...
The money I worked so hard for I even sacrificed my family!
It's laughable! What a farce!
Why have you come here?
To see my daughter's face, Lucy.
Why now?
And I told you not to lay a hand on Fairy Tail!
I don't have that kind of power now.
I only came to see how my daughter was doing.
Please, don't give me that kind of look.
I'm sorry about everything that happened.
I don't plan to remain here long.
I'm going to go work at a trade guild in Acalypha.
I'm going to start all over again.
Acalypha?
You'll see it soon if you travel to the west from here.
I see...
So, about that, Lucy...
I'm going to need some money.
100,000 jewel would be enough. Would you lend it to me?
T-That much money? There's no way I have that!
That much?
It's just 100,000!
You're my daughter... I'm sure you have that much on hand.
What the hell are you spouting?
Money! And I'm putting my pride aside to beg you for it!
Yes, even I!
Enough! Now, give me money!
I don't know what you're saying...
Is this how you treat your father?
I told you back then, remember?
What I want isn't money, or pretty dresses, or fortune forced upon me...
And the same goes for you, Father.
You don't have any fortunes waiting for you!
Lucy!
Leave!
I can't believe him... How could he stoop so low?
Sergeant Happy, is everything normal?
Aye, sir! Captain!
Lucy, there's no one suspicious around here.
Thanks...
Captain!
This private here lacks enthusiasm, sir!
Why am I a private?
Yup, seems like it.
Everything okay, Lucy?
Don't tell me he's...
Captain! I've spotted a questionable subject!
There you are!
That hurt, you jerk!
What are you doing, you jerk?
Gray!
So it was Gray that was following Lucy!
N-No, it's not...
No!
I heard that Lucy was being followed by someone suspicious,
so I couldn't just leave her alone!
I came to see how she was doing.
He lllikes her!
What kind of running gag is that?!
I never really liked you,
but you just dropped even worse in my book, Gray!
Oh, yeah?!
Going around topless is one thing, but stalking girls?
Any way you look at it, you're a giant per...
Oh, I ain't gonna let you say it. No way.
I ain't said anything.
Shut up, you crazy flame spewer!
Bring it on, icy minty fresh!
Please don't fight in front of people's houses!
Lucy, let's go on a job!
Let's go!
Sure!
So, what kind of job are we going on?
Ain't decided yet.
This.
Capture the escaped convict Velveno.
Velveno? You mean Velveno, the Guild Hunter?
So they found out where he is?
This guy uses some awesome magic!
I'm fired up!
The reward is 400,000 a person.
You can pay your rent with that, Lucy.
Yeah! That's about 6 months' worth. I'll do it!
Hey, did you hear about what's going on in Acalypha?
Some trade guild is being held up by a group of armed robbers.
Damn...
Acalypha?
And that armed group is actually the Dark Guild, Naked Mummy.
Seriously? Then the army ain't gonna be able to handle them...
Lately, the number of Dark Guild incidents has increased a lot.
Dangerous...
I'm going to go work at a trade guild in Acalypha.
Father...
It doesn't matter what happens to him... It's not my...
Where's Acalypha?
Hey, Lucy!
She's not here. I wonder where she went?
Lucy?
Even if he is that man... I have to save him!
The trade guild Love Lucky in the town of Acalypha.
What's happened to the hostages?
Please save them! My husband is in there!
Everyone, stay calm!
We've put up requests for assistance at nearby wizard guilds.
It's dangerous, so stay back!
Father...
Hurry and do something!
Hey, now... Civilians can't go inside!
I might have family in there!
I said no!
Hey! No means no!
I've got to do something... Something...
That's it!
Gate of the Maiden, I open thee!
Virgo!
Princess, is it time for punishment?
Uh, no!
I've got a favor to ask...
Princess.
It seems I am able to enter into the building.
Thank you, Virgo.
You wish to punish me?
I'm thanking you!
But there are a number of wizards inside.
Will we be okay with just ourselves?
I don't have a choice.
Let's go.
What? I thought a trade guild would have a ton of cash, but this is it?
We should have just gone for a bank instead.
Shut up!
We ain't got no time! Hurry and put the money in the sacks!
Shuddap, you!
Huh? Mmph, mmph, mmph?
Your butt itches or somethin'?
If we don't get this money, we're in big trouble!
Enough, man!
We don't got no time!
Taurus!
I won't allow you to lay hands on a lady!
What's this?
A cow?
No, it's a Spirit!
Why is a Spirit here?
Where'd it come from?
That's far enough!
What?
A woman?
She's a wizard from an official guild! Damn it!
Be good, or you're gonna get hurt!
Cancer!
Today's scissors are sharper than ever-ebi.
Sagittarius!
I will bring them all down, as it were. Moshimoshi.
The final blow!
I wonder what magic she'll use next?
Lucy...
Disappointing-ebi.
Break in!
Father?
Thanks, Miss!
You saved us!
Well...
Your magic's awesome!
We also wish to give you our thanks.
Father...
Where?
You're a wizard from Fairy Tail?
Yeah, well...
I'm so shocked such an incredible person came to save us!
Why isn't he here?
So... Is he safe?
Father!
Lucy?
Don't tell me...you just came to town?
I don't have any money, so I walked all the way here.
So all that was for nothing?
And wait... You wanted to borrow 100,000 for traveling money?
What kind of warped sense of prices do you have?
Why are you here?
Why? Because I heard that the guild you were headed to was attacked!
Everything is fine now.
Please take it easy!
Captain, a number have escaped!
You came here worried for your dad?
As if! I'm outta here!
I see...
Thank you...
Don't get any strange ideas.
It's not like I've forgiven you.
Yes, that's fine.
It's only natural.
You have traveled quite a long way, indeed.
I've also had a lot of time to think.
I apologize about yesterday.
I wasn't thinking straight.
I regret what I did. It's shameful.
I'm going to change who I am.
Even without money, I made it here.
I'm sure I can do anything.
This guild is the place I met Layla... I mean, your mother.
When I was thinking about going independent,
that was right when you were in your mother's stomach.
The two of us quit the guild.
But right then, the guild's signboard broke.
Lucky turned into Lucy.
That was quite a strange thing.
The two of us decided that if we had a daughter to name her Lucy.
What?
Don't decide your daughter's name on a whim like that.
You're right.
Sorry about that.
But I'm glad I got to see you.
Not as Lucky Lucy of the Heartfilias...
I was able to see you as Just Lucy, like you wanted to become.
Lucy, you safe?
What happened?
Lucy!
Could it be you handled everything here yourself?
Not bad.
Yeah, well...
Stay well, Father.
What was with you all of a sudden?
It was nothing!
Nothing my butt!
We canceled the job!
Sorry about that.
Layla...
I was really such a fool...
The main headquarters of the Dark Guild Naked Mummy.
What about the money?
I'm sworry!
An official guild got in our way!
We couldn't get our hands on anything!
Please, save me!
What about the money?
You said the same line twice!
If they ain't got it, they ain't got it, Gato-niisan.
-niisan is an honorific for one's older brother.
This isn't a time to be laughing, Zato-niisan.
We're coming close to the deadline for paying our dues to Oracion Seis.
This isn't a time to be laughing, Zato-niisan.
You repeated yourself again, Gato-niisan.
I've always wondered, but how can they both be the older brother?
There ain't any Dark Guilds that disobeys Oracion Seis.
There ain't any Dark...
I heard you the first time!
Those bastards suddenly upped the money payments they demand.
What in the world are they plannin'?
I can hear it...
The sound of the changing of an era... The sound of eyes opening...
The sound of something beginning...
The breaking of the light!
Natsu, the master was calling for you.
He said he wanted to talk about some important job.
I wonder if there was some big crisis...
It sounds like we're going to team up with some other guilds to go defeat a Dark Guild!
This doesn't sound like your everyday gig!
I'm gettin' fired up!
Next time: Allied Forces, Gather Up!
I wonder what kind of people will gather up?
Fateful encounter! That's romance! That's suspense!
What are you talking about, Happy?
