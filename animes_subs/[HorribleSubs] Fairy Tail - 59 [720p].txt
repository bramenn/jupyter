The 88 Stars of the Heavens.
Shine!
Urano Meteoria!
If it's love and dreams and you it'll become magical.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
I kind of admired this powerful world,
chock-full of problems.
Frozen time has started to move again
ever since I met you.
Why were we born? Why do we live?
I don't need any complicated answers.
Laugh! Cry! Be honest with yourself.
Simple feelings are the most important.
You can change those tears shed on sad nights into strength.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
Huh? What was I...
What happened?
Hibiki! Happy!
Oh right, Natsu!
Oracion Seis... doesn't lose...
Recollections of Jellal.
What is this...
It's like I have no power at all...
And hey... Why is she so beat up?
One woman, one kill!
Blast away to oblivion!
It missed?
You too?!
Natsu!
My prayer...
My prayer...
To disappear into the sky...
I said sky, not water!
Natsu!
Get it together!
Hold out your hand, Natsu!
What the... Rapids?
Hold it a sec... You've got to be kidding me!
Natsu!
I-Impossible...
Even Angel has fallen?
Your death will not be in vain!
The extinction of the light will begin soon!
I'm not dead, buddy.
Jellal is alive?
But how?
And wait... Why is he here?
Erza...
Erza, there is no such thing as freedom in this world.
Let Erza go!
I don't know... I don't know how I should face him...
My heavens...
You say that Nirvana is a magic that can change people's personality?
Exactly! Yes...
The first stage is that black light,
which forcibly changes anyone trapped in the boundary between good and evil.
Yes...
Which means that you were in the gap between good and evil?
I felt like I was doing something a bit wrong in the name of earning money.
Yes...
You seemed pretty happy about it to me.
It was all for my long-lost brother...
All to search for my brother!
It was for that I wanted money!
Yes...
When I look at you, I remember the past...
Could it be... Are you saying I resemble your brother, perhaps?
You are the spitting image of the potatoes my brother used to eat!
Potato head?!
Now, let's stop Brain and the others for the sake of love! Yes...
R-Right...
What's wrong?
What the heck has been going on?
None of my magic has...
Damn it!
Air Magic, Aerial Shot!
I missed again?
Goddamn it!
But... why?
That makes two.
How boring. Isn't there anyone stronger?
I wonder if I shouldn't have come?
Are you still saying that, Wendy?
Well...
Those negative feelings will get your heart stolen by the darkness.
But I ran away leaving Lucy-san and the others, right?
That's because you wouldn't have been any help regardless.
I knew it, I'm just...
But without you here, Erza would be dead now.
Yeah...
But we weren't able to find Nirvana either.
I wonder...
You were happy to be able to meet that Jellal person, right?
But that's...
So what is with Jellal?
You said he saved your life,
but I've never heard anything about that.
Oh, yeah... I never told you, did I?
It was seven years ago...
The Sky Dragon, Grandine, vanished.
And I was wandering along the road...
Grandine... Where are you, Grandine?
What's the matter?
She's gone...
What?
She disappeared!
That was how we met.
He was in the middle of traveling, and told me that he was lost as well.
So for the next month, we continued traveling together with no destination in mind...
Jellal!
Even on a nasty day like this, some good can come.
See?
Where did you pick them?
Don't ask...
Now, let's eat.
Yeah!
Wait here a second.
Thank you...
Where are we going now?
I don't know... Where would be nice?
Can I tag along with you forever?
Of course.
But one day, he said something weird all of a sudden...
Anima!
Huh? What's the matter?
No! I wanna come with you!
You can't. It'll be dangerous if you come.
But why? I don't want to leave you, Jellal!
If you head past this forest, there's a guild.
They'll take care of you there.
No!
Wendy...
No!
But in the end, I was taken in by the guild,
and that was Caitshelter...
Then, what happened to Jellal?
I never met him afterwards.
But I heard rumors later...
About how a council member that looked just like Jellal
had done a bunch of really bad things recently.
But he was really nice back then!
I wonder if Jellal remembers me?
Erza? She was revived?
Damn it!
How is it that I didn't notice she was so close?!
I won't let you interfere until the main body of Nirvana starts up!
Jellal...
Erza...
Why are you here?
I don't know.
Erza...
Er...za...
I don't remember anything except that word...
Will you tell me? Who am I?
Do you know?
Who is Erza?
I can't remember anything!
He's lost all his memories?
Jellal...
What was that for, Gray?!
Carla, stand back!
Leave everything to me! I'll save Natsu!
Wait, no one's here...
What happened?
I can't remember anything!
He's lost all his memories?
Jellal...
Stay back!
Stay back...
Then you come to me!
For I am Erza!
Come here.
Your name is Jellal.
You were once my friend.
Friend?
But you went mad, desecrated the dead, hurt your friends,
and even destroyed the Magic Council.
You killed Simon.
If you...
If you are trying to say you forgot that,
then I will thrust a blade into your chest and engrave it into your heart!
Come here!
Come before me!
To my friends...
No...
What have I done?
What... What should I...
Is this really that Jellal?
Ouch...
Huh? A bandage?
And wait, what's with these clothes?
They are items from the Spirit World.
As yours were quite in tatters...
Virgo!
Where are we?
I gave Natsu-sama a matching outfit.
That really isn't necessary!
Jellal! Where's that light?
It's close. And wait, hasn't the color changed?
Yes. While you two were unconscious, it changed from black to white.
That was a close call. Thanks.
What's with you all of a sudden...
He lllikes you!
Would you quit it with that?!
Oh yeah, where's Happy?
I have not seen him.
Lucy, weren't you with Erza?
We all got separated.
Oh, well... I guess the two of us should head to that light ourselves.
Princess, I will now take my leave.
Virgo!
Virgo just passed through the gate using her own magic...
Wait, do I have zero magic power left?
Sherry!
Thank goodness you're safe!
It's you! Weren't you on Galuna Island...
Oh yeah, where's doggy and'brows?
Do you know how many episodes back that was?!
I found you, Fairy Tail wizards...
What?
You idiot!
Gray!
You guys safe?
Let me go! Damn you! You're still alive?
I'm getting revenge for Lyon-sama!
She's been acting all weird after that light appeared.
You were acting pretty weird before too!
Huh?
Natsu, that was a fake...
I won't forgive you! Revenge for Lyon-sama!
Revenge for who exactly?
Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.
Lyon-sama?
He's a stubborn one.
Well, it was pretty close...
That guy's bomb lacrima was more powerful than I thought.
It took a long time before I was able to move again.
Yup, he's stubborn all right.
Well, I'm not as stubborn as this guy.
Say what?!
You jump down his throat for that?
Thank... goodness...
What's this?
As I thought, she was taken over by something...
That's Nirvana...
The black pillar has turned white!
I wonder what's happening?
Hibiki, wake up already!
I hope everyone is okay...
Natsu... Erza...
Okay, I get that you don't remember anything.
No wonder I wasn't able to hear your thoughts at all...
Oracion Seis!
How'd you manage to get here?
And why did you unlock Nirvana's seal?
I heard someone's voice while I was asleep.
It said, We are going to obtain Nirvana.
I dimly remembered the place where that magic was hidden.
This is a dangerous magic. It can't fall into anyone's hands.
And that's why I released the seal... To destroy it completely.
To destroy Nirvana?
I've already set up the magic circle of self-destruction.
Nirvana will shortly destroy itself.
What the heck is this high-level magic circle?
At this rate, Nirvana will be destroyed!
Jellal! Spit out the cancellation code!
Erza...
I can feel the kindness from that name...
I can feel kindness, cheerfulness, and warmth...
I'm sure you'll continue to hate me...
But I can't help that... It's only natural.
But hatred will steal the freedom from your heart.
It will eat away at you from within...
You...
I can't go that far...
I can't go before you!
He's...
You will be free from Jellal...
I will take your hatred and sadness... with me...
He's attached a magic circle of self-destruction to his own body?!
You are... free!
Jellal!
What'll we do? Nirvana has been resurrected!
And it's got legs!
So Nirvana was actually an octopus?
It's not an octopus, duh!
Then, a squid?
Fine, squid, whatever.
Can we stop squidding around and go already?
Happy...
I think you got the wrong show!
Huh?
Next time: March of Destruction!
That's not what I was trying to...
Don't deny it!
I thought it was awesome!
I think I'll leave him here and go by myself.
