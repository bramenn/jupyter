Dragon Slayer's Secret Art!
Has she already mastered them both?!
There it is!
Go!
Wendy knows the Secret Art?!
Incredible!
She's as good as won.
What is this?
A magic wind barrier?
You've sealed us inside!
Light Burst: Sky Drill!
Cheria!
Yeah!
She did it!
I haven't mastered Milky Way yet...
I used all my magic...
W-Well, well...
You were wonderful, Wendy.
Maybe I went overboard...
But this way...
Cheria's down!
The winner, from Fairy Tail A...
Sorry! Wait a second!
I'm just getting started!
You're impressive, Wendy.
Are you okay? Want to give up?
Aye, sir! The Grand Magic Games are really picking up steam!
Natsu's Fairy Tail Team A
was in eighth place for the qualifier, barely making it to the real games,
and then they got creamed the first day.
But even so, through Natsu's good showing,
their points rose little by little!
But with Raven Tail's pesky obstructions...
And we can't forget Sabertooth.
Currently, they're known as the strongest guild in Fiore.
They've got two Dragon Slayers in their ranks, Sting and Rogue.
Their abilities are top-notch.
A lot happened with Yukino, a Celestial Spirit Wizard,
but they're formidable enemies.
Speaking of a lot happened, Raven Tail's Alexei
was revealed to be guild master Ivan!
Ivan is our master Makarov's son.
In other words, he's Laxus's son.
And Gajeel had been working as a double agent in order to investigate Raven Tail.
At last, the showdown between father and son guilds was over.
Continuing with the battle part, Wendy was up next
against Cheria from Lamia Scale!
She's Sherry's cousin!
I hear Lamia Scale and Blue Pegasus once allied with Fairy Tail to battle Oracion Seis?
That's right!
A magical celebration with a mix of old faces and new guilds,
that's the Grand Magic Games!
Alright, everyone! Thank you for your patience!
Let's continue with the Wendy vs. Cheria battle!
Hooray! Hooray! Fairy Tail!
I guess you're not going to give up?
Wendy!
She can barely stand!
Wendy...
This is an incredible fight...
Small Fist!
If that Cheria girl
has some connection to Zeref...
Hey, you!
Huh? This guy...
From Fairy Tail...?
Should I stop this? Or wait and see?
Wendy...
But right now...
Seven years ago, I infiltrated Fairy Tail.
To some extent, I'm acquainted with inside information on Fairy Tail.
Mystogan...
You're not supposed to exist in this world.
I don't mind fighting,
but I've got no love for one-sided violence where the outcome is clear.
The Council... At a time like this...
You know, you can always surrender.
I can't!
The fact that I'm standing here
means that I'm prepared to fight for my guild!
I don't need your pity.
Until I fall and can't move anymore,
come at me with everything you've got!
Please!
Wendy...
Sure.
That's only common courtesy.
Right!
Well, now it's my turn to break out a big move!
I'll make it easy on you and end this with one strike.
God Slayer's Secret Art!
Cheria, no!
Not that!
Fool! Do you mean to kill your opponent?!
I'm answering the full strength of your feelings with my full strength!
That's what love is!
W-What is that magic?!
That's...
Heaven's Gathering Clouds!
She dodged it!
No... It missed her!
It seems Cheria can heal herself with her magic,
but it only works on wounds.
It looks like she can't recharge herself with energy.
Right.
Wendy's the opposite. She can't heal herself with her magic,
but she can restore another person's strength.
I see...
Then...
And because of that, Cheria's magic gained too much force...
Wendy made her miss...
What strategy!
Amazing!
Crushing Fang...
That's great, Wendy!
This is an incredible turn of events!
Neither side is giving any ground!
It's a clash of little fists! Is this tenacity for the sake of their guilds?!
I can't stop this...
Though their fists are small,
their passion is vast...
Go! Neither of you lose!
Wendy...
And so...
The match is over and it's a draw!
Both teams receive five points!
Awesome!
You did great, Wendy!
Both of them were magnificent.
Yep.
Cheria and Wendy both did very well.
We were lucky to get to see that.
This is the best match I've seen yet!
Even though judging them on magic alone, Cheria's level is far higher...
U-Um...
I'm no good when it comes to battle,
but I can use a lot of support magic that'll be useful to everyone.
So... So please don't leave me out!
The girl from back then...
Wendy...
W-What are you crying for?
Did it hurt? I'm sorry.
I'm fine. That's all I hear from you.
That was fun, Wendy.
My wounds...
I enjoyed it too, a little.
Hey, let's be friends, okay?
Sure.
I mean, if you want me as a friend...
No, no, no!
Answer like friends are supposed to.
Let's be friends, Wendy!
Sure, Cheria!
What a moving ending!
For this old man, the tournament is over!
Hold on there. Just the third day is over.
Thank you, everyone!
What's this?!
Even though the fight's over, that sinister magic is still around?!
Then Cheria isn't the source of that magic?!
It's from over there!
Heading towards the exit!
Did he notice me?
But...
And so, the third day ended.
At this point, Sabertooth is the top team with 34 points.
Mermaid Heel is in second place.
Lamia Scale is in third,
making those the best three.
Below them, the order goes Fairy Tail B, A,
and then Blue Pegasus.
Fairy Tail's showing is unexpected.
Perhaps I need to think a bit-k-kabo...
The source of that mysterious magic...
It's him!
I found him!
He came out of nowhere!
You're not going anywhere.
Even though the person who possesses that mysterious magic is right over there...
Who are you?!
I'll put him to sleep.
No...
Right now, I'm supposed to be a Fairy Tail wizard.
I can't lay a hand on a member of the Council.
Doranbolt, what's all the commotion about?
Dammit!
I know you're not Mystogan.
So who are you?
I'll ask once more.
Who are you?!
Sorry. I'm in a hurry.
Oh, no, you don't!
Mystogan isn't in Earthland.
I'm Mystogan.
What are you...?!
Who are you?!
I'm starvin'!
Come on, Natsu!
I'm trying to bask in the afterglow of that touching ending!
I can't help bein' hungry!
Alright, let's get somethin' to eat, Happy!
He's incorrigible...
M-Me too...
Aye, sir!
Yeesh...
Ah, well...
We got to see a good match today.
I'm sure dinner will be really good tonight.
Crap...
Jellal?!
Oh, so there you are, Mystogan-kun!
Yajima-san!
Lahar-kun...
You can understand why Mystogan-kun hides his face, can't you?
He was unlucky enough to be born with the same face as Jellal.
I hope you understand.
You're saying... He's another person?!
Perhaps you know of the world called Edolas?
Yes. I heard about it from one of my subordinates.
That world and this one are connected.
There are people who have the same faces.
Then you're from Edolas?
Yeah.
That was a great match, wasn't it?!
Yep!
Jellal!
Kagura!
Hey, what's wrong?!
Kagura-san!
Kagura-chan!
Kagura! Get a hold of yourself!
Somebody call for a medic!
Kagura-chan is...
What's wrong?!
Is she okay?
Jell...
I'm all right now. I've calmed down.
But he's over there...
I know.
I'm okay now.
I'm sorry.
So they've been hiding him...
Jellal in Fairy Tail...?
Why, Er-chan?!
I appreciate your understanding.
Oh, no.
I apologize for not knowing the circumstances.
To me, Jellal is an evil being.
If I run into him, you can bet I'll report him.
Good.
Well then...
I owe you, Yajima-san.
Just this once.
Get out of here before you cause Makarov any trouble.
Yes.
I swear I'll be gone by the time the tournament is over.
That was the real thing.
I don't want Yajima-san to lose face here,
but we won't let him get away!
Did I lose him?
That magic was like Zeref's and yet it wasn't his.
Who are you?!
Maybe...
Because you're father and son...
Silence!
I've been waiting all this time for this day!
It was all to get Lumen Histoire!
Where is Lumen Histoire?! Where is it?!
Tell me, Laxus! You're my son, aren't you?!
Gramps...
What's Lumen Histoire?
You heard this from Ivan?
Heard about it? All I know is he wanted it badly.
That brat will be the end of me...
He called it Fairy Tail's darkness.
It's not darkness.
First Master!
Lumen Histoire...
That's our guild's light.
First Master, you mustn't!
I know.
Only the master of this guild has the right to know about it.
Laxus, do you understand?
If it ain't anything weird, then I won't bother looking into it.
Thank you!
But where did Ivan get ahold of that information?
The second master...
It was likely Purehito.
It's possible...
I never imagined that Purehito would fall to the dark side.
And now, as a result of my shallow-brained selection...
No.
It's not your fault, First Master.
It is my fault!
First Master!
G-Gramps! What do we do?!
I'm not crying! Not at all!
I'm not... crying...
Laxus!
Go on, hold her!
That hurdle's too high!
Hey, hey, another battle in bathing suits!
Say, Natsu!
Just before, I saw a swimsuit that was laid out in the dressing room of another guild.
Yeah, so?
It was just the bottoms!
Meaning a contestant went out there topless!
Huh! That's wild!
That's not really the reaction I was looking for...
Next time: Naval Battle!
What kind of reaction did you expect?
Wowie! Are you serious?! Like that...
Or I'm goin' to the front line!
What the hell is that?
