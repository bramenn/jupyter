Correction and Declaration
An anime...
An anime!
I'm so glad! I'm so glad!
Saikou?
So a person can actually be this happy...
I'm so happy, it feels like my heart will stop.
What are you saying? You can't marry Miho if you're dead.
Yeah.
It starts now. Right from here.
This really was your dream.
There isn't an author out there who wouldn't be happy about getting an anime,
but you don't see many as happy as you.
Sorry, we got carried away.
Just celebrate today.
But...
Think carefully about the reason Reversi got an anime and Zombie Gun didn't.
The reason?
The Chief Editor chose Reversi for the future of Jack.
That's what I think.
You understand what that means, right?
He entrusted us...
with Jack's future?
Yes.
Become the true flagship!
Yes!
Eiji Ltd
Hello?
It's Heishi. Thanks for your work, as always.
Thank you as well, Chief Editor.
I think you've heard about it from Yuujirou.
Yes.
The anime that starts after CROW ends will be Reversi.
To tell the truth, Ashirogi isn't up to your level yet, Niizuma.
However, I want them to one day become an author that can stand shoulder to shoulder with you.
That is why I turned around and chose Reversi to become an anime.
So that both of you can continue to compete with each other and grow.
That is the future of Shounen Jack as I envision it.
I am sorry to have gotten your hopes up regarding this.
What are you talking about, Chief Editor?
This is the best!
I'm way more hyped up this way!
I'll draw like I've never drawn before!
We did it.
I still feel like I'm dreaming.
You have to tell Azuki that we got an anime.
Yeah.
As well as the fact that the heroine's role will be decided through an audition.
Of course, as the author, they will listen to your opinion,
and if you insist, they will give it due consideration.
However, the final decision will come from the director and the production company.
Azuki will be fine. She's got the popularity and the skills.
We've gotten this far already. We have to fulfill the rest of your and Azuki's dream.
Yeah.
We'll definitely fulfill it!
New mail
We did it!
An anime adaptation
of REVERSI has been
approved to start airing in
October. Voice actors will
be decided through auditions.

Incoming call
She's calling instead of texting me?!
H-Hello?
Congratulations!
Thanks.
Just congratulations, though?
Satoru, you've changed.
You used to be more kind.
Those are Naho's lines from Reversi!
You just went along with it? What do you mean?
You just went along with it?
What do you mean?
You too... Naho...
You too... Naho...
If everyone thought and acted the same as I... as Satoru does,
the world would be a much better place.
It's not too late. We can still remake it.
Normalcy and common sense
are just shackles imposed by the people who run the world.
Wow. That really is my ideal voice for Naho.
It's perfect.
I have no other opinions or advice to give to you.
I didn't perform that to get your advice.
I just wanted to let you know that I'm also working towards our dream.
I can see that now.
I've also memorized most of her lines from Volume 2.
Great!
Want to hear them?
Sure.
Oh, you're here.
Good morning.
You, too.
There are two new offers for you that came in.
The role of Shouko in Diploma Girl Shouko
and the role of Kamasu in A Child Star's Coming of Age.
Oh, that last one's a male character, though.
I won't do either.
Oh, okay. Either is fine
What?!
Well, I guess becoming too well-known can be a bad thing.
If possible, I'd like to hold off from any new work until summer.
I don't get her. I don't get this girl.
But she's succeeding as a voice actress, despite her headstrong personality.
All right. I won't put you in for any new work until summer.
Thank you.
Oh, and boss...
Thank you for everything, as always.
I'm really thankful.
What? The role of Naho will be auditioned?
Yeah.
I know Miho will definitely pass, but...
Of course she will.
Azuki can get the role with just her skill alone.
I'll say.
Sokkai High School Female Student
Kitami Ririka
Oh. Kitami Ririka is in Impromptu 12 , too.
She's Katou's friend, right?
Do you think she knows Miho, too?
She's a fledgling voice actress, after all.
Oh, here it is.
Kitami Ririka's blog.
Why are you looking her up?
I'm just curious.
She was cute.
It was because one of my friends is an assistant to Ashirogi Mutou, who are serializing Reversi and I made her ask them if I could come _; It turns out that Ashirogi are a duo I wonder if it's okay for me to say this?)
She wrote a post about the party the other day.
They're both really hot, kyaa!
Unfortunately, one of them is married.
She's talking about you, isn't she?
Yeah.
The other one happens to be dating a voice actress whom I admire.
But I won't tell you who!
She didn't mention names, but this isn't good, right?
Y-Yeah.
I'll call Katou and have her tell her friend to delete this post!
I'm very sorry!
Well, she did delete it right away.
I told her never to let this happen again.
Well, the fact that Ashirogi is a two-man team,
and that one of us is married while the other is dating someone
isn't really of interest to most people.
But it'd be bad if it got out that the girl you're dating is the voice actress, Azuki Miho.
Her fans may get a nasty shock,
and when it gets out that we want her to play the role of the heroine in Reversi,
a work which was co-created by her boyfriend,
they might accuse us of favoritism.
R-Really?
There are some wild rumors on the'net. You guys okay?
Huh? Rumors?
That you and Azuki Miho are an item.
Looks like there's someone who read Kitami Ririka's blog
and posted about it on the internet.
Sounds like some classmate you had in middle school.
Uh, but...
I thought we were fine because we had her delete that entry two days ago!
Ririka said in an interview that Azuki is a voice actress that she respects.

Well, there we go!
I'm sure you know this already, but you shouldn't pay them any attention.
Yes, I know.
And also, we didn't do anything wrong.

We're fine, but what about Azuki?
I'll be leaving, then.
You have one more recording session today.
Okay.
I'm from Touzai Sports!
Is the A in Azuki the A in Ashirogi?
If you're from the press, then please let us through first!
Do you really have a boyfriend?
It's not true, right?

What's this?
Hello, this is Weekly Shounen Jack.
Ashirogi did what? I have no knowledge of that.
I cannot comment on that.
Sorry.
Don't sweat it.
It's been so noisy in here ever since that news article came out.
Is Ashirogi okay?

Now that I think about it, all heroines in Ashirogi's manga resemble Azuki Miho.
Is that why Azukyun is the heroine in PCP's drama CD?
They resemble her because she's his girlfriend, duh.

He got her to act in the drama CD, basically favoritism.
They're just going to town on us.
Anonymous
Favoritism ain't good.
Anonymous
They're saying that we just gave her that role in the PCP drama CD.
Don't look at it any more.
But I can't just ignore it!
All you've genuinely done is work hard towards your dreams.
Why do they have to talk about you both like you're trash?
Thanks.
Your feelings are enough for me.
The anime staff will come here on February 9.
If they're aware of this uproar, they may keep Azuki from getting the role.
Are you okay with rumors like these destroying your dreams?
Okay, manuscript looks good.
Um, everything's going to be okay, right?
What exactly?
Azuki Miho getting the role of Naho.
Oh, that.
You haven't done anything wrong. There's no cause to worry.
But, this issue has gotten bigger than I ever imagined...
I apologize on our behalf for Kitami's inexcusable actions.
I'm really sorry.
Azuki Miho is at the height of her popularity!
Of all the times to do this
Boss!
What? You never raise your voice.
Please don't be so hard on Kitami.
She didn't mean any harm.
How can you tell?
We've worked together before, so I know.
She always seemed very friendly towards me.
Thank you.
I never imagined this would cause such a problem.
It's okay.
It's true that we're in a relationship.
If it ends up clashing with my job as a voice actress, that's too bad.
It's my weakness.
You can't! You mustn't acknowledge that you have a boyfriend!
I know!
During this week's radio broadcast, you'll firmly deny that you're dating anyone!
Understood?
Thank you for coming all the way out here.
We apologize that it's so cramped and messy in here.
No problem. It's not that different from an anime studio.
I'm the producer, Konaka.
I'm the director, Ehara.
And here we have the screenwriter Oobayashi, who will be adapting the script,
and Tamiya, the character designer and art director.
I'm Oobayashi, nice to meet you.
I'm Tamiya, nice to meet you also.
Thanks, same to you.
Let's all work well together.

And so, we'll respect the original work
and try to follow it as closely as possible.
Okay.
We would appreciate that.
If you have any requests, please let us know.
A-About the voice actors...
Saikou.
I want Azuki Miho to play Naho.
Not to be rude, sir, but are you aware of the internet rumors about this?
Yes.
Azuki Miho and I are in a relationship.
So they were true.
In that case, we must be careful about giving her that role.
Why?
She fits the image of Naho.
And she's a top-class voice actress among her age group.
Takagi.
Considering the current situation, we'd get accused of favoritism if she got the role.
There are people who frown upon the idea of Mr. Mashiro and Ms. Azuki in a relationship.
That might negatively affect the anime.
We will decide the roles through auditions, just as we originally planned.
Of course, if you say you want us to consider Azuki Miho, we will.
But we will offer the role of Naho to the candidate most suited to the character.
Director, that wouldn't...
Well, I respect your feelings as well as the authors', but...
The director may have said so,
but if the producer is that against it, I wonder how this'll end up.
Who has more influence, anyway? The producer or the director?
It'll be fine!
Azuki will definitely get the role through her acting skill.
There's no doubt about it!
Who are you trying to convince, Saikou?
You think there's no chance, don't you?
No, I don't!
The anime staff came
to our studio today.
I clearly told them that
you and I are in a relationship.
The director said that the role would
still be decided through auditions.
Maybe I shouldn't have let
on that we were really dating?

Miho, can I come in?
Sure.
Are you okay?
Miho, you and Mashiro are both chasing your dreams together, right?
I've told you this before, but I once exchanged correspondence with a man,
but nothing came of it.
So
That man was Mashiro's uncle, Kawaguchi Tarou. Right?
You knew?
For how long?
Since our third year in high school.
Knowing that just made me want to be with Mashiro more.
Maybe he feels the same way.
Miho, I'm cheering you on.
I feel proud that my own daughter has such a wonderful romance.
Three minutes before we air.
Listen up! You have to say We're not dating!
and That was a false rumor started by a boy I went to middle school with!
Okay?!
Boss, calm down!
If you can't put this rumor to rest, your life as a voice actress is over!
You're exaggerating.
He just wants to sell her as a perfect voice actress.
You should do what your boss said and deny it.
For your own sake.
What?
Deny that you're in a relationship?
Yeah.
Her boss told her to say that on today's radio broadcast.
But denying it will make you both feel complicated about the whole thing.
That's how it has to be.
It's better for her this way.
Five seconds.
Four, three, two...
Good evening.
This is Azuki Miho.
Everyone, do you have dreams?
Hey, at least follow the cues.
Those of you who are working towards a dream...
Those of you who are searching for one...
I'm cheering you on.
What are you doing? Deny it already!
I am dating the manga author Mashiro Moritaka, the artist of the Ashirogi Mutou duo.
Quickly, cut to a commercial!
But we just started!
I love Mashiro Moritaka!
Before I became a voice actress
Okay, keep going.
and before he became a manga author,
we made a promise in our third year of middle school.
That one day, the manga he drew would become an anime,
and that I'd play the lead female role in it.
And if that dream came true, we'd get married.
That's the dream we've both held dear for so long.
Miho.
Typical Azuki.
It's been our dream since our third year of middle school.
Perhaps this isn't something I should have told my fans who have supported me,
but I don't want to lie to my precious fans.
I've decided to tell my fans the truth.
Okay, cut to commercial.
Azukyun Night!
Yes... Yes...
Hey, don't screen each individual call at a time like this.
A girl in tears is saying that she supports Azuki!
People on the net are saying that they're touched
Really?
Azuki?
After the break, can I put some calls from the listeners through?
They say they're supporting you.
Doing something like that on a live broadcast
Please put them through.
I want to properly face my fans.
I don't want to run from this.
Okay. We'll choose some calls to put through.
We are receiving many calls from all of you.
Today, I would like to talk to as many of you as I can.
Good evening. Your name and age?
Tokumei Kibou, 22 years old.
I work in an office.
I'm touched by what you saidYeah, like hell I am!
Idiot!
Th-That's so mean.
Will Azuki be fine?
I'm sorry for hurting you.
But thank you for letting me know your true feelings.
Just stop this already!
She's shaking.
She's shaking. Just look at her.
Even so, she's fighting all alone.
The next one's a girl who says she was really moved by the story. I think this one will be okay.
Okay, put it through.
I'm Sara, a 18 year old student.
I was so touched by your announcement that you're in a relationship.
Thank you.
Azukyun, you've been dating him since middle school, right?
Yes.
But since graduating from middle school,
I've only seen him when he was hospitalized and two other times.
So, you haven't seen him at all other than that?
Right.
And I've only called him about 10 times.
The rest of our correspondence consists only of text messages.
Really?
That's because we decided we wouldn't meet until our dreams came true.
That's great!
But since your fans are mostly guys, aren't you afraid that you're going to lose some fans over this?
Can we fit in one more?
Yes.
But this call is...
Azuki, this is the last call.
The next call will be the last.
I apologize to all the other callers I couldn't talk to.
Good evening. Your name and age?
Mashiro Moritaka, manga author. 24 years old.
Mashiro?
If this is your real boyfriend, you should tell your listeners.
Everyone, this is the person I am dating, Mashiro Moritaka.
I couldn't sit still after hearing all this.
She's trying so hard.
Please let me say something, too.
Azuki Miho is a voice actress!
Please believe in her voice!
You should be able to tell if all her performances
were lies or not!
I believe that Azuki Miho can get the role with her skills alone!
That's all I wanted to say!
Mashiro, I...
will pass the audition.
