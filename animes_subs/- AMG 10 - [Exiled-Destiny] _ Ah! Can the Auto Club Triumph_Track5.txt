Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
Who is that girl?
So beautiful...
And she moves in such mysterious ways...
The more I find out about her, the more she enchants me!
I'll do it!
I'm going to steal you away from that guy if it's the last thing I do!
Or my name isn't Toshiyuki Aoshima!
Oooh! AAA! Mr. Aoshima!
Ah! Can the Auto Club Triumph?
RECRUITING NEW MEMBERS
Please? Just check us out!
Please, anyone!
The Auto Club is currently seeking new members!
Please, anybody! Please stop by!
Not a soul has stopped by yet.
No wonder...
Come hither, youths! Come to the Auto Club!
You'll find the answers to all your dreams! Come to the Auto Club!
Hey, freshman!
If you join the Club now, I'll personally honor you with my special dance!
No, thank you!
What did you say?
Den-chan, dance for him! Dance for him!
Right!
Come hither, youths! Come to the Auto Club!
You'll find the answers to all your dreams and hopes...
Man, it's pretty lonely over here, isn't it?
Did you sign up any new members?
Nope, not even one!
No wonder, with seniors like those...
Hey! Why don't you join?
Sorry, but I've already joined the softball team!
Oh, you have?
There's just been too few people stopping.
Usually we get a few students who are into cars coming over.
What's that over there?
Oh, that's the Auto Club.
I heard you might as well skip them and join the Four Wheels Club instead.
They've got a lot of girls!
Huh? Seriously?
Four Wheels Club? I've never heard of that club.
Come to think of it, I saw some skanky people making a lot of noise.
I think it was somewhere over there...
The NIT Four Wheels Club is currently seeking new members!
Join now, and you'll receive a free invitation to...
Count me in! Me, too!
Since when do we have a club like this?
We'll have to give a little extra effort, then!
Let's go, Den-chan!
I'm with you, Dai-chan!
They're just gonna drive away even more people...
All right, then! I'll just give them a boost with my sexual charm!
That's not what we need, either...
But we have an Auto Club.
Why are they doing this? It's like a personal attack!
In order to get rid of the Auto Club, that's why!
Aoshima!
A dingy club like yours is an embarrassment to our institution.
I've established the Four Wheels Club with...
Who you callin' dingy, hey?
We clean out our club room!
Yes, at least once a year...
I think the Auto Club is a wonderful club!
Gotcha!
Then I'd like to propose a challenge...
Challenge?
Whichever club loses the next Intercollegiate Rally agrees to break up.
How does that sound to you?
We accept your challenge.
Belldandy?
Are you quite sure? If you lose, your club will have to disband.
Um, that's not...
I understand.
All right... may the best team win!
Certainly.
Hey, hold on a second!
Belldandy...
You don't have to worry. We won't lose.
She is absolutely right!
Our Auto Club cannot suffer defeat at the hands of those newcomers.
Absolutely not!
But how can we race with no machine?
If we don't have one, we'll build one.
We don't have the parts.
We'll buy them!
But we have no money...
We've got the 500-yen savings fund we started last year!
That disappeared somewhere, cookie jar and all.
Morisato!
What?
Willpower!
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
We'll show them what the Auto Club's made of!
I should've seen this coming...
Let's just do our best, Keiichi.
Hey, kiddo, it must be great to be young!
Betcha you don't get much sleep at night if you're with a girl like that!
Huh?
But why wouldn't he get much sleep if he's with me?
Uh... well...
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
You'll find it here.
All right, everyone start looking around!
Right!
Thanks. You were a huge help to us.
If we can find the parts we need, everything will work out okay.
Oh, really?
Yeah. At the very least, I think we can enter the race.
But...
Yes?
We had to rely on your help after all.
But that's not true.
You came this far because everyone in the Auto Club worked so hard!
But...
Eureka!
All right!
You see?
Listen, can I ask you something?
Certainly!
What made you take on the challenge?
No matter how you look at it, the odds are against us.
That's true. The odds may indeed be against us...
But you and Mr. Tamiya and the others have such love for...
I don't see how people like you could ever lose. That's what I'd like to believe.
Belldandy...
Well, now, I can feel romance in the air!
Urd!
Keiichi, this is when you put your arms around her shoulders!
Urd!
Come now, don't be so bashful!
Urd!
Like this... see? It's not hard!
This is it, eh?
Oh my God!
Who the hell did this?
Come on, show yourself! I'll trash YOU!
My name is Belldandy.
In the name of the Shards of Glass, reveal the identity of those...
How obvious is that?
Well, well! Whoever did this showed no mercy!
Aoshima!
What are you doing here?
I was told that the Auto Club's machine had been destroyed.
But, leaving it unguarded here was practically...
You bastard!
Was it you who smashed up this car, built with all our blood, sweat and tears?
Hold on, do you have a shred of evidence that I committed this act?
Judging by the extent of the damage, you have no hope of repairing it in time.
I suppose there's no way out of it. Shall we forget about the challenge?
Do you really mean that?
Yes... but not without any strings attached.
Morisato, you will apologize to me right now, in front of everyone.
Do that, and we can just forget about the challenge.
I know all I need to know about your personality.
You're a coward who'd never rise to a challenge if it seemed too foolhardy.
If your true colors are exposed in front of Belldandy...
I can't miss with this scenario.
What's it going to be?
It's a far better option than suffering public humiliation in the race, is it not?
Morisato...
Forget it!
Keiichi?
We won't be defeated by the likes of you!
Good for you, Morisato!
Damn right! You got that?
We'll let you off if you apologize to us now.
Your bravado will prove worthless!
Keiichi... Your bravado will prove worthless!
No matter how hard you try, there's no way...
W-What?
We will win this contest, no matter what.
Kindly leave us now.
Please excuse me.
You were actually pretty cool just now.
You think so?
But losing's not an option anymore, you know.
Because that guy really made Belldandy angry.
Angry? Belldandy's angry?
She doesn't look mad...
Just watch this.
Belldandy?
Yes?
Oh, that's right!
I made lunch for all of you today, and...
Belldandy, about the race... I made lunch for all of you today, and...
Belldandy, about the race...
We shall win!
But with no car...
We shall win! But with no car...
And no time...
We shall win! And no time...
We shall win no matter what!
You agree with me, don't you, Keiichi?
Uh... sure.
Now you know what the consequences will be if you lose, don't you?
Y-Yes...
Go get'em! I'll be cheering you on!
Show them how tough you are!
Keiichi! Win this thing, now!
Come on, Kei! Keiichi! Win this thing, now!
How's it looking?
Well, what do you want me to say?
It's no good!
Our adjustments are still incomplete. We shouldn't be racing this thing!
Idiot!
The NIT Auto Club Off-Road Special is in perfect condition!
We attached a front wheel system, making this a Three-Wheel-Drive rig!
It has vented disc brakes as well as an independent rear suspension...
We constructed the body from lightweight FRP.
Not to mention this high-end steering column and car stereo!
Plus this trendy vanity mirror attached to the sun visor!
With all this, what else in blue blazes could you ask for?
But this course is riddled with extreme ups and downs.
And there are even sand dunes!
It would be suicidal to try and race in an incomplete three-wheel rig like this!
No way is it incomplete!
Never mind.
I'll just have to compensate with my driving...
But, Morisato!
I'll take it as far as I can.
We stayed up all night fixing this machine. Our love will make it run.
That's the spirit, Morisato!
What are you doing? That's the spirit, Morisato!
Let's send you off with our cheerleader dance!
So they managed to fix it in time, eh?
What are you going to do?
Not to worry. I've planned for this contingency.
Blue Island here. Put Plan A into action!
Roger.
Here we go!
It is now five minutes before the race. All teams, start your engines!
Oh, no, I'm running late, I'd better hurry!
It's locked!
Is there anyone there who can help me?
Where the heck is she? If she doesn't show up before the race begins...
Next, No.!...we'll be disqualified.
The Nekomi Institute of Technology Four Wheels Club!
All right!
I've hired a professional off-road racer for this race.
Of course, you guys will be disqualified before the race starts!
Next, No. 16!
I don't see Belldandy! Next, No. 16!
NIT Auto Club! What's going on?
NIT Auto Club!
NIT Auto Club! No way...
He's up to something again!
Where are you, No. 16, NIT Auto Club?
You'll be disqualified!
What am I gonna do?
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Belldandy!
No. 16, are you dropping out of this race?
No, we're on our way now!
Impossible! How could she have escaped from that trap?
That's what I've been saying all along! She's a world-class escape artist.
Who does she think she's dealing with?
There are plenty more traps where that came from!
Decrease average to 40 and go 50R to the left and go to 70 once you're past it.
I would, but I can't tell how fast I'm going!
Keiichi!
What the... the steering wheel's suddenly...
This voice... it's the car's voice!
Your front wheel's about to go? All right, then.
It's back to normal.
What next, Belldandy?
Right, you need to go right 100R.
Announcing checkpoint times for Checkpoint No. 2!
Currently leading the pack is No. 4, the NIT Four Wheels Club.
But of course...
In 2nd place, currently 10 minutes behind, is the NIT Auto Club.
Despite having the smallest vehicle...
Damn those pesky bastards! With that patched-up machine of theirs?
That guy's up to no good again, isn't he?
I'd better keep my eyes open!
They'll be here any second now.
Make sure they don't see you.
Roger!
It's the steering wheel this time!
It's fixed!
I've used too much power. But we don't have much farther to go...
Belldandy, what's coming up next?
Belldandy?
Huh?
Ouch...
Belldandy? Belldandy!
Wake up, Belldandy!
Urd!
You really are high-maintenance, you know that?
We're in big trouble! Belldandy's...
I can see that.
She's fallen into her dormant state, that's all.
What?
It looks like she used up a lot of power. She's not waking up any time soon.
Power?
This clunker was on its last legs.
So she's been using her power to keep it from breaking down.
Is that what was going on?
It's a shame, but at this point, I guess you have no choice but to give up.
But you and the others have such love for the Auto Club...
I don't see how people like you could ever lose. That's what I'd like to believe.
So what are you going to do, Keiichi?
No! I won't give up!
Because I know Belldandy believes in me!
Attaboy!
Here's your reward.
Urd...
Morisato, what's going on?
Morisato here. Is that you, senior?
I'm at Point B8 right now.
Right, gotcha!
Morisato, turn right.
You must bear to your right!
Right?
Now passing the 3rd and final checkpoint...
The NIT Four Wheels Club remains in the lead!
The course is now buried in sand due to strong winds.
The vehicle in 2nd place is trailing over 30 minutes behind. Hold on a minute!
This information just in...
Another machine can be seen hurtling over the sand dunes!
Well, now! It's the NIT Auto Club!
What the... that's not possible!
All right!
Morisato!
But why would there be a road like this here?
It's not a road... it's a protective bulkhead.
Bulkhead?
There are bulkheads buried along the coastline in this sand dune.
I see!
Only a three-wheeler can navigate such a narrow path!
The race is yours to win now!
Right!
Oh my God!
Shit!
They've crossed the finish line!
1st Place, NIT Auto Club!
Dai-chan!
Den-chan!
Kei, you were awesome!
How the hell...
Why?
When are you gonna learn?
Keiichi would never lose to you!
Now then, time for me to punish you again!
Hey, I didn't do anything!
Keiichi, how did the race go?
We won!
We owe it all to you, Belldandy, for believing in us.
No, you won because everyone played a part in it.
Yeah, I guess it's thanks to everyone!
Congratulations, Keiichi!
Belldandy...
Ah, such a romantic atmosphere!
All right, this is when you put your face next to hers and...
Urd!
Come on, don't be so shy.
Stop it! Come on, don't be so shy.
Urd!
Would it kill you to cling to each other?
One day when I woke up...
A day like any other... another one just beginning.
There you are, yawning... your face is still so sleepy.
Because each peaceful day we share is a miracle to me.
This is where my heart will always return...
Forever...
There's only one thing I wish for.
I chase after the same dream, wherever it may go.
The love I feel for you gives me strength.
May tomorrow be as joyful as today...
That's my wish...
A demon has been summoned from the Dark Realm.
She's out for revenge on the goddesses, changing the human into a strange form.
Next episode: Ah! The Demon Arrives and Wreaks Havoc?
Huh? Don't tell me I'm gonna be like this forever?
