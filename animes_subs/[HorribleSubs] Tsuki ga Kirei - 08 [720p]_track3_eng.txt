I didn't know you were in a relationship, Akane.
Miu messaged me on LINE.
Why?
She was in my class in first year.
The news is spreading?
No way...
I mean, even I'm getting messages about it now.
School check-in day could be rough.
You're going to get so much attention.
Isn't it next week?

Dazai once said, There is such a thing as love in this world. I'm sure of it.
It's the expression the etiquette of love that is so hard to find.
What? Seriously?
Yeah, Azumi and Mizuno.
No way!
For real?
I know!
Dude, Kota! Holy crap!
You're famous!
Is it sexy? Is it sexy?
You dating? You dating?!
Morning.
Morning!
Akanecchi!
Over here.
B-But...
Just come.
Hey, Akanecchi.
Yeah?
Why Azumi?
Miu, harsh!
But I had no idea.
Sorry.
Hey, what do you like about him?
Well...
What? Nothing?
Nothing?
There's obviously something.
No, it's...
I don't know.
But you like him anyway?
I totally thought it would be Hira.
I know.
Me, too.
No more secrets, okay?
Okay.
Let me know if you guys kiss.
I don't think Azumi can do it.
I don't think he has the guts.
Please submit your summer break homework if you've finished it.
Summer School

Be sure to keep up the pace.
Aren't you going home together?
She has practice.
So wait for her.
You're the literature club president, aren't you?
Yeah.
Mizuno-san!
I have club, too.
Okay.
Here we go.

What flavor...
H-Hey, I...
Gotta go?
Yeah.
Are you going home together?
Yeah.
Okay.

I really don't get it.
Akane-chan.

That hits the spot.
You old fart.
Well, it's so hot.
Is your club keeping you busy?
Very.
It's every day.
Wow.
And the literature club?
We just do whatever.
Plus, I have summer lessons and festival prep.
Oh, right. Cram school.
Yeah.
I guess I'll start that after I retire from track.
In the fall?
Yeah.
Sorry.
I found the book you were looking for
I'll be there after practice
Got it
Thank you
Can you make it to practice?
There's something I want to work on
What's up?
He's asking if I can come to practice today.
For the hayashi?
Yeah.
I want to see!
Can I come with you?
Sure, I guess.
Yay!
Sorry, would I be bothering you?
No, not at all.
Let's take it from the top.
Okay.
Well, this is unusual.
Who might you be?
Hello.
Kotarou's girlfrie
Hey!
His girlfriend!
Oh, so this is your girlfriend, huh?
Here.
Man...
If you want...
Thanks.
What did you think?
It was so good.
I've never seen it before. I loved it.
Great.
Sorry to call you out during your time together.
It's fine.
Oh, yeah, Hikawa Shrine...
They have wind chimes right now.
I've never been there.
It's awesome.
Good work today.
Hang on.
Here.
Just take it.
But...
I'll take care of locking up.
I'm here.
I told my mom I was going to the festival, and she had me put it on.
What do you think?
Y-You look great.
Thanks.
So much potato stuff.
Kawagoe's known for them.
Yeah.
Yum.
We have them at my place all the time.
Lucky.
I used to hate them. They're so old-fashioned.
I like them now, though.
I have one of these.
It feels really nice. Try it.
You're right.
I want one, too.
Aw, these are cute!
They're so adorable!
I like Japanese-style stuff.
Yeah?
It suits you.
Fortunes?
When's your birthday?
August 7th.
It's already past!
Why?
Why what?
You should have told me!
I didn't know.
We didn't do anything to celebrate.
It's fine.
Aw, man...
No one's ever celebrated it since it's during summer break.
I'm going to go call home again.
Home?
Smartphone Covers
Japanese Patterns
Money...
I'm back.
Done?
Yeah.
Um...
Let's go.
They're so pretty.
I've never been here before.
It's amazing.
Yeah.
Apparently you can write wishes on the chimes.

Sorry, I didn't have time to choose, so it's the same as mine.
Wow... I love it.
Wait, did you just go buy it earlier?
Yeah.
Wow!
I'm glad you like it.
I didn't know when to give it to you, or if you'd even like it.
I couldn't stop thinking about it.
The whole time I was thinking, Wow, the wind chimes are pretty,
my heart was pounding.
I'm glad I could give it to you, though.
Th... Thanks, Akane-chan.
Can I call you that?
Yeah.
And I'll call you Kotarou-kun.

Don't be late!!
I've never seen Azumi and Akanecchi talking, have you?
Azumi's pretty plain.
Come on, what do you like about him?
Azumi-kun kind of keeps to himself, but I feel really safe when I'm with him.
Have you changed, Akanecchi?
They say people change when they fall in love.
Has anything happened?
Tell us!
No secrets, remember?
I wish for us to be together forever

Kotarou's Parents
Novels?
I was cleaning Kotarou's room, and I found his half-finished novels.
You read them?
I haven't read them yet.
I can't condone you reading them, even as his mom.
There must be rules against that.
You think so?
You've got a pretty good grasp of how women think.
He really doesn't understand how women think.
