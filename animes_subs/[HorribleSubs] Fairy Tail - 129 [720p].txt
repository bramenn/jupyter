How's it going, Lucy-neesan? Have you found the ancient letters?
Nope. I'm not having any luck at all...
Lucy, we've got work.
We're going off to capture some gold-stealing bandits.
Don't tell me it's the Jiggle Butt Gang again?
I dunno, but we'll find out along the way.
Sorry, I'm gonna take a pass this time.
We haven't gotten any farther with deciphering the writing
that appeared on the iron rod...
Where's Natsu?
I don't know. It looks like he went out somewhere.
That's it then. The two of us will go.
Yeah...
Wait a second! By the two of us, you mean just you and me, Erza?
Do you have a problem with that?
Well, I, uh...
No, no problem.
If everything goes smoothly, we should be home by this evening.
Let's get a move on.
There is a problem, Gray-sama...
In the first place, why didn't you invite Juvia?
How thoughtless!
Not even one bite...
Our lunch is on the line here, so take it more seriously!
Alright, leave it to me...
Wake up!
You want something?
I've got a little bone to pick with the members of Fairy Tail...
You're one of them, aren't you?
What if I am?
What if you are? Then I'll flatten you like a pancake!
Pain in the ass...
That's...
It has to be...
What's wrong?
It's Laxus.
That bastard! I was wondering where he went off to,
but it looks like he's been livin' around here!
But Laxus is still in exile.
You probably saw something else!
I'm gonna check it out!
Natsu!
Wait for me!
Raging Battle! Natsu vs. Laxus!
Gajeel!
Salamander!
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?!
Wherever I want!
Same here!
Don't follow me!
You get outta my face!
Oh yeah?!
You wanna have a go?!
Cut it out, both of you!
The idea was to check out the source of that lightning, right?
Yeah, and if it's Laxus, I'm gonna have a showdown with him!
You wouldn't be able to beat Laxus yet!
After all, that one time...
I totally pitched in and even then, look what happened.
Shut up! I didn't need your help then!
Next time, I'm gonna win for sure!
No, I'm gonna win!
That's enough out of you two.
Laxus?!
It really was Laxus!
Laxus!
What, Natsu is here too?
And Gajeel?!
Stop carrying on like little kids.
Laxus, you're livin' around here?
The place I moved to just happens to be near here.
Then you oughta come back to the guild.
Mind your own business.
I don't give a crap if you come back or not.
But since you're here, let's settle once and for all who's stronger!
With me too.
I know your game.
You wanna piss me off so I'll battle you, but I'm not gonna bite.
You gonna run away?
'Scuse me?
You ain't the kinda guy that backs down when someone picks a fight, are you...
What are you trying to pull, Natsu?
Fine.
Alright!
Laxus doesn't have to fight.
Your opponents are the Raijinshuu.
Our fate is joined with Laxus!
No, no. My own fists will pound some sense into their thick skulls.
Music to my ears!
Alright, Natsu. I'll start with you.
Stop right there!
Wendy...
I think something like this should be carried out with a plan!
A plan?
What are you talking about?
The showdown is tomorrow!
I don't know what you mean, but fine.
Alright, our battle's tomorrow.
Let's have it at the Sola tree in the South Gate Park!
And you fight me after that.
Whatever...
A duel, seriously?!
Those two never learn their lesson...
I guess Laxus has been living in a corner of Magnolia.
Who cares about that?! Showdowns are a Man!
But are Natsu and Gajeel going to be okay?
Look, you...
Well, I don't think there is any way you can have a safe battle with Laxus...
Is Laxus really that strong?
Strong, hell. When he was part of the guild,
he was probably only second to Gildarts when it came to strength.
Okay! As Master here, it's my duty to liven this up!
Festival, I say! Festival!
Festivals are a Man!
That's a great idea! It's a rare occasion, so let's have fun with it!
Agreed!
Hey!
What the heck is this?! There's a festival goin' on?!
Looks like everyone's having a good time!
You're the cause of this!
This is wonderful! There are so many food stands!
You've really got an appetite tonight...
What's this festival about?
We heard the news about your duel...
They said it's a festival to get pumped up about the main event tomorrow.
Huh...
It's really because everyone here loves a good festival.
Well, we haven't been getting anywhere with those ancient letters,
so this is a perfect way for us to let off some steam, too...
That over there looks delicious, too!
Cool! Cool! Coool!
Long time no see, everyone! Your reporter Jason here, from Weekly Sorcerer!
Meeting again after seven years! And a festival to celebrate a duel!
I've been waiting for this day to come!
Pipe down!
Just get the show on the road!
Alright, alright, let me introduce the guest you've all been waiting for...
The eternal songstress, Mirajane!
Yay!
You're gonna get some rock tonight.
Attagirl, Neechan!
Do it up!
That's what I had in mind, anyway, but I've got a sore throat...
Natsu, shouldn't you do something to get ready for tomorrow's fight?
Not necessary.
All I gotta do is pound the hell outta him with the power I've got.
I see. So you haven't put any thought into it at all...
Come to think of it, I wonder what Gajeel's up to...
That bastard hates to lose,
so he's probably off doin' some special training somewhere.
And so, I would like to introduce a soulful singer in my stead!
Take it away!
That's Gajeel!
That's special training?!
Thanks for comin' here tonight on my behalf.
We didn't come for you!
Well, since you demanded it, I'm gonna favor you with an original song!
Nobody demanded it!
Listen up now, to... Best Friend!
That again?!
Colorful, colorful... Shooby doo bop!
Tremble with love, steel grey metallic!
A guitar and a white suit just doesn't go with Gajeel...
And his song is weird, too...
Yeah, right?!
Levy-chan, you're back?!
Yeah. I was out on my first job with Shadow Gear for a long time.
Bite into it, hard! Sweet honey...
Actually, there are some characters I'd like you to figure out, Levy-chan!
Thank you!
Guess we'll camp out here for the night...
Even though I thought we'd have this wrapped up while it was still light out...
At least we know where their hideout is.
All we have to do now is wait'til they come back with the gold.
Right...
Still, this is awkward...
Being alone with Erza...
It's like we've got nothing to say to each other...
Gray...
Aren't you going to strip?
You can sleep better in the buff, yes?
Where is this going?!
Yeah, well, it depends on my mood...
I mean, look at you, still wearing your armor...
Now that you mention it... Good point.
Gray...
To bed.
Y-Yeah...
What's happening here?! What's happening here?!
Telling him right out, To bed?!
Oh, if only he said it like that to Juvia...
Juvia, let's go to bed.
This is no time to be imagining that!
She's sleeping already?
Jeez, doesn't she have even an ounce of caution?
Yeesh. She's got a pretty face when she's quiet like this...
They're back.
R-Right...
Let's go.
Alright!
Thank goodness nothing happened...
Halt!
Who the hell are you?!
I'm Erza Scarlet of Fairy Tail!
I don't think there's any need to introduce ourselves to these bums.
We're here by request of the owner of that gold you stole.
Don't bother resisting. Just hand over the gold.
We thought something like this could happen,
so we hired a couple bodyguards!
That's your cue!
If you want a big chunk of the loot, do a good job, gentlemen!
Good evening.
We're the notorious Vanish Brothers!
Vanish Brothers... I've heard of you.
If I recall, you're the guys Natsu beat the hell out of
at Duke Everlue's mansion.
That was a long time ago.
Since then, we've had so much training that we're powerful enough
to face even Erza of Fairy Tail without fear.
Amusing. Yes, show us how powerful a mercenary guild is.
No, I'm going to handle these two alone.
What?!
Natsu beat you by himself, didn't he? Then naturally, so will I.
Brother, this guy is making light of us.
Cool down. Think of this as business only. Don't take it personally.
Anyway, all we have to do is beat him to a pulp, right?
Yes. Come on!
Ice Make...
An ice wizard, eh?
My Frying Pan has always been able to absorb fire attacks...
It also doubles the power it catches, converts it, and spurts it back out!
That's not gonna touch me!
He's got game.
Bro, let's go with the you-know-what!
Finishing Move: Destruction of Heaven and Earth!
Face toward heaven and...
Face the earth and...
No one can escape...
Natsu defeated them before, but have they improved these past seven years?
Gray-sama! Juvia will help you!
Stay out of this!
I'm not...
Shut up! Here comes the finishing blow!
If you're comin' at me from the heavens and earth,
I've got something for you both!
Icebringer!
Why, you...!
That's my Gray-sama...
I guess Gray's also gotten better...
These guys shouldn't have given you that much trouble.
I wanted to have a little fun with it.
We're going to return the gold you stole to its rightful owner.
You have no complaints, do you?
N-No, of course not!
Now Juvia can go home with peace of mind.
What's all this hullabaloo about?
Not every day you have a showdown, Laxus,
so everyone's been making a big to-do about it since last night.
They're probably happy about getting the chance to see you again after so long.
They're fools as always...
But that's Fairy Tail.
You know that more than anyone, Laxus!
I'm not too sure about that...
Would you buy this for me?!
Alright, alright...
What should I do?
I told them to have the fight today to give them time to cool off...
Not expecting it would become a major event, huh?
Yes, this isn't what I had in mind at all!
Is something wrong?
Master!
We were looking for you all over! Where were you?!
Has something happened?
Natsu-san and Gajeel-san are going to have a duel with Laxus-san!
Say what?!?
Coool!
We have Laxus waiting patiently, as dignified as you'd expect!
And there he is! Gajeel is in the house!
The combatants glare at each other! There's tension in the air...
And now Natsu is here!
All the pieces are in place!
Watch this, Happy.
Aye, sir!
Laxus stands up!
Apparently, he's heading for Natsu first!
You ready?
Yeah.
I don't have to hold back at all, do I?
'Course not!
Not gonna be my fault if you snuff it.
The same goes for you, Laxus!
Happy, get back.
Give him what-for, Natsu!
Oh, I will.
There they go!
Incredible feeling of tension...
Whoever makes the first move will lose...
It's over?!?
Done with a single blow, huh?
The usual instant kill, right?
Natsu!
I figured this would happen, Laxus!
This is what you call a difference in skill level.
You're up next, right?
Huh?
Oh, no! Gajeel has disappeared?!
Don't tell me that bastard has run off!
What?!
Comb the hills! No way are we gonna let him escape!
Combing the hills is a Man!
I've lost respect for you! Gajeel!
Natsu, are you okay?
I've got it!
This is in ancient Potamelian.
I've never heard of that.
So what's it say, Levy-chan?
Time is etched and then chaos descends.
Time is etched...
I've heard that phrase before somewhere...
Where?
Umm... Uh...
Wait, Laxus!
Come back to Fairy Tail!
Master! It's about time you lifted Laxus's expulsion!
Master!
Not here... Not here either...
This is the one! It's from here!
The phrase time is etched and then chaos descends appears in this book.
What's the context?
Um, let's see...
It's a story about a clock that follows a strange destiny
through the ages as it's passed on from one person to another.
It's this pendulum clock!
What's wrong?
Look at this drawing!
This isn't just some rod...
It's the hand of a clock!
Does it still hurt?
This is nothin'!
Ow...
Where did that bastard Gajeel hide?!
Macao and the others are searching, but they may not be able to find him.
Has Gajeel come back?!
Hey! Gajeel!
Who are you people?
Who the hell's come to pick a fight with Fairy Tail?!
Huh? Feels like I've seen them somewhere before...
Jeez, Natsu, you've got bad eyes!
These guys were in Edolas!
Really? They looked like this?
Huh? Now that you mention it, they do seem kind of different...
Your eyes are bad too, Happy!
Next time: Targeted Lucy!
It looks like they're after Lucy!
She gets targeted a lot. Why is that?
She's probably behind on her rent or something!
