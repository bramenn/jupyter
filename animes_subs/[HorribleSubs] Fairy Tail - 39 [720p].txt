Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
A past comrade of Erza's, Jellal, is plotting to resurrect Zeref using the Tower of Heaven.
We linked up with Sho and other past friends of Erza's
and somehow managed to defeat Trinity Raven of the Assassin's Guild.
But... Hurry, Natsu! Etherion is about to fire!
What is your real goal?
You haven't really completed the R-system, have you?
I haven't been doing nothing for these past 8 years.
I researched the R-system myself.
It's true there were no errors in the construction or theory of the blueprints back then.
But there is something essential missing from the R-system.
I told you, remember? You are the sacrifice.
A problem more basic than that.
The thing you lack is... magical power!
A Prayer Under the Holy Light
To activate a magical spell of this magnitude, you need a tremendous amount of magical energy.
Even if you assembled every wizard on this continent, I'm not sure it would be enough.
So of course there is no way an individual could store enough energy in this tower.
And moreover, you know about the Council's attack but are not trying to escape.
What are you thinking?
Three minutes until Etherion.
Jellal!
Your dream is already over!
Do you simply wish to die like this?
If that's the case, then we go together.
I will not release this hand until the final moment!
Sure... That doesn't sound too bad.
My body was possessed by Zeref's spirit.
No words will reach me.
I'm nothing but a puppet used for the purpose of resurrecting Zeref.
Possessed?
I wasn't able to save myself.
Not friends nor anyone else could save me.
There is no Heaven... There is no freedom, anywhere.
Everything was over before it even began.
Etherion, final firing phase complete!
Satellite Square, deploy!
No problems with the transference lacrima!
Coordinates, locked.
No signs of rejection from elemental merger.
Begin countdown!
Let us pray...
Let us pray...
Let us pray...
Let us pray...
Let us pray.
That light!
It's Etherion!
Natsu, Erza... Hurry up and escape...
I knew that the R-system wouldn't be able to be completed.
But the spirit of Zeref wouldn't let me go.
It's too late to stop it. I'm a broken engine that he's driving...
Erza, you win.
Please put an end to this.
That's why you came here, yes?
There is no point in delivering the final blow.
The Satellite Square is already deployed above.
It's over. For me... and you...
Always the awkward one...
You're also a sacrifice to Zeref, yes?
This is my punishment for giving in to my weakness.
My heart wasn't able to handle the huge gap between dreams and reality.
Didn't you have friends there to fill in for your weaknesses and deficiencies?
Erza...
I am also repenting for my sin of not being able to save you.
I was...
Let us pray to the holy light!
Release Etherion!
Here it comes!
Natsu! Erza!
This light...
They didn't make it?
Erza!
It's over...
Etherion has hit the target!
Was it successfully destroyed? Hurry and confirm!
Ethernano fusion density increasing!
Predicting extreme weather patterns!
I wonder how many people were in that tower?
It was to stop Zeref from being resurrected. Their sacrifices were not in vain.
Whether or not what we did was the right decision,
that will not bring peace to the victims' families.
No...
Natsu... Erza...
I'm alive?
Jellal?
Ethernano neutralizing around explosion center!
W-Wait, that's...
Fusion density dropping suddenly!
A powerful, different magical energy is manifesting!
The gauge can't keep up!
What is this?
Restore visual!
Crystal?
No, it's magic crystal.
Lacrima!
Hey, they're okay, right? Natsu, Erza, and Simon too?
What the hell is going on?
Etherion fired... So why am I still alive?
Finally... Finally, the time has come!
Why, you...
This is the true form of the Tower of Heaven!
It's a giant lacrima!
And thanks to the attack by the Council's Etherion,
it has absorbed an incredible amount of magical energy!
Now the R-system is complete!
The target is standing!
A giant lacrima!
The lacrima absorbed the magical power from Etherion!
It what?!
Sieg... What is the meaning of this?
He disappeared...
You tricked me?
You were really cute there, Erza.
Jellal was not able to produce his true power.
He was in mortal danger, so he had no choice but to trick you.
Siegrain!
Why are you here?
Remember the first time we met, Erza.
That time you came with Makarov to deliver a written letter of apology to the council, yes?
You mistook me for Jellal and attacked me.
Well, we look identical, so it's to be expected.
After you heard we were twins, you finally were pacified.
However you always treated me as your enemy.
Obviously!
Instead of behaving as an older brother should, you tolerated what Jellal was doing!
Or rather, you were spying on me!
Yes.
That was my mistake.
I should have said something like I will find Jellal and make him stop, no matter what.
I had finally become a member of the council,
so meeting you at all was my greatest mistake.
The lies we tell in an unplanned moment cause us the greatest pain.
So you two really did plot this together.
Together?
No.
That's not it, Erza.
We are a single person.
From the very beginning.
No...
A thought projection?
Yes. Siegrain is me.
So you, yourself, fired Etherion?
That's why you infiltrated the Council?
Did you enjoy your fleeting freedom, Erza?
Everything went according to Zeref's scenario for resurrection.
You fiend... How many people have you deceived in your life?
Power...
A tremendous magical power is building in the Tower of Heaven!
If that magical power is held in one place it'll explode!
We were had.
What is going on?
The building is suddenly aging!
Lost Magic?
Time Ark?
Ultear...
Everything is for Lord Sieg... I mean, Lord Jellal.
Right now, his dream is being fulfilled!
That's the R-system?
Yes, that's the true form of the R-system we built, got it?
It's activating...
Activating? You mean it's resurrecting Zeref?
I don't know. We've never seen it operate.
And Natsu and Erza are inside of it?
Simon as well... And, Jellal...
What happened to your previous strength?
Did you use up too much of your magical power in the battle with Ikaruga?
Jellal!
Right now the Council should be completely paralyzed.
I must be grateful to Ultear.
She did quite well.
She said, If in heaven all are seen as one, then we need not fear even death.
For my ideal, for my dream, she said she'd gladly lay down her own life.
I truly must be thankful to be given stupid women!
You fiend!
You should die from the curses of all those you've used!
What is this?
Bind Snake.
I put it on you when we hugged before.
I have the magical power to activate the R-system.
All I need now is the human sacrifice to resurrect Zeref.
I have no more time to play with you, Erza.
The tremendous amount of magical power this lacrima now stores,
will be fused into your body.
Your body will be deconstructed, and then reconstituted into Zeref's.
I loved you, Erza.
Damn it! Damn!
O Great Zeref...
I give to you this woman's body!
Jellal!
Jellal!
Gotcha.
Erza is a Fairy Tail wizard.
You can't have her.
Natsu...
Sheesh.
What are you doing?
We need to get back and do some work, or the rent won't get paid this month.
Lucy's rent, that is.
Sorry. I can't move.
Oh, yeah?
You used to work me over pretty good!
So take some of this!
Natsu, get away from here as soon as you can.
Not a chance.
If you can't do it, then I'll do it for you.
Stop. He's got the advantage.
You don't know enough about him.
So I can't win unless I do?
Please, listen to me.
What are you...
Erza, I don't know anything about you either.
But... I can win!
You're even more outrageous than the rumors say.
Had enough of hurting your friend when she can't move?
Erza...
She was giving up...
And her voice was shaking...
I don't want to see Erza like that.
Erza should be strong and ferocious!
I want her to be her usual self when she wakes up from this nightmare.
I will fight!
Interesting! Show me the dragon wizard's power!
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
And!
Talons!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Are you being serious?
Natsu Dragneel... The child of Igneel.
I wanted to taste the destructive power of a Dragon Slayer before I destroyed you,
but this is nothing to fear at all.
Say what?!
How dare you interrupt the ceremony...
I will use my Heavenly Body Magic to tear you to shreds!
Meteor!
Damn it! He's too fast!
I shouldn't follow him with my eyes!
Smell, sound, feel...
Predict his movements... Concentrate...
Concentrate!
There!
He's even faster?
Your attacks will never hit me again!
This is the end. I will show you true destructive magic.
Be judged under the seven stars!
Seven Star Blades!
Grand Chariot!
That's a spell that destroys with the power of falling meteors.
I'm impressed your body is still intact.
Perhaps I went a bit overboard.
It would be dangerous to damage the R-system any further.
The magical power is starting to leak out.
I must hurry.
Isn't that right, Erza?
That attack hit.
So breaking this tower, or um, lacrima... That's bad, huh?
Rotten luck for you!
Don't!
Breaking things happens to be Fairy Tail wizards' specialty!
I'm all fired up! More than I've ever been!
You little brat!
Natsu, Etherion has started going out of control!
At this rate everyone will be destroyed!
Damn it! There must be a way!
Erza, what are you doing?
Throwing your body into the lacrima?
Is she attempting to fuse with Etherion and stop it from going out of control?
Stop it!
Next time: Titania Falls
Erza disappeared...
I won't accept it! I won't accept it, damn it!
Erza!
