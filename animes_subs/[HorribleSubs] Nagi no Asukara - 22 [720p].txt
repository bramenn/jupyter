Wow.
It looks delicious.
Oh, Miuna-chan.
Oh, I-I'm going to take a bath now.
It's no use...
Huh?
Episode Twenty-Two: Something Lost
Uroko-sama!
Uroko-sama, where are you?
Is Uroko-sama really on the surface?
Tsumugu hasn't been in the sea,
and yet he got cursed and the fish appeared.
That means he should be somewhere in Oshiooshi.
But where?
I don't know.
Uroko-sama!
Hey!
Come on... it's not like he's a dog or a cat...
Ugh, so gross!
You don't have to look at it.
Will this really work?
Sayu?
Manaka-san?
Can we really catch him with this?
Yeah, probably.
What are you two doing?!
We're planting a porn magazine we found on the shore.
Uroko-sama likes perverted things, and...
Ooh!
You made that for Uroko-sama?
Yeah.
It has bamboo shoots, carrots, and chicken.
I prepared them all separately.
Let me taste it!
Wow, so good!
My grandma's is better, but...
I'll take one more.
Yay, it turned out good.
I wonder if Uroko-sama will come out if we leave this as well.
Yeah, totally.
But he's not a dog or a cat...
But he totally eats things that have fallen on the floor.
Wow, that's awful!
What am I going to do if he has super hairy fingers and emits a pervy aura...
He doesn't have hairy fingers,
but he has scales on his chest and his arms.
Well, I guess they don't call him Uroko-sama for nothing.
The thing you said you'd tell me after the Ofunehiki...
I'll hear it now.
What did you want to say?
Is it about Tsumugu?
Huh?
Isn't it about Tsumugu?
What are you talking about?
What are you staring at so blankly?
Nothing.
It's snowing...
Lately, the salt-flake snow has been falling more frequently.
And according to the news,
it's now falling in towns and cities far from the sea as well.
I wonder where Uroko-sama is...
I guess searching aimlessly won't work.
Is there somewhere on the surface that's connected to the Sea God?
Huh? Um...
No idea.
Do you know anywhere, Miuna?
What?
Oh...
I know there's some old shrine, but...
You're going back to the university, right?
Where is that?
Are you sure you're okay doing this?
South of the beach.
But it's sort of barren...
Finding Uroko-sama is part of our research, too.
Is that place even related to the Sea God, though?
It sounds like a fart.
Yours was like that too.
You totally hated it when it was on your knee.
That's true.
I wonder if it's hungry.
I'm gonna give it some food.
Food? It eats?
It does. Wanna watch?
Gross!
I wanna see!
Oh, Sayu?
Why don't we take a break?
I'll go prepare some tea.
I'll help.
Whoa, it's really coming down!
I wonder if Uroko-sama ate some of the stew.
Um, you had a fish appear on you, too, Manaka-san?
Yeah, I was totally surprised!
After it was gone, you lied and still said it was there.
It's so funny!
Whoa! It totally ate it!
Gross!
It's like a frog! Here!
I got those bean pastries from a patient.
This is so cool!
Huh. From a guy?
Oh, stop. What are you saying?
You're so popular.
Stupid. He's an old man.
I'm kinda jealous.
Maybe I should ask you out again.
Kidding.
Some time passed,
and Mihashi-sensei had to go back to the university earlier than expected.
Because of the bad weather,
the investigations were delayed, and since there were dangers,
he was called back to the university.
Sorry about this.
This is from Chisaki.
To eat on your trip.
That's great!
Thanks.
I kept telling them that this is exactly
why we need to continue our investigations, but...
Is there that much salt-flake snow falling?
It was on the news, wasn't it?
Even cities far inlands are getting heavy snow,
causing problems with the traffic network and power outages.
Are you going back, too, Tsumugu-kun?
No, I'm staying for a little longer.
I see.
Well, there's still some time before the sun sets,
so I'm going to go look for that bastard, Uroko.
Oh, I'll go, too.
Sayu, let's go, too.
Yeah.
Are you staying behind for Chisaki?
Yeah.
And I thought you were going to say that you're staying behind for the investigation.
What's the point in that?
I want an answer, too.
Unsweetened Coffee Zero Sweetness, Bitter and Black Coffee
Yeah...
Don't Hikari and Manaka-san
seem a bit weird to you?
Sayu?
Shiodome, what are you doing?
Well, you know...
I see.
They say it's going to snow again.
It's probably better if you get home soon.
Right. Thanks.
See ya.
Miuna...
Minegishi asked you out, right?
Huh?
Wh-What are you talking about all of a sudden?
Asking out, huh...
Wow!
Hii-kun, Hii-kun, the tupper and the porn magazine are gone!
It has to be Uroko-sama!
You don't know for sure.
Some random old perv could have taken them.
No, it's gotta be Uroko-sama!
So he really is on the surface!
Let's find him.
Uroko-sama, where are you?
Uroko-sama's not around, huh?
When Tsumugu and I raced...
Huh?
And I messed up and got hurt...
Ready...
Ow...
Hii-kun!
You were the first one to dive into the pool, weren't you?
Uh...
You don't remember that either, do you?
What else don't you remember?
Do you even remember the fish coming out of your knee...
Oh, I do remember that!
Really.
But...
What?
I don't remember telling a lie about it still being there.
I-I'm sorry!
I didn't want to worry all of you.
You don't remember?
Oh, but I remember making the Ojoshi-sama with everyone!
It's okay.
I think I'm just a little sleepy still.
When...
When we were told not to go to the surface because it was dangerous...
The fact that I...
The fact that I ended up holding you...
Before everyone was about to hibernate,
when we went to Nami Junior High and I...
I don't understand any of that!
You don't...
You don't remember any of that?
Um...
Hii-kun?
Hey, you octopus!
You pushed a lady and you're just going to leave her?!
Hikari?
Hey, Miuna?
Miuna!
Where are you going, Hikari?
Hey, Hikari!
Go away!
What?
I said, go away!
Hikari!
Ow...
Man, what are you doing?
Sorry...
Th-Thanks.
Huh?
What's wrong?
Fish
I didn't know there was a small shrine here...
What's this?
Oh, S-Sayu said that was for Uroko-sama.
For goodness sake,
you actually thought you could catch me with that?
Apparently I'm rather underestimated.
Uroko-sama!
Tell Mukaido's granddaughter, Manaka...
That hers is still pales in comparison to the old woman's.
When did you come to the surface?
My job is to watch over the people of the sea.
However, everyone's asleep now, so I was rather bored.
So you were keeping an eye on us since we were awake?
Then you should have come out sooner!
I am the scale of the Sea God.
The more I'm in the sea, the more I'm bound...
Hm?
What a wonderful smell.
You have a womanly scent.
Wha
What the hell are you talking about?!
I didn't notice this the other day, but...
Oh, and your Ena's developed quite nicely.
R-Really?
Stop it, you perverted scale!
So, what did you want?
Weren't you looking for me because you wanted to ask me something?
Er, yeah!
Uroko-sama, what's going to happen to the surface?
Is it going to keep getting even more messed up?
And what about everyone in Shishio?
When are they going to wake up?
Is that all you want to ask?
Manaka...
What happened to Manaka?
Is she never going to be able to go back to the sea?
And she's forgotten a lot of stuff from before she fell asleep...
What?
What the hell is happening to her?!
Manaka had become the Ojoshi-sama...
The Ojoshi-sama?!
The girl who became the Sea God's sacrifice
and had his child...
She came while leaving someone she loved on the surface.
Seeing that she was never able to forget those feelings
and started to shut everything out,
the Sea God returned her to the surface...
Taking something in return.
I know that story.
The Sea God took her Ena, right?
What does that have to do with anything?
The Ojoshi-sama returned to the surface,
and many years passed.
The Sea God lost his life,
and his body melted into the sea, becoming one with it.
And one of the scales that fell off at that time is me.
Even now, some of the fragments of the Sea God's emotions
that had melted into the sea still remain.
Fragments of his emotions?
Neither good nor evil.
Rage, sadness, happiness, envy.
All raw emotions.
The sacred fire is also a part of the Sea God,
but it's a bit more structured...
Well, it's something like his consciousness.
It wishes to stop whatever is about to befall the sea and the surface.
However, the fragments of his emotions that remain in the sea
felt the air of the world of humans.
And at times, they become the menace of the sea, acting on their own.
At that time,
Manaka was dragged in by the Sea God's feelings,
and became the sacrifice.
Apparently the feelings when the Sea God
was longing for the Ojoshi-sama had remained.
At the graveyard of Ojoshi-samas,
Manaka was wrapped up in even thicker Ena and became the sacrifice.
Because of that, the sea had calmed itself,
and the end of the surface was halted.
The fragments of emotions that were left in the sea and the sacred fire became one,
and an equilibrium was reached.
However...
a certain sentiment within Manaka did not accept that she was the sacrifice,
and tried to free itself.
That sentiment destroyed her Ena,
and started flowing little by little, creating a small current.
The current that led to Shioshishio?
The tiny grains of Ena that flowed from Manaka bumped into each other,
making a sound,
and that is what the girl from the surface heard.
Then that was...
So that sound was Manaka-san's Ena...
No, Manaka-san's emotions...
Where are Miuna and Hikari-kun?
Not back yet.
I wonder if they're okay...
They're not little kids anymore.
There's nothing to worry about.
When you went to look for Manaka,
the Sea God's fragments of emotions thought that Ojoshi-sama would be taken away,
took something away from Manaka, just as it had done before.
Namaka, rawr!
That is when the Ena protecting Manaka came off all at once.
Rawr!
Because Manaka was the sacrifice, the sea was calm.
Because it lost Manaka,
the end of the surface may come even sooner.
What the hell does that mean?
You're saying that the surface got all messed up
because of Manaka?
So you're saying it was better if Manaka had stayed asleep in the sea forever?!
What the hell?!
What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
Calm down.
Even though I said it may come even sooner,
we're talking about after you die as well as long after your children die.
U-Um...
You said that something was taken,
and that's when her Ena came off...
Then the thing stolen from Manaka-san wasn't her Ena?
Oh, yeah...
Then what...
Hikari, you are in love with Manaka, are you not?
Wh
That doesn't have to do with anything right now!
Your feelings for her may never... reach Manaka.
Actually, no one's may ever reach her.
God damn it!
Hikari?!
The thing that Manaka lost...
is...
Rawr! Boom!
Is...
the heart to fall in love with someone.
All right, how about this?!
I'm not gonna lose!
Take that!
Manaka is now unable to love anyone.
Oh no, you got me!
Miuna-chan, Hii-kun.
Are you doubting Manaka's feelings?!
It's selfish to say that it's better to not be able to love someone!
Well, Manaka looks like she's having fun.
If you lose the ability to love someone...
I won't lose it!
Episode Twenty-Three: Who Do These Feelings Belong To?
I won't lose it...
