How irresponsible.
You don't care if she dies or succeeds?
She won't die, and I don't intend to let her.
She was expensive, after all.
You can neither become human, nor return to being a fairy, you filthy creature.
Do you really think you'll be forgiven for buying a human?
It seems you're still as much of a human supremacist as ever, Renfred.
Why do you know about Chise?
You've never liked auctions, have you?
That event is strictly private.
What happens there is to be kept secret.
Besides, what use do you have for this mass of human rage and regret?
I see.
Who took that arm of yours?
Good work, Chise.
Elias.
Flowers, huh?
You're safe!
That was clever.
Chise isn't all about destruction the way you are.
He looks relieved.
Let's go, Alice.
Master...
Are you leaving?
You still haven't told me anything.
The corruption is gone. I have no further business here.
I don't care how you use the girl.
Be careful.
There are countless people interested in her.
You knew them?
That sorcerer is famous for his distaste for mages.
He's always liked picking fights with me.
He still had both of his arms the last time I saw him, though.
Something's going on.
Are you okay, Chise?
Her magical production circuits must be exhausted.
You can get some sleep.
Thank you.
Elias...
When am I going to die?
You hadn't forgotten, huh?
In three years, maybe, if nothing's done about it.
I've thought of a way to prevent it.
You don't have to worry.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because there was no reason to.
Your death isn't a part of my plans.
So your experiment is to see if you can keep me from dying?
Sure.
To see what will happen if I have a Sleigh Beggy around me, a reservoir of limitless magic.
But you don't need more magic, do you?
So, why me?
I'm half-bakedneither human, fairy, nor spirit.
I've lived for a long, long time, and seen many humans,
but I still don't quite understand any of them, including you.
I can comprehend your thoughts,
but I can't empathize.
I can understand the reasons behind your tears, anger, and laughter,
but I can't make them my own.
I bought you because it was advantageous for me.
That's all.
Because you had nothing, and you couldn't part from the non-human that is me.
I let you hear the words that I suspected you would want to hear, and gave you shelter, food,
knowledge, and attention.
I thought I might learn something if I raised one of you myself.
I did plan on telling you after you'd become completely attached to me.
It's strange.
Though I had to do it earlier, thanks to Renfred.
His facial expression doesn't change.
I know.
If you don't need this memory, I can destroy it for you.
Yet the glimmer in his eyes is like a child's.
There's no need to be scared.
Until you don't need me anymore...
I'll stay by your...
side...
Look at that quality male, being confessed to by a female.
You've impressed me, mage.
I think she meant, You're so pathetic, I can't just leave you.
She touched me for the first time.
It looks like you'll finally have what you've sought, after your long journey.
I'm glad for you.
Shall we return to our home, Chise?
Is this all for today?
Indeed, I hope she wakes up today.
Her breath and her pulse are stable.
It hasn't hurt her physically yet.
Chise may be more capable than I thought.
You're back, Simon?
At least let me worry about her.
Two weeks you've returned from Ulthar, and she's still not awake.
It's to be expected.
She's keeping her physical functions to a minimum,
so she can focus on replenishing the magic she used.
Recovery is faster in the forests or under water than in the city.
She'll awaken soon.
I don't approve of you letting such a child be so reckless.
You're still hiding something, aren't you?
You can tell, huh?
It's been ten years since I was assigned to keep an eye on you.
I can tell when your bony face is pale under your cloth.
Sing, sing, sing.
Ruffle, trees, in the wind,
let not the sunlight pass.
Dance, flowers and grass,
let not your scent be lost for direction.
Sing praise, homeless bird, that the mistress of the night
shall not tear off your wings.
Return to the earth, and sing,
flutter in the skies, and sing,
bow your head to the noble garden and sing,
for the great Gealach of Tir na nOg has arrived.
Well, well, two strapping young men to greet me.
How kind of you both.
My queen, you ought not speak directly with the commoners.
You're so strict.
He is one of my own, Spriggan.
I have no respect to show a being of flesh.
Who is she?
Try not to talk to her too much.
She's the Queen of Faeries.
She commands all of the creatures of the night in Britain.
Titania.
You're perhaps the only one besides my husband that calls me by my name, Thorn.
Where's the king?
He gets rambunctious, so I left him behind.
I wanted to see you and your hatchling today.
Oh?
You worship that foreign god.
You're called a priest, are you not?
Y-Yeah.
Yes, though the scent is faint...
Be gone.
That was uncivil.
He'll merely wander the woods for a while.
I'll return him after the hour of honey mead.
Now, Thorn, would you introduce me to your wife?
Wow, a redhead.
She'll become a great mage.
Oberon... What are you doing?
Shucks, you found me.
You weren't even trying to hide.
Faerie King Oberon.
She's neither a toy nor a doll.
Stand back, please.
What, are you jealous?
You've finally come to that, huh?
I like it.
How manly.
The one who wears a shell of flesh...
Seeing change in a halfling like yourself is splendid.
You'd only been watching from the shadows until now,
but you're trying to end your wandering by having a human nearby.
Watching you act as though you were her parent or mate is quite fun.
Although...
I wonder how long you can keep up your false kindness for this one person.
Ow, ow, ow!
You mustn't bully children, dear.
You're here to see his mate today, aren't you?
You're so soft when it comes to kids, Titania.
Unfortunately, I'm not as unscrupulous as you are.
You're so mean!
Fine.
Let's just hurry up and wake this sleepy-head.
Magic power.
I knew it.
Our robin is beautiful when she opens her eyes.
Good morning, sweet maid who bears the name of birds.
Did you have sweet dreams?
U-Uh...
Who are you?
Morning, Chise.
Elias.
Rejected.
A hatchling's imprinting sure is strong.
She just caught on to how terrible a person you are.
Um...
You were asleep for a while.
How do you feel?
Are you tired or in pain?
Uh, I'm not.
Good.
Sorry to scare you.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Titania, queen of all faeries who live in Albion as well as Tir na nOg
And I'm her husband, Oberon!
Nice to meet you.
Albion?
Tir?
An old name for the island of Great Britain.
Tir na nOg is the land of fairies
Hey, girl, Chise, was it?
You aren't afraid of him?
Are you okay?
Not distressed?
Sure.
Yes, I'm fine.
Oh, yeah?
I'm glad.
Yup.
As long as you aren't scared.
So, do you have kids yet?
Huh?
You're married, aren't you?
Maybe you're too little still.
I bet your child would be an excellent mage.
Kids are cute.
Especially blondes!
Seriously.
We really love blondes.
Spriggan.
Go.
Ow, ow, ow!
Not there, stop! Ow, ow, ow!
I guess he's kind of really stupid.
Pay him no mind.
Do forgive my fool of a husband.
I-Is he all right?
Don't worry.
He's enjoying it.
No!
Oh.
He's one of those people.
Kids?
By kids, does he mean...
Is something the matter?
No.
It's nothing.
Elias?
Nothing, my gut just...
I don't know.
Oh dear, oh dear.
This good-for-nothing makes himself useful once in a while.
I'll be excusing myself now, especially since this idiot is here.
We'll talk another time.
I'm glad I got to meet the hatchling mage.
Come visit us someday.
We'll hold a banquet.
I'll go, if you intend to let us come home.
We'll see.
Every being of the night, including she and you, are my adorable little children.
Well then, good day.
Toodles!
Don't you dare think of setting foot there, even if the queen allows it.
It's no place for a half-baked creature with a shell of flesh.
Those with shells bring only calamity.
I know.
I would never ask to be invited.
Elias?
You sure are harsh to everyone that isn't a fairy.
Damn shelled being...
Think of all the people and spirits that were lost because of him.
The humans were guilty back then.
It's always those of us in the humans' shadows that get the short end of the stick.
Well, then, why don't we bet on whether or not it'll work out between those two, Titania?
Far wiser to bet on the number of children.
True.
I'm finally out of the forest.
Fairy magic is such a pain.
Simon-san.
Chise-kun!
You're finally awake.
We were worried about you.
Sorry.
Shoot, the sisters are going to yell at me.
I'll be going now.
Too bad I can't stay for dinner.
Are you really my watchdog?
I'm kidding.
Well, then, Chise-kun, take care of yourself.
He's a good person.
He's just stupid.
He hasn't changed at all in ten years.
Ten years...
I wish you'd bought me ten years ago.
Even though we're going to be spending far more than ten years going forward?
I hope your experiment succeeds.
It will.
Will it?
We'll make it.
Now, Silver is waiting.
Let's go home.
What's this?
It's out of season, but it's a Christmas pudding.
She's aged it since the day you came home.
It's good.
Isabelle...
The girl and the mage set out to fulfill their final task.
The sorcerer Joseph's schemes are set in motion in pursuit of the masterless black dog.
Don't mess up next time.
