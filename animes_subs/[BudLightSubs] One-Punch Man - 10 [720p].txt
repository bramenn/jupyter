Long have I awaited this moment, human filth.
With the Subterranean and Deep Sea kings gone,
the Terror Lizard Clan can at last reclaim rulership of the Earth!
Now leading target towards point Bravo.
Roger.
We are inbound and on schedule.
We'll be on top of Bravo shortly.
UNPARALLELED PERIL
And who are you?
Hello? What is it?
What do you mean, come back?!
You're the one who said some weirdo monster was waking up
and flew me out here!
Weirdo...?
That's right. I was just about to start.
Listen well! I am the Ancient King.
As ruler of the dinosaurs Trouble? So what?
who once ruled this planet, It's not my problem.
I stand above all other lifeforms. Hey, shut it!
Can't you see I'm on the phone here?!
I'm so tired of this.
Who's he think he is, ordering people about?
Are you done?
What's with the chin? Trying to be scary?
Should I be intimidated?
Act brave while you still can, little runt.
Runt?! How dare you!
Ah, so you aren't helpless!
But if you intend to destroy me, a giant meteor is about the only way.
Fine. I'll do that then.
Don't make me laugh.
How about another 300,000,000 year nap?
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock.
It goes something like that.
Want to try?
You both look like quick learners.
I bet you'll get the hang of it in no time.
This is the cool thing you said you wanted to show us?
A sales pitch?
I'll pass. You do it, Genos.
No, I will pass too.
What I seek is not the art of self-defense,
but absolute destructive power.
You punks!
You dare mock our fighting style?!
I, Charanko, the top disciple,
challenge you
I give up!
Is he really your best?
Yeah...
I heard your dojo was full of skilled fighters.
Well, one of my disciples went wild.
He beat my most skilled students
so badly they're all out of commission.
The rest got scared and quit.
He's that strong? What's his name?
Garo...
He was my top disciple at the time,
but I gave him a good beating and expelled him.
You must pack a punch, old man.
Hey! This is the famed hero Silverfang!
Class S hero, rank 3.
He toys with opponents as he flows like water,
then delivers a blow like a raging river smashing huge rocks!
A master of martial arts!
You only became a hero recently, right?
You'll regret taking Master Bang lightly!
Enough, Charanko!
Do not disgrace us.
Saitama is many times stronger than me.
Master, you can't be serious...
Mr. Silverfang!
The Association sent me.
An emergency summons has been issued to all Class S heroes!
Please come to Association Headquarters.
Oh! Is that you, Mr. Genos?
Since all Class S heroes have been summoned, please come too.
Is it threat level Dragon?
Here we go...
Charanko, look after the dojo.
Be careful, Master!
If Class S is being summoned, they may need your help too, Master.
Will you come?
I willsince I got nothing to do.
HERO ASSOCIATION HQ
Oh ho, Silverfang!
It's been a while, Atomic Samurai.
I knew you'd come.
And this is the cyborg Genos and...
Hm? Who's this?
This is the Class B hero Saitama.
His exceptional talent will one day place him atop Class S, I'm sure,
so we asked him to come.
Hi, middle-aged hero dude!
Put'er there!
No handshakes. I acknowledge only the strong.
Once you've climbed up to Class S, I'll greet you properly.
Besides, I'm not middle-aged yet.
I'm only 37.
37 isn't middle-aged? I had no idea
Hey, who brought a Class B nobody along?
Don't you think it's beneath us?
And even if you were invited, a polite person would decline. The nerve!
I bet you're only here for some creepy reason
like getting close to us Class S heroes.
You disgust me. Leave.
What's with this sassy... lost child?
That is Tornado. Class S, rank 2.
That? I am not an object! She defeats monsters
with her psychic powers.
She is an ESPer.
Oh yeah...?
It appears everyone is here.
We should join them.
Hey...
Stop ignoring me!

CLASS B RANK 63 SAITAMA
Can I have some tea? CLASS B RANK 63 SAITAMA
My apologies for being late.
We do not know the whereabouts of Metal Knight or Blast,
nor can we reach them.
No sense waiting any longer,
so let's begin this emergency meeting.
You can call me Sitch.
I'm with the Association. I will be briefing you.
Let's get right down to brass tacks.
You heroes are here because you're the best of the best.
And now...
We're asking you to save the Earth!
However, even with your Class S skills, there is no guarantee of survival.
Walking away also takes courage.
Should you choose to do so now, you will retain Class S status.
But those who stay and hear me out will not be allowed to walk away.
You will be confined here until the incident is over
in order to avoid a general panic.
Are you all willing to hear this?
Whatever's going on,
it better be worth calling all of us here.
I skipped out on my little sister's piano recital for this.
If it's a load of crap,
I'm gonna tear this whole building apart.
Like you could do that with that skinny stick.
Yeah? How'bout I bust your head open instead?
If you think you can, go on and try, pillbug head!
Hurry up and get on with it.
Otherwise Mr. Pompadour here is going to die.
Hey, bobby pin, you siding with the girls?
The great seer, Madame Shibabawa, is dead!
Shibabawa? Was she killed?
No.
While looking into the future for the next six months,
she became agitated and had a coughing fit.
She popped a cough drop in her mouth
and ended up choking on it...
I get it!
So we have to figure out how to prevent disasters
without the help of predictions.
That's the focus of this meeting.
No. Madame Shibabawa has only been able to predict
a handful of disasters.
Excuse me!
Hey, you there.
Who's this Shibabawa? A hero?
You don't know?
She's a seer. A great one at that.
She correctly predicted earthquakes and monster attacks.
We've gotten through many crises without Madame Shibabawa's predictions.
But even so, we provided a bodyguard
and gave her special treatment.
Yes, because her few predictions were 100 accurate.
The crux of the problem, though,
is her last, greatest prophecy.
Even as she choked on that final cough drop,
she managed to leave this note.
It is a prophecy that will absolutely come to pass.
Here it is!
Can you read it?
Th-The earth... Th-The earth...
THE EARTH IS IN TROUBLE
What? That's so dumb.
Can I go? I have cram school.
I know you are a prodigy, Child Emperor,
but if you cannot grasp the danger, it reveals how immature you still are.
What'd you say?!
Listen up!
Madame Shibabawa's predictions are 100 accurate!
She has predicted many catastrophes in the past.
A few of them resulted in the loss of countless lives.
But not once did Madame Shibabawa use the word trouble.
Something more dangerous than a Dragon- level catastrophe or monster is on its way.
And it will occur
in the next six months!
Okay, but we've no idea when in the next six months.
Yeah, hard to plan for that.
You are correct.
But I want you all to be ready for a fight in the next six months.
In the next six months means...
it could be tomorrow, or even today.
That's true. Who are you, anyway?
Good thing I'm here.
The building is under attack!
That's impossible!
This is the Hero Association HQ!
A formidable fortress, to be sure!
Time to attack.
Hawk, Eagle, Falcon, Kite!
Yar! Yar!
Wipe out these so-called heroes and the land will belong to us!
We will dive straight in!
Follow me, the Sky King!
Father...above us...
Escape...
Me, the Sky King, killed like some worthless insect.
Who could have
What was that?
Who knows? It flew, so we killed it.
That is good.
Duty, to protect ship.
Emergency power activated.
What was that?
What's going on out there?
I don't know.
All communications have been cut off.
Damn it...
Impossible!
Dad!
We're okay now. Grab on to me.
That's the way.
Good job.
What is this?
There are survivors?
Ship, failed to kill all. Then we kill.
That is good.
Get away now!
You think I don't sense your thirst for blood?
I accompanied Master Atomic
and was waiting for the Class S meeting to end,
only to meet thunder and destruction.
Is this your doing?!
Destruction levels at 99.8?
City A has been destroyed in an instant!
Who could have known her prediction would come true this soon?!
Hey! Why was this building spared?
We assigned Metal Knight to construct this building.
That's why it's stronger than the average shelter.
So that's why there're no windows.
We should go outside and see. To be sure it's the prophecy.
Master! Will you
Master...
That's big! Are they aliens?
So that's what blew the city to pieces.
Go back to...
your planet!
A militant creature.
Also cautious.
Hurry. Let us hurry and kill.
That is good.
Can it be killed?
Each of its strikes is lethal!
I can't beat this thing...
Such a weak species.
Easily killed.
That is good.
It's splitting?
Damn, not now...
I will dispose of this. You handle the rest.
Very well.
I will go kill those that ran.
That is good.
Master!
Iairon, you okay?
You know, your left arm...
Master! Swords have no effect on this monster.
Forget me! Retreat!
Outta my way!
Iai! The path of the sword does not end for you yet!
Stop bleeding!
Yes, Master!
So there is a life-form on this planet that can fight.
Excellent!
Try to withstand our invasion!
Planet, eh? You from outer space?
And you got friends up in that floaty toy?
Yeah, that's it.
I doubt you alone have the power to do all this to the city.
Atomic Samurai, count us in.
You the bastard that smashed this town?!
And if I am?
For all the beautiful men you killed...
I claim vengeance!
Each separate attack must be delivered with intent...
Dark Angel
Flash!
Issue an evacuation warning to City A and all neighboring cities.
Right now!
And expand the System M vitals monitor to cover all of City A.
We need an accurate count of the survivors.
What's the threat level?
Dragon, without doubt.
No...
This might be God.
Four Class S heroes can take care of the enemy on the ground...
The problem is that.
We can't reach it.
Any aircraft would be shot down in seconds.
King, you're one of the top fighters in Class S.
Give us your take.
King, Class S rank 7.
Said to be the strongest man on Earth,
and I see he is well respected by the other heroes
There's nothing I can do.
It's too high in the sky. There's no way to attack it.
But the mysterious craft is currently dormant.
We should use this opportunity to call in Metal Knight.
What the?! That's pathetic!
Aren't you supposed to be the strongest man?
Hey, Tornado.
This city's been blown away, If you piss King off, he'll kill you.
and you're just going to give them a free hand?
Unbelievable!
Well forget it! I'll take care of this myself.
Wait, I will go too.
I do not know how effective I can be,
but I will attack from the ground.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I said forget about it!
Take it easy, Genos.
I understand how you feel, but if you piss her off, she'll kill you.
Very well...
There is no need to team up anyway.
Master has already boarded the enemy ship.
Whether this is the prophecy or not,
there's not a single evil Master cannot defeat.
If such an evil existed,
then I assume the human race would have perished long ago.
Well done making it this far, intruder!
But this is the end.
You see, there is no way you can defeat me, Groribas!
My Acid Breath will melt you away!
Isn't it about time the boss showed up?
Well, if he's alive...
I, Groribas, control this preview! THE DOMINATOR OF THE UNIVERSE
I perfected some new moves. Now I have like 20! THE DOMINATOR OF THE UNIVERSE
But I couldn't show them off,
because, you know, they killed me off first!
Episode 11, The Dominator of the Universe.
It's your fight now, Lord Boros!
