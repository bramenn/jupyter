Signs
Dark Flame
Crap!
I haven't played for a while, so I can hardly keep up.
Now I'm just a burden...
Hey, you're in my way.
Yuuta! Yuuta!
Yuuta! I need your support!
Seriously, what?
I've got a low level matter of high importance to discuss with you.
That makes no sense whatsoever.
I finished making a uniform for our Society.
A uniform?
Wear this during our operations.
You read it Dark Flame.
This is mine.
You read it Evil Eye.
So, from tomorrow's meeting onward
Dream on.
I told you I got rid of all that crap already.
Is that your character?
Yeah.
His name's Solitude.
It's just a game, all right?!
Hear that? The Priestess is home for you.
Regroup at 7AM, rendezvous point B.
Here we go...
It's July already, isn't it?
I get that I'm the only one who even sort of understands what's going on in your head,
but would it kill you to at least try speaking with others?
I talk with Dekomori, Kumin and Nibutani as well.
That's true, but how about some more people?
You only talk with me, Nibutani and Isshiki in class too.
We're the same.
We're not even close to being the same!
I don't like wasting time with pointless chatter, anyway.
What a pain.
Maybe I should just leave her be.
In this dimension, they are the only ones who acknowledge my existence.
Togashi, you're not half bad!
That picture of Takanashi looks really cute!
R-Really?
Let me see!
Wow, you're right!
Togashi, do you draw manga?
Not really...
I drew lots during my dark days...
I'm done. It's cool.
Really? Let me see!
Is this... Togashi?
In battle.
In battle?
Released on the verge of death, the mighty Dark Flame!
Shut up!
Dark Flame?
I shouldn't speak of it aloud, but the Dark Flame is Yuuta's most powerful sorcery.
With it, Yuuta becomes
What are they even do
Ouch...
Never let your guard down or you'll face death, fake Forest Summer!
Don't call me that!
Are you okay, Nibutani?
Ah, yeah...
Do you know her?
W-Well...
Even underclassmen love you, huh?
What are they even doing?
Yuuta.
Wh-What?!
We must talk after class.
What?! You got a love letter?
Now what?
Isn't this what you've been waiting for all this time?
What're you panicking about now?
I-I never thought I'd really get one...
Hey! You're not the moe character here!
But it must be because of the guitar, right?
Which means she appreciated my musicianship, right?
But I can hardly play at all yet! What should I do?!
You can start by getting off of me!
Everyone's staring at us.
I gotta play minors, right?
Chicks dig minor chords, right?
Where did you get that from? Calm down already!
How could I?!
Let's consider this rationally.
Question 1: Is it really a love letter?
I told you it is!
Question 2: Are you sure it's not just a prank by the guys?
Just look at this cute handwriting!
This Saturday after class, I'll be waiting under the ginkgo tree.
See?
Question 3: Could it be a girl and a boy in cahoots?
How can you distrust people so much?
That goes way back.
Who do you think it's from?
The letter's signed a classmate and there's no other name.
Do you have any ideas?
Well...
Hirataka, Nabatame, Tsumoji...
I got nothing. I can't imagine any of them doing this.
But if you consider everything...
Then?
Nibutani!
You know, every time our eyes meet she always smiles at me!
She's so serious and tidy too!
So she must be drawn to the wildness of a rocker...
No-no-no-no!
How do you know?!
There's no way it'd be her! That much I can guarantee!
What makes you so sure?!
C-Could it be that you and Nibutani...
Hmph! No way in hell!
Of course not. You two would never get along.
Like you have any idea.
Anyway, I wanna find out who sent me this love letter!
Even if I asked directly, they wouldn't tell me.
You're my only chance!
Can't you just look forward happily to the big day?
Are you nuts?!
Do you really think I could just interact normally right off the bat with a girl I just met?!
Ten to one I'll screw up out of anxiety!
Right?
How can you be so confident about your lack of confidence?!
The darkness swirls around me!
I can feel the powers of oblivion descend at my call!
I doubt they'd know anything about it.
When you wear this, you must introduce yourself properly.
Wielder of the Wicked Eye, Member Number Zero of the Society,
Takanashi Rikka!
Servant of the Wicked Eye, wielder of the Mjolnir Maul,
Member Number Nil of the Society, Dekomori Sanae!
Night Sister of Melodies, Member Number Nought of the Society,
Tsuyuri Kumin!
It is decided.
Deathly, that's right!
Why bother numbering yourselves then?
Zero is the coolest number.
I can't possibly imagine any other number!
I don't really get it, but I guess it's cool!
And now...
We shall decide who is most worthy of bearing the number zero!
That's death metal to my ears!
We can do this too!
I see!
Why do you play along with their games?
But come on, what are you wearing under your shirt?
N-No, I just... There wasn't any other...
Yuuta, you put it on!
Stop looking!
You stupid brat!
You came to meet your death?
I guess you lack the brains to understand anything but force.
Oh no! The white water!
I warmed it so that you can fully enjoy its taste and body.
Are you the devil incarnate?!
Oh wait, I'm a creature of darkness now...
Are you an angel incarnate?!
Not a single damn was given!
Drink it! Drink it all!
Stop! In the name of death, stop!
Hang in there, Deko!
Come on!
Deko!
Hey, Nibutani...
What? Can't you see I'm busy?! Shut up!
Um, the thing is...
What?! Get outta my face!
You want some too?!
H-Hey!
Oh, Isshiki! How's it going?
I just needed to talk to Yuuta for a sec...
Ah, I see! You caught me off guard there...
You almost got me there!
Your vile white water is no more!
Bear witness, fake Forest Summer, and despair as you face the limitless power of my Death Drive!
Forest Summer?
Don't ask me... She's kinda nuts.
Mabinogion's Rainbow Manuscript, Chapter Three, Verse One.
When the whispers of the spirits, and the dreams of light and water reach our hearts,
a world of ivory whiteness opens up to us.
I, who have been watching over this world for more than four centuries, alone understand.
That which this world needs most is...
Love!
Stop! Anything but that!
What's going on?!
You really are a mere fake.
The words of the true being devastate you mentally!
Forest Summer, are you
Don't call me that!
Um, Nibutani...
If you even think of telling anyone in class what you just saw...
I'll place a deadly curse upon you.
The wind... cometh...
Wh-What do you think?
Could it be a prank?
No, I'd say this really was written by a girl.
Really?!
Do you know who wrote it?
Not that much, no.
Do you think it could be love at first sight?
You seriously consider that a possibility?
Not a chance.
Nobody asked you!
Anyway, what you choose to do from now on will decide how all this goes.
And I hope you already forgot what you saw today. For your sake.
O-Of course.
That's great news!
See you later!
So, what now?
Well, I guess...
I'll do what it takes.
Between now and Saturday I'll simulate how it could go with all the girls in class,
so that I'll know what to do no matter who it is!
Seriously?!
You'll see!
I already got intel on all the girls from the guys during the cutie poll!
I still have enough time!
Isshiki...
But I must use that time well, so I'm taking this train!
Later!
What's wrong? We should get going.
Yuuta, your hand.
Huh? My hand?
Don't move.
What was that about?
I was reading the wind.
The wind?
Come on!
I felt a great disturbance in the air.
It was just the train!
So if what's written in this notebook found by Inomata is true,
then the boys of this class have arbitrarily ranked the girls.
This is bad. Could it get any worse?
Was it back then? By the bench at the station yesterday?
Most probably.
But they don't yet know whose it is.
But...
I want to ask the boys about this.
Mera...
Yes!
Do you participate in polls such as this?
Um... Well... Er...
I don...
You don...?
Rem
Rem?
I don't remember anything of the sort!
This is bad. This is really bad.
It's only a matter of time now until they find out I was behind it all.
And then my newfound love will be over before it began...
Think! I gotta think of something!
Um, shouldn't you ask Togashi?
Yeah! He's a class rep, after all!
Togashi, what do you say?
Um, I...
Did you know about this?
Um, well, that's...
Uh...
It was me.
I wrote the notes you found.
And I made the ranking!
Isshiki!
Isshiki, is this true?
Yes. But please don't misunderstand.
There was no kind of poll amongst the class.
I just wrote it by myself!
I'm sorry. It was a joke that went too far.
This has nothing to do with the other guys!
I did it! I alone, all by myself!
Is that really something he should be applauded for?
Don't think so.
So you did this all by yourself, Isshiki?
Yes. But I can't change the fact that it was found, nor the offense it caused.
At this point, I have no choice but to...
shave my head as an apology!
Isshiki, that's...
I am a man! Nothing less would do!
But shaving your head?!
Yeah, I don't think that's necessary...
No. That's how men set things right.
H-How was it?
My take all the blame and look cool plan.
Well...
Not to mention the bonds of brotherhood that were forged from me covering for you all!
But what about your hair?
Huh? You mean shaving my head?
Come on!
The point was just to show I was ready to go that far.
But you said that was how you'd set things right.
Yeah, but they won't really expect me to
We will.
Nibutani, when did you
Let me make this clear: the girls still doubt you.
Whatever you said, you can't seriously expect us to just believe it like that.
Not until you really set things right.
Me?
Of course. You said it yourself.
No way... No way!
I'll ask one last time: are you really okay with this?
No, I'm not! Of course I'm not!
I finally grew this mane after enduring a crew cut for three years in junior high!
How could anything about this be okay?!
Then tomorrow you'd better get down on your knees and beg them to spare your hair!
But then I'd be just a loser!
Nibutani's right. If I don't set this straight,
all the girls, including the sender of that love letter, will think I'm a loser!
Not to mention that if I change my mind,
they'll start to suspect you guys again too!
But still!
I organized the poll. I must take responsibility!
That's how men roll, right?!
Is that Japanese harakiri?
No!
It's something completely different!
Cut it out already!
You lot!
You're in the way! Get out!
This is the stronghold of our Society. I possess the right to
We'll be done in a moment!
Wait, we're deathly
My servant!
I-Is it sealed off?
Hey, Yuuta...
Hm?
Thanks a lot, bro.
I'm glad I talked to you on the first day.
My dad went bald when he turned 35, you see.
Judging from my genes, I barely have 20 years left to enjoy my hair.
I lost three years already thanks to that crew cut,
and now it's come to this again.
It's all so stupid.
Isshiki, I...
Why are you crying, Yuuta?
Hurry up and put an end to this ordeal!
With your own hands!
Isshiki!
What's up, girls?
It's been sealed.
It's been unsealed!
Are you done?
My servant!
Yeah, we're done.
But Isshiki's quite nervous now.
Please try and cheer him up somehow!
Okay.
Roger. I'll bestow some mana upon him.
I don't really get it, but sure, leave it to us!
Deathly so!
But first, I must warn you...
Whatever you do...
don't laugh.
Did you listen to a word I said?!
What are you doing?!
Isshiki!
Yes?
I wish to empower your courage.
Come here.
O powers of Oblivion gathered at this unholy occasion!
By my name, I order you to bless this man!
Hey, stop that!
But...
He's so full of magic!
And thus the case of the cutie poll was finally closed.
Don't laugh!
Don't you have an ounce of compassion?!
And on that fateful Saturday, betting on what little chance he still had,
he waited under the tree for the girl who sent the love letter...
Isshiki!
Isshiki was met with the madly devoted support of all the boys in class.
So the sender of the letter didn't show up in the end?
Nibutani, do you really have no idea who it could have been?
What could you do even if I did?
I guess.
But still, you gave up your precious locks to protect the other guys.
That kind of determination is actually pretty cool.
And I think there might be girls who think so.
Really?!
You nuts? Of course not!
Are you making fun of me?!
Sorry! I just couldn't help myself.
Please, Isshiki, let me touch it!
Wh-What the...
Summer vacation's right around the corner.
Hey, Yuuta, what do you say?
Dad can't make it home this year,
so it looks like we're going to Jakarta!
Sure, I'll think about it!
Yuuta... I have a request for you.
Come with Rikka on our summer vacation.
I need you.
Summer begins.
Let's look for a
sparkling daydream...
