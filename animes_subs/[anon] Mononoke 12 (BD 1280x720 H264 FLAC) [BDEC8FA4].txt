OP
ED
The blue moon illuminated
your wandering shadow.
I could never tell you all I wanted to say.
It was so very frustrating.
I think about your faked smile,
and forget all the hot tears we shed.
What do these empty husks,
those empty eyes of yours, reflect, my dear?
The transient quarter moon
hides in a rift in the clouds,
as darkness seeps up from the ground.
Tell me the truth, please.
Are you so despondent
that you still sit alone, sighing?
Without you, I just cant smile.
I walk this banal town,
feeling such intense emotions.
I know that if I could treasure them and live on,
I would need nothing else.
The summer flowers that bloomed in the sky
Come falling down, dancing in the wind.
I can barely recall the night sky
where they all came tumbling down,
so what I can still recall is all the more precious.

Youre terrible.
Show him. Show him.
Show him. Show him.
Show him.
This is
Show him.
Are the cats doing this?
Show him.
Stop!
Memories are tied to a single place.
Memory brings about Regret,
and it is through Regret that fates intertwine.
All is turned upside-down.
Its all your fault!
With Form, Truth and Regret, all can be revealed.
Will you show me
the reason for
your Regret?
Huh? What was that?
Mayor Fukuda is corrupt!
I have proof.
Lets hear what you have to say.
Moria-san?
Is this information reliable?
Of course!
I have it on good authority that the mayor is meeting with executives
from the railroad company on a regular basis.
Well, theres nothing illegal about that.
But dont you think it unlikely
Im sorry, Ichikawa, but were not a tabloid.
that theyre just making small talk?
Thats not enough information for a proper article.
I think youre just jealous!
Jealous of who?
Youre jealous of me, Moria-san.
Ridiculous!
Youre jealous that I got such a huge story.
Its not a story at all!
Theres nothing to be jealous about.
We cant publish it.
Looks like it was a mistake to send you into the field.
You bit off more than you could chew. Im putting you back on the advice column.
You cant!
Im not giving up on this!
Ill get to the bottom of this. Mark my words!
Dont get me wrong, Ichikawa.
I think youre a great
Whoo, yeah! Here it comes!
Whats this?
A woman peeping at me?
I wont
I wont let them beat me.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, indeed, I look forward to it.
I see.
Is this still not enough?
Just as I thought.
I knew you could do it.
Im sorry for being so hard on you.
Forgive me, Ichikawa.
Thats right! I knew she had it in her!
Thats why I was so hard on her!
When did it happen?
Last night.
And you developed the shots yourself?
Yes.
Where is the film?
In here.
Hey,
lets go out.
But
This is a huge scoop.
We cant let afford to let anyone know about this.
Not even one of our co-workers.
Heres the mayor with Touto Railways Board of Directors.
Here he is with Nohinbashi Construction.
They met at Kisshou Hotel in Kajima.
The mayor recently passed a city ordinance at the rail companys request.
I believe he received a considerable bribe in return.
Where does he bank?
The Ichii Bank.
The mayors uncle is its president.
I see.
This is more than enough information to move on.
This is front page material.
Have it on my desk tomorrow night. Well run it the next morning.
Its not much time, but can you make it?
You want me to write the whole article?
Of course!
You did all the work, so you should reap the benefits.
Thank you so much!
I misjudged you, Moria-san.
I was sure you thought of me as a weak, worthless woman,
and that only a man could become a real reporter.
I just thought that
You couldnt be more wrong!
Thank goodness!
Im finally a real newswoman.
Do you know where Hichiriki Zakas Konata Inn is?
Write it there.
To prevent any leaks?
Thats right.
We cant let anyone know about this article.
Ill put it on the page myself.
Understand?
Yes!
Yes, the very same.
Yes. Actually, I have a proposition for you.
No, its not very pleasant at all.
No reason to meet anywhere else, is there?
Ill come to you.
Her Regret is close.
Her Regret is close.
You promise to help me?
Please, Im begging you. I want to be famous!
I couldnt stand to rot away here the rest of my life!
Are you the man I spoke to?
I actually had fun last night, for once.
Hello, Konata Inn.
Youve got to be kidding me.
You have a telephone call.
All right.
Ah.
Working here,
Pitiful, isnt it?
I was so glad.
Im different from that loser.
Im a newswoman.
This is Ichikawa.
Huh?
Why is that?
Yes, I understand.
Its true!
People have asked me if I wanted to be a singer.
Aw, I remember that.
I wonder what happened.
Moria-san!
Youre sure you werent followed?
Yes.
Whats wrong, Moria-san?
Why do you look so afraid?
Were in danger.
Oh, poppycock.
Its not as though well be killed or anything.
I just went to see if she was all right!
Theres no hurry.
Wheres the article?
I have it with me.
Are you going to read it here?
Yes.
Whats wrong?
Nothing.
What are you doing?
I cant let this out.
Why not?
Just following orders.
Whose orders?
Masao!
Masao, are you up?
Moria-san, you cant do this!
You have no right to do this!
Ill tell our superiors!
No use. Ive already spoken to them.
Youre lying!
No, Im not.
You planned this from the beginning!
You were always going to steal my
Im sorry. I had to do it.
You coward! You snake!
You planned it from the beginning?
Ill talk her out of it.
How?
Ill tell the Chief Editor! Ill get you fired!
This could be quite a problem.
Well, its not really my concern.
At any rate, Ill leave it to you.
Damn you!
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!
You think Im jealous of you?
Dont make me laugh.
I wouldnt do this over such petty concerns.
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!
Youre a woman to the end, never able to catch on when it really counts.
I was watching her from a much higher position.
What do you mean?
You must not hesitate in executing this order.
You understand?
We cant have this turning into a scandal.
Youre working for Mayor Fukuda?
How dare you? How dare you?
Yes, you women are so blind.
How dare you?
You have no ability to read a situation.
Ill kill you!
You never wanted to print the article.
You never wanted to print the article.
Youll take orders from me now.
Ill have it printed somewhere else!
I still have the proof!
Ive fooled you!
Where is it?
Give it to me!
Ill never give it up!
This is the only time I really feel alive.
The people wont allow this!
Stop it! Stop it!
That old hag
I wish she would just die!
You really are a stupid woman.
I gave you fair warning.
You made me
Made me kill you?
Made me kill you?
So sorry.
Its nothing.
A woman reporter bit off more than she could chew, and committed suicide after having her dreams shattered.
It hurts. It hurts.
I cant move.
No! No, it cant be!
No!
Please, notice me!
Dont hit me! You have to notice me!
Ill never forgive you.
Ill never forgive you.
No!
Shes not even good enough for the back page.
I want to be an actress.
Heres your payment.
Yeah, this is a suicide. A suicide, Im sure.
Shut up!
Ill never forgive you.
Ill never forgive you.
Ayakashi reside in a host,
and humans reside in the physical plane.
A Mononoke is formed with an Ayakashi as its host,
and fed by the fates of men.
However, when a Mononoke comes into the human plane,
it must be killed.
it must be killed.
This is
a Ghost Cat.
I will cleanse this world.
I will cleanse this world.
I will cleanse this world.
The Mononoke must be killed.
Release.
A dream?
Id like to embark on the second stage as soon as possible.
Were safe?
Are we safe?
It was just a nightmare.
Thats unlike me.
Im sorry, Ichikawa.
I had no choice.
Ill never forgive you.
Men are born into this world,
Ayakashi simply come into being.
If birth and being are accompanied by Truth and Regret,
they gain a Form.
If they gain a Form, they become a Mononoke, which should not exist.
We cannot eradicate the Mononoke.
However, we can purify them, and put them to rest.
And so, there must be a sword, and hands in which it might rest.
My friends, let me ask you of your Truth and Regret.
So long as Mononoke roam this world
So long as Mononoke roam this world
Miss?
Im coming!
