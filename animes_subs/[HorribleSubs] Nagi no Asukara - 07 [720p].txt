Wood Shop
Wow, this is...
Right?
Doesn't it look awesome?
Ready, and...
We did it!
Episode Seven: The Ofunehiki Shakes
You guys did a great job.
It's all thanks to me and Miuna.
Really? You're actually saying that?
This really is amazing.
I'm touched.
Right?
We really worked hard.
It was a lot more fun than I thought it'd be.
All right.
This calls for some popsicles.
Huh?
I'll treat you guys!
Do you want Gori Gori-kun pops or Homebase Bars?
So cheap!
Er, Sensei, it's too cold for popsicles today.
We even canceled swimming today.
Right...
But sadly, they don't sell meat buns this time of year.
I want to do the Ofunehiki...
They said that in unison.
Hot damn!
Talk about close.
They've totally got the hots for each other.
Th-That's not true! It's not like that!
Now, now, trying to play it off.
I wonder how far they've gone.
Ow!
That hurt...
That hurt a lot more than I thought it would...
Well, we are going to do it in a sense...
No, I don't mean that...
But what you taught us in class that they used to do.
With the sea and the surface working together...
Couldn't we do that?
Hey, that sounds like a great idea!
Since we went through all the trouble, it'd be nice to see a real Ofunehiki.
But we wouldn't be able to do it without help from Shioshishio...
so it'd be a little hard.
But if we're going to do it, we want to do it right.
Right, guys?
Yeah, since we came this far.
Yeah.
I understand. I really do understand...
But because of the disagreements
Shioshishio village and the Oshiooshi fishery cooperative have,
they're saying there won't be one this year.
Let's do it!
We went through all this trouble making it...
Let's do it! A real Ofunehiki!
Hey, Hikari...
Hii-kun!
I'll do something about Shishio.
Tsumugu, you be the leader and do something about Oshiooshi.
Hikari...
You say that, but I think it'd be pretty hard...
I know, but...
I don't like doing things only halfway.
Even if it's hopeless, I want to at least try everything we can do to finish with no regrets.
All right, I'm in!
Me, too!
Tsumugu, you're in, right?
I don't mind.
Me too!
Sounds good to me.
Great... This is great!
This will be great!
Yeah!
This is indeed youth!
All right. I'll help out as well.
Let's all do our best!
Yeah!
That was great, Hii-kun!
Everyone's so great!
I'll make sure that the Ofunehiki happens.
Yeah!
The thing that you and Tsumugu wished for...
Association to Make the Ofunehiki a Reality
Please!
Let's make the Ofunehiki a reality again this year!
Please help us get enough signatures!
Please help us out!
Please help us out!
All right, we're not going to lose! Right, Miuna?
Let's make the Ofunehiki a reality this year!
R-Right...
Please help us out!
Please help us o
You're going to scare people off doing that!
Please help us out!
We're trying to do the Ofunehiki!
Th-The Ofunehiki...
Here!
Thank you!
Good work, keep it up!
Please help us out!
We are Hama Junior High's Association to Make the Ofunehiki a Reality.
Please help us out!
I heard they weren't going to do it this year.
As Hama Junior High's volunteers,
we plan on doing something even bigger than last year!
Can you middle schoolers manage it by yourselves?
Please sign!
We're serious about this.
Please help us out.
Guess I don't have a choice.
Thank you very much!
Hikari's sort of amazing.
Thank you!
Why is he so serious about this?
I think he probably wants to get rid of his frustrations so he's going all out.
To think that Hikari has such a competitive side...
Humans really are pretty deep.
Ma'am. Pardon me, Ma'am.
Do you have a moment?
W-Well, if it's just for a moment...
Talk about deep...
I need to try hard, too.
We're doing the Ofunehiki...
I don't think that really suits you.
Huh?
Is that really the point here?
I mean... everyone can only do what they can.
If you try hard at something you can't do, it only hurts in the end.
You're all really going at it.
Pretty impressive.
Dad!
Akari-san, thank you for talking to the manager for us.
Don't worry about it.
Not to mention Sayama-kun, the manager's son, is helping out, too.
And I'd like to see it, too...
A real Ofunehiki.
Then, could you display these in the store?
You got it! Leave it to me.
Give me some of those forms, too.
I'll get you some signatures.
Could I get some, too?
I'll hand them out to people I know.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I mean, having the people of the surface and sea hand in hand...
It sort of hits pretty close to home.
I want to do the Ofunehiki.
I'm going to make it happen.
I look forward to it.
It's not happening.
Why not?!
We got this many signatures!
You can at least talk to the fishing association!
It doesn't matter how many signatures you get.
Let's Do An Ofunehiki This Year!! Association to Make the Ofunehiki A Reality The Ofunehiki is one of our historical traditions!
It was Oshiooshi that said they wouldn't do it this year in the first place.
B-But...
Come on, Dad.
This is the first time Hikari's been so serious about asking you for something.
What kind of parent does it make you if you don't at least listen?
I saw them collecting signatures myself,
and they were working really hard.
The people on the surface won't listen.
There's no point in talking to them.
Dad!
I thought that the guys on the surface were all pigs at first, too...
That there's no point in talking to them.
And they thought of us as fish...
so we were even.
But I was wrong!
We're not fish, and they're not pigs!
We're all humans that can communicate with each other!
We're really serious about this!
It can be just once!
Please get everyone together and talk to them!
You're going to rely on me?
Then we don't need your help!
Just don't get in our way, then!
So everything went okay with the fishery cooperative?
It really wasn't that hard.
Right?
Even if people couldn't really talk about the Ofunehiki,
they seemed to be concerned about it.
And what about your end?
My stupid dad wouldn't listen,
but the Young Men Coalition heard me out.
If I mention that the people of the surface already agreed to it,
it'll work out somehow.
All right. It's finally show time, then!
We're gonna do the Ofunehiki!
Yeah!
All right, time for food!
Hopefully everything works out.
If we don't hurry up and eat, there won't be any time to play.
But they're all so stubborn...
Just watch. I'm going to make this happen.
Hikari's working really hard...
Yeah...
But Hii-kun's sort of... um...
Different, isn't he?
Different?
Oh, I mean Hii-kun is always trying really hard...
But um... this seems to be a different kind of trying hard...
Um...
I think...
He's trying to change.
Change?!
I don't want to change.
I want all of us to be together forever.
Ch-Change? That's not good!
We need to hurry and stop Hii-kun!
Stop him and rewind!
I don't think we can do that.
But...
Thanks, Manaka.
Chii-chan...
There are some things that change even if we don't want them to...
But once someone decides they're going to change and work really hard at it,
I don't think even the Sea God could stop them.
Wow, they did a great job on this.
That's pretty impressive.
Not bad at all.
I think we could actually use this.
Look at all the details.
To think that they were able to get Hikari's dad to come out, too...
I'm getting nervous.
Me too. I sort of want to go take a piss.
Then go already, jeez!
They even prepared offerings...
When we were kids, we made all of these little things too, didn't we, Sakishima?
Why'd you come?
You... really made all this?
Yeah.
The four of us and our friends from the surface all worked together.
I see... So that's why.
Ojoshi-sama's kimono's fold is backwards.
Huh?
What?!
What?!
Wh-What are we going to do, Chii-chan?!
We sewed it so the left would be in front!
Ojoshi-sama's going to die!
Wha Calm down!
We can fix that in no time.
Hikari...
Talk about a preemptive strike.
No worries!
We're just getting started.
It appears that everyone is ready now.
I'll be moderating the meeting today.
So, what do you all think?
The students worked really hard to make this.
So as their teacher, I'd really like to see their dream come true.
Well, we never objected to doing the Ofunehiki in the first place.
Yeah.
And festivals shouldn't be disregarded.
And it's not like we're going to neglect the god.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Sakishima.
The kids went so far to do this.
A lot's happened, but why don't we let it go?
Yeah.
Well, go ahead and start.
But it's already started...
Not that.
I'm saying that we'll listen to your apology now.
What?
Apology?
We came all the way here.
Apologize to your heart's content.
Our hearts are as wide as the sea.
It'll probably be a little rude, but we'll hear it out.
Why would we have to apologize?
You're the ones that said you wouldn't do the festival in the first place.
Hold on a second.
Are you trying to say you don't remember the last Ofunehiki?
You guys were complaining about how there wasn't enough money
or enough people, and you asked to scale things down, didn't you?
Not to mention this happened time after time...
At that rate,
even if we hadn't said we weren't going to do it,
Hey, this doesn't look very good, does it?
you guys would have said it yourselves.
That's not true!
Please wait!
This isn't a gathering to say who should apologize or who's at faul
Stay out of it, kid!
Anyway, you're the ones who called it off first.
It's only natural that you apologize.
Not to mention,
the reason we don't have enough people or any money
is because ya'll keep taking them from the top!
That's right!
Both our fish and our women!
What?
The reason your women run off is because you guys aren't reliable, isn't it?
You're gonna blame us for that, too?
What'd you just say?!
Looks like it's gonna rain...
You're going to come, too?
Yeah.
Hikari worked really hard...
Also,
I really want to show Miuna-chan an actual Ofunehiki.
Maybe it's because of our roots.
There's that, and if Miuna-chan is ever lost...
I thought it could be like a light in her heart.
Akari...
Thank you...
For thinking about Miuna.
All right, let's go in.
The hell are you saying, fish head?
Excuse u
Shut up, you pigs!
All your squealing's annoying!
All right then.
Why don't we settle things once and for all?
What'd you just say?!
Is this a bad time?
Whoa.
That sucks.
Itaru-san...
Talk about bad timing...
Hey! You're the guy Akari's seeing!
Um...
You thief!
Thie
We've got plenty of things we want to say to you!
Get over here!
Hey!
What's going on here? Hikari! Dad!
Would you guys stop already?!
You're adults, aren't you?
Why can't you talk things out?!
Stay out of the way!
Are you satisfied?
Looking for Part-Timers!
Break up with him.
As Hikari said, because we're not fish or pigs, we can understand each other...
But it's because we can communicate,
that we realize there are differences we can never get over.
People from the sea and people from the surface will never see eye to eye.
I always... thought something was different.
I finally realize what it was.
I'm talking about Itaru-san and myself.
And yet, you always change the subject to the sea and the surface.
I asked Mom a long time ago...
why she married you.
She said... the reason was simple.
She married you just because she loved you.
When I heard that, I was happy.
Because of that, I just happened to ask her,
what if you were from the surface.
And then Mom just smiled and said...
Even then, I would have been with your father.
I'm going to be Miuna-chan's mother.
Are you leaving?
Yeah...
I'm sorry, Hikari.
You don't need to apologize.
Because I'm leaving, too.
But
Being left alone with Dad...
I know that there's no way things will be normal.
All right.
I see, so she said she's going to leave.
Look.
The shaking's gotten more pronounced.
There isn't much more time.
What are you going to do, Tomoru?
Uroko-sama.
Are you leaving?
Yes.
Would you consider changing your mind?
I will not.
But you're still under my protection.
Thank you for everything that you've done for me.
But I've decided.
I will live life on the surface.
Thank you.
I'm not coming back, either.
Apparently everyone in the family is stubborn.
Good grief.
Akari!
Hikari!
Uroko-sama!
We must do everything we can.
Why not give up?
No good will come of you going up to the surface.
There will!
There's someone up there who's waiting for me!
Uroko-sama! Why are you trying to stop us?!
Because of a promise.
A promise?
I have to protect you both...
as you are his descendants.
Damn it!
You leave me no choice.
What?
The water temperature suddenly...
This isn't good...
At this rate, we'll freeze...
Like hell I'm going to give up!
I don't want to be... forced into the flow anymore.
Well, well, they're definitely giving it their all.
Uroko-sama!
Show some mercy... Please.
Akari, now!
R-Right!
Are you certain?
I want a shell from the sea that I love.
I don't want you to go through the same thing, Akari.
I don't care if I can't go back to the sea.
What's wrong with those two being together?
