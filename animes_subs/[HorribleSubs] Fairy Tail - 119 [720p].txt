Acnologia?
Did Zeref really say that?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't even move...
It doesn't matter now.
If Zeref really said Acnologia...
R-Retreat!
All troops, retreat!
The investigation of Tenroujima is over and done with!
Rattle, rattle... Kaboom!
What the...?! Stop that!
Since Laxus showed up and all... It fits the mood.
Can you cut that out since Lily is scared of thunder?
I'm not scared of it!
Crakabadaboom!!
Hey, I said stop that!
It's in honor of Natsu turning into a Thunder-Flame Dragon.
Is this really all we can do?
I know how important our mission is.
But I have a responsibility to protect my men.
In this situation, I have no choice but to retreat.
That's not what I mean.
Just leaving them there? When there are lives that could possibly be saved?
Don't be naive.
I was like that, once.
But when you compare it to maintaining the order and justice of the entire Magical World...
You call this justice?!
We're just running away!
You wish to argue with what I call justice and ideals, Dranbalt?
If that will satisfy you, then...
No, that's not it... I...
The Deepest Realm!
Slash!
Runes!
Your characters will be destroyed!
You think I lazily wrote runes just to protect my friends?
What?
I also wrote runes like this as well.
And I did it so you wouldn't notice.
Slash!
It looks like you don't know the character for to learn!
Runes! Your characters will be...
Your crappy roundabout runes seem infantile
before my single characters and their countless meanings!
Rumble
That is quite hard on the ears...
My runes?!
Slash
Rumble becomes resound!
In other words, the character means more than just sound, it means expanding!
So he uses characters to strengthen the effects of his characters...
I see. It's simple, but it has deep meaning.
But, you have not realized something.
The line that connects two points...
In other words, the things called words...
Roundabout...
What have they been going on about?
Theory vs. Theory.
That's what it looks like.
Isn't that arguing over pointless things?
He's out!
Baryon Formation!
Egg Wall!
Beautifully fried-peron!
What the heck?!
It's time to cook you next-peron!
Looks like he's having a rough time over there, too.
We've got to join in...
But the battle we just had used up all our magic power...
That's true!
We might be out of strength and magic power...
But that's food right over there!
Uh... Elf-niichan...
Rarin' to go, isn't he?
I'll pass.
Man!
Hey, you!
You've got to be...
Okay! Maybe it's only temporary, but...
He ate lightning?
The fusion of flame and lightning!
The Thunder-Flame Dragon...
It's the same as when he ate Etherion.
After hitting him with flames, he followed up with a lightning attack!
Amazing!
Egg Buster!
Why, you...!
Man!
Defense
Slash!
Don't push yourself, Elfman.
You can barely stand!
So what? Even if I don't have enough magic power for a full body Take-Over...
As long as I have this arm...
It might have hurt my little sister Lisanna, and made my older sister cry...
This helpless arm couldn't even protect my partner!
But Elfman, the Man, will put everything he's got into this arm as a Fairy Tail wizard and beat you!
Well said!
Three as one! You'll fill in for Ever's role!
Shut up with the Man, Man stuff-pero!
Meaningless words hold no power!
Ecriture of Darkness! Pain!
Hold up, my babies!
Why does it hurt so much-pero?!
I won't let you!
They did it!
Wow...
No, it's not over yet.
Your claws are dull!
All you need is yourself!
Pierce!
Not bad timing for an impromptu combination, Elfman...
Man!!
Did I just see something?!
You did it, Elf-niichan!
S-Scary...
Lucky we didn't draw him for the first test...
Looks like we managed to protect everyone.
I'm totally drained...
I think maybe now I'll rest a bit...
You hurt our guild, damn you!
You...
Disappear!
Now you can't use your hands!
Roar of the Thunder-Flame Dragon!
What is...
Is that Natsu?
Natsu... Stay alive.
We did... it...
Natsu!
P-Phew...
I'm really outta magic power now.
With such overwhelming magic power, it looks like he consumed it just as quickly.
It's over now, right?
Yes!
Where in the world is the power source?
With a ship this big, it should be powered by a huge lacrima.
And why are we crawling through this passage?
Don't ask me, ask Happy.
Just a hunch.
A hunch?!
Hey! Don't just stop all of a sudden.
Lily...
What?
You just bumped, didn't you?
If Carla bumped my butt, then that means you bumped...
Like I could help it!
It's your fault for stopping so suddenly!
You just bumped into Carla's butt with a *pomf*...
Lily, isn't that so?!
Are you actually complaining about that?!
Is this really the time?!
It's very important to me!
When we get back, we're having a duel!
Stop this!
Happy, more importantly... What caught your attention?
Oh, right.
What is this?
It's alive?
Such impressive youths...
Makarov, you bastard... You've raised some fearsome whippersnappers.
That's...
How many decades has it been since someone has beaten me like this?
You've gotta be kidding me!
It will be a trivial matter to clean up now,
but I must honor you properly for showing me an enjoyable time.
So, that attack didn't work?!
Devil's Eye... Open!
I'll show you all, special...
The depths of magic...
This is a realm which far surpasses even your imagination.
Impossible!
I've never felt magic power like this before!
It's still growing!
It is over, Fairy Tail!
Natsu!
Damn it!
I don't even have enough strength to move...
This is...
Doesn't look like a power source exactly...
Grimoire Heart... Devil's Heart.
Don't tell me...
I can hear voices inside!
No way! How did they get in the room?
We've been found!
I'll hold off the enemy! You two, stop that thing!
Stop it?
Let's do it!
What's with the tiny cat?
I'll stomp him flat!
Take this!
You bastard! You've done it now!
What is this guy?
Don't back off!
I'll borrow this.
M-My sword...
Stop it, sure... But how?
Looks like all we can do is try fiddling with stuff.
A sword that can change size?
That's like my sword, the Buster Ma'am.
Protect it at all costs!
If there's one thing we'll protect, it's this room!
I like it! I will make this my weapon!
Ah... My Musica Sword... That was expensive!
Now, come at me!
We can't do anything like this!
I hate pain!
Bring it on! I'll turn you into fish food!
The depths of magic...
What indescribable magic power!
Natsu, get yourself together! Please!
I can't move...
The farther along the path of magic you tread,
the deeper you sink toward the depths of darkness.
And what you find there in the depths, glistening...
Just a little farther... Just a little farther and I will reach the One Magic.
But that just a little is so very deep!
To fill that depth, the World of Great Magic is needed!
A world with Zeref!
Soon, the world will change with Zeref's awakening.
And, it will finally come into my hands...
The One Magic!
The One Magic?
I know that I've heard this somewhere before...
From Mom?
You all cannot go to the World of Great Magic.
You lack the conviction to dive into the depths!
What kind of pose is that?
From the Book of Zeref, Volume 4, Verse 20: Hidden Magic, Nemesis!
H-He made monsters from the rubble?!
With the magic power from the deepest depths,
you can even create devils from lumps of earth!
You can make the devils do your bidding, as heaven's judge...
That is Hidden Magic!
One after another... Every spell a bundle of magical despair!
This can't be!
I'm scared... I'm scared... I'm scared...
I'm... shaking in fear...
What am I afraid of?!
Damn it...
I'm scared! I can't...
Somebody, give us the courage!
Natsu...
What? I've got my friends this close by.
Fear is not evil...
It tells you what your weakness is.
And once you know your weakness, you can become stronger as well as kinder.
We know our weakness.
So, what'll we do next?
We'll get stronger!
We'll stand up and fight!
Maybe we can't help being scared alone.
But we're all right here, together.
We've got our friends close by!
Now, there's nothing to fear!
Because we're not alone!
Your vanity is praiseworthy.
But that ends now, as well.
As long as our friends are with us...
That's right, Natsu.
Even if we don't have any magic power left...
That's what it means to be Fairy Tail!
Here we go!
What can you do without any magic power left?
Dance, Dirt Devils!
Send everything to the pits of darkness!
Fairy Tail, your sun has set!
Natsu, it's the last spurt!
Yeah! I'll make'em pay for picking a fight with Fairy Tail!
Aye! And you have a plan for that, right?
Plan? I've got the same plan I always have!
Don't tell me...
Yeah! My plan is, of course, CHARGE!
Yeah, that's what I figured...
Next time: Dawn on Tenroujima
I'm all fired up!
'Cause I'm the Salamander, get it?
Way to kill the mood.
Ah, my bad.
