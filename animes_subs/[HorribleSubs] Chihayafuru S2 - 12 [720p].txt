Listen up, everyone.
I'm putting Chihaya in the number three position.
Huh?
In the regional final,
Hokuo went with even match-ups across the board.
Do we really want to dodge our opponents?
Chihaya, you just have to win.
Bring home the win!
Victory for Mizusawa!
Yeah!
But...
1. Yuube (Third-year) Class A 2. Hayasaka (Second-year) Class B 3. Ousaka (Third-year) Class A 4. Nanase (Third-year) Class B 5. Tanimura (Third-year) Class B
Akashi Girls might change up their order.
I didn't mention this...
I didn't mention this...
But...
They probably went with the same order every match
as preparation for the strong teams they'll face from here on.
They'll switch it up once they face a strong team.
So the question is whether Akashi thinks we're good enough.
I will begin reading the order for
Mizusawa High School versus First Akashi Girls' High School.
Mizusawa High School, Nishida-kun.
First Akashi Girls', Yuube-san.
Good, all according to plan!
Mizusawa High School, Oe-san.
First Akashi Girls', Hayasaka-san.
All according to plan!
Mizusawa High School, Ayase-san.
First Akashi Girls', Ousaka-san.
All according to plan!
Mizusawa High School, Mashima-kun.
First Akashi Girls', Nanase-san.
Mizusawa High School, Komano-kun.
First Akashi Girls', Tanimura-san.
It's so exactly according to our plan,
it's kind of sad...
Are they looking ahead to the finals?
They don't respect us?
Or perhaps...
they have absolute faith that their ace will win?
Chihaya Furu
The only sign of summer
Verse 12
Hold on, Megumu.
We're not playing Fujisaki.
Over here.
What?
Oh, sorry about that.
Swoon!
Oh, this is still the semifinal.
Megumu, how could you screw that up
after they read the order?
What? But...
They should just let us play the final now.
Swoon! Swoon! Swoon!
She really is ordinary and sharp-tongued, yet popular!
Megumu-tan is our bitter and sweet idol...
We first met her early last summer,
during the brilliant First Akashi Girls' cultural festival.
Wait, we're going to cut to your flashback now?!
We belong to the photography club at the neighboring boys' school...
What's this? Taking pictures without permission?
Get lost!
Teacher, there are perverts here!
Our intentions were pure,
yet they called us perverts for taking a few pictures.
That was when...
That's mean.
Would you like to take pictures of the demonstration our club's doing?
I'm from the competitive karuta club.
Megumu-tan was so kind and lovely that day.
Hey, hey.
How did the pictures turn out?
Let me see.
Oh...
Wow, very nice.
Delete all pictures?
Deleting...
No data
Feel free to come take more pictures.
I'll delete them when you're done.
Swoon!
Ever since, we've been taking pictures for Megumu-tan to delete.
What?!
What is it, Mori?
That picture!
It's from Megumu-tan's tournament last year!
You were able to salvage it?!
Bastard!
You've betrayed Megumu-tan!
We can't allow the chronicle of Megumu-tan, the next Queen,
to be completely erased.
Anyway, haven't you noticed?
Megumu-tan has changed...
Is that Ousaka Megumu?
Which one?
If she was the West representative, she must be strong.
She lost to a veteran in the challenger final,
but she may be the one who faces Wakamiya Shinobu
in the Queen match this year.
Is she really that strong?
That's amazing.
The one in glasses?
Which one is she?!
There. The one putting on a headband.
She must be fast, then.
I doubt she'll lose to anyone in her age group.
Sounds like she's strong.
Oh, but her opponent's really pretty.
When I watched Ousaka-san last fall,
she was more focused on adapting to her opponent than being fast.
I need to be careful and accurate.
Everybody helped to give me this chance.
Oh, that's right.
No matter how hard I worked, I couldn't have made it here alone.
This
Omi Jingu tatami is for five.
They should just let us play the final now.
You shouldn't say such a thing.
We will begin now.
Thank you for the game.
Thank you for the game.
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Creepy
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
The sound of birds crossing from Awaji Island
Megumu-tan is faster now.
She's way faster now than when she was in
last year's Queen match.
I got it.
Okay, one card at a time, guys.
Yes!
Akashi Girls' has this match in the bag.
Mizusawa placed second in the Tokyo regional,
and Group B didn't have any strong opponents.
Akashi Girls has them beat in both history and current lineup.
The match to watch is definitely
Creepy
Hokuo against Fujisaki.
The real final.
Wataya-kun, what was your objective today?
Huh?
I came here to cheer for my friends from Tokyo.
Then you're no longer allowed to do that.
So he's cheering for Hokuo...
Creepy
Last year, Mizusawa prevented us from making it to Nationals.
Amakasu and Takuma are the only ones with experience at Nationals.
This year, we were able to bring some first and second-years.
Fujisaki is fielding five third-years.
If we beat them here, they won't be a threat next year.
You can do this, everyone!
However, I'm...
Fujisaki High School Karuta Advisor Sakurazawa Midori (39)
The players from Akashi Girls' are playing well, Coach Minami.
Ousaka-san is a strong weapon.
Naturally, Coach Sakurazawa!
First Akashi Girls' Karuta Advisor Minami Daigoro
Everybody's in a groove!
I'm looking forward to an exciting final,
whether it's against Hokuo or Fujisaki!
Please keep it down.
Understood?
Yes.
When I watched Ousaka-san last fall, she didn't seem that fast,
but she attacked that card at full speed.
Being too aggressive with The sound of birds is risky.
Was she camping that card?
when I should have gone to sleep instead
She passed me the only A card on the field.
She'll be targeting it.
Here.
Oh...

Wait, why am I holding this?
awakens the guards of Suma Gate at night
While the autumn leaves of Mount Ogura would never...
Tough luck.
She shielded the While autumn on her right,
but While the autumn was read instead.
Couldn't have done anything about that one.
No need to worry.
It's still early.
I need my first card.
One card at a time...
I'm sending this card.
people would always ask if I was pining for someone
The only Since card on the field...
Heh, she plays a tougher game than her appearance lets on.
A night and Since I
are cards that Ayase likes to attack on the opponent's side.
Now that they're on her side, she'll feel like she has to protect them.
Okay.
One card at a time...
She'll feel like she's on the defensive.
The opposing team is made up of slender girls,
yet they look so strong.
They're moving in tandem.
Oh! Could it be?
Are the headbands the key?!
Next time, I should make headbands!
Your brother can easily win if he tries.
Hey, Tsukuba!
How can you fall asleep?!
Wake up!
But I played three matches in a row!
No ifs or buts!
You wouldn't understand how tough it is!
We're talking three to four serious matches in one day.
I'm a man and I'm about ready to fall asleep on my feet.
Oe-senpai...
This being her fourth match today,
Oe-senpai is the one most likely to be running low on stamina.
Especially since she lost her second
Lost by 2 cards
Lost by 2 cards
and third games by 2 cards each...
Lost by a lot
It really hurts when you fight hard, only to lose at the very end.
If you're gonna lose anyway, you might as well
let yourself be blown out so you can get some rest.
Blown out of all his games
Oe-senpai isn't the only one I'm worried about.
Komano-senpai's first game today comes in the semifinal.
Ayase-senpai is up against the opponent's ace
and just lost two cards in a row.
It's usually up to the ace to set the tone...

Inbox From: Mom Re: Re: Nationals That's our Bro! Good luck! Take a picture when you win!
I can always say that I jammed my finger.
Do I attack?
Defend?
Don't doubt myself.
Don't doubt myself.
Don't doubt myself.
Chihaya-chan, when in trouble, go lower right!
Always go to the lower right!
Make sure you check their names.
In Ousaka Megumu's case,
she's probably good at While it pains, While it may, While it brings, and Long,
the cards with the starting sounds of her name.
Me (Long)
Her best card is at her lower right.
I beseech them to wait for the Emperor's return before falling
Long last we meet, only for me to leave hurriedly,
She knew to pay extra attention to Long last we meet...
She couldn't get it.
No need to look.
Megumu-senpai would never lose Long.
My opponent's card in the lower right was read right when I set my eye on it.
This is the West representative.
No...
She's much faster than she was that day.
She has the potential to become Queen.
Hey,
that's mine.
You got mine, too.
Why are you holding three of the same card?
Huh?
Swoon!
Okay, one more card.
Yes!
There's a saying that boys grow up very fast,
but the same applies to girls.
You should all get serious about karuta!
The Kyoto tournament is in May!
Any application fees will be paid by the club!
You're such a pain, Daigoro!
Use your energy on the volleyball team.
The karuta club had plenty of history,
but it wasn't particularly strong.
Ousaka practiced all the time at her karuta society,
but she never tried very hard during club practice.
Everything changed after the Queen challenger final in October.
The West representative is Ousaka Megumu from
the Akashi Karuta Society!
She'd always had the talent, but this time she was also lucky.
That was great, Megumu!
Next up is the challenger final?!
If you win that, you get to play the Queen?!
Her classmates and friends...
Good luck, Megumu
It's too bad for Ousaka-san.
She made it this far on beginner's luck,
but that's not enough to face the Queen.
Yamamoto Yumi-san had more dedication and motivation.
Megumu, are you upset?
No, not really...
I definitely wasn't as good as she was.
We'll help you.
Huh?
We'll help, so let's practice until you're invested enough to get upset.
Let's make you Queen.
Everyone is working together to make Ousaka Megumu the Queen.
I tear up when I think
of how hard they've been working ever since.
And I'm a grown man!
She got used to all the attention
Ignoring...
she draws as the last West Representative.
This proves that circumstances can change a person!
The ace usually plays in the third position.
We'll put Megumu in the third position every match.
Our goal is to get Megumu more experience, not win!
Said night was young when the false rooster's crow,
I hadn't marked that one.
This is no good.
She's taken four cards in a row.
I need my first card.
My first card...
banish any lingering memories of the past
but the gates of Afusaka remained shut
When winds blow oak leaves in the twilight,
There!
I finally got a card.
This is just the beginning!
I can catch up!
Attack...
Attack...
Attack!
When winds blow, Chihaya-chan.
The rain...
When winds blow oak leaves in the twilight,
the only sign of summer is the ritual purification in the waters
Stopped...
This poem by Junii Ietaka
describes a comfortable last day of summer.
This day will define our entire summer.
Oe-senpai is leading by 4 cards!
She's probably tired! Exhausted, even!
That card is more than When wind blows...
More than three syllables...
Chihaya-chan, when this poem was written 800 years ago,
they must have felt very refreshed.
the only sign of summer is the ritual purification in the waters
They could
probably hear the wind blow.
Silent waves creep closer to the Suminoe shore, and when night falls,
Got it!
What?!
Megumu?!
Kana-chan,
I remember.
Speaking of dreams, there's Silent waves!
in my dreams, I creep closer to you
Megumu-chan...
Let's...
have a good match!
