Inferior Terran scum! Don't think that you'll get away with this!
The Kataphrakt that defeated Sir Vlad was orange in color, correct?
Every last Terran is the enemy!
Your Sky Carrier carried the Argyre. You saw it happen, correct?
That's right... He was killed by that devious orange bastard!
Only two Orbital Knights have been defeated
by Terran units, Sir Vlad and Sir Trillram.
Also...
According to this Sky Carrier's data, the ship that it was aboard
was on a south-southwesterly course.
I have no hard evidence. It may merely be a coincidence.
But right now, this is the only lead that I have to go on.
That battle on Tanegashima... My big brother fought in it, too.
He was killed in action. Murdered, rather. By you.
Magbaredge is the name of the family that adopted me.
My birth name was Humeray.
Your best friend was my brother.
Enemy unit overhead is in a nosedive!
Three others closing in from our flanks!
It's on a collision course with the bridge!
Direct hit! Last!
We won't make it...
Out of ammo?
Captain...
This is the end.
What was that?!
Huh? We're alive?
That's...
Damn him... How long is he going to continue making me look the fool?
I'm going out in the Tharsis. Prepare me a Sky Carrier!
Abide a moment, Count Cruhteo,
Milord Saazbaum, why do you stop me?
Did you not request that I capture him alive?
I do not wish him to notice your pursuit and alter his destination.
I wish to know where he intends to go.
Meaning?
Why do you think that he made use of the Audience Chamber?
If he is a spy, surely he has accomplices.
Worry not.
I shall track him from above.
Enemy reinforcements?
But it stopped the enemy attack.
There's infighting?
Who knows?
They might just be fighting over who gets to make the kill.
Either is fine.
Even if the enemy of my enemy isn't my friend, he might still be useful.
What clan does this interloper belong to?
This area has already been laid claim to by Femieanne!
I will not tolerate you taking liberties here!
Go, my messengers!
Botis' fingers!
He'll pay!
Lt. Marito!
Lt. Marito! Are you all right?!
Humeray!
Grab on, Humeray!
Marito...
Humeray!
I'll get you out of there, Humeray!
I can't land a shot!
They've put distance between us. Which means...
Control! Open the well dock!
It's Mustang 22!
Captain...
Kaizuka's brother, huh?
All right, fine.
Cover your ears!
Cover your ears, everyone!
Mommy!
What's that?
A hidden dock?
Engine status?
Still working!
Hull status?
Holding together, barely.
No, taking on water!
Make a break for the dock up ahead!
A-All ahead full!
H-Hey! Inaho?!
Mustang 11! We're going, too!
Nao, what do you think you're doing? Don't run off like that!
I could say the same to you, Yuki. Who's defending the ship?
Listen here, you...
Machine gun fire. Target: the rock above the gate!
But, ma'am!
Fire!
Guys...
What does that orange Kataphrakt have up its sleeve?
All right, now let's deal with that Ashura over there.
The Landing Castle will soon reach airspace where we can scan the Japanese archipelago.
As soon as we enter the detection area, scan for the Sky Carrier stolen by Slaine Troyard.
Princess Asseylum is alive.
I have seen her with my own two eyes.
Milord Saazbaum.
I have located the specified craft.
It is above Tanegashima in the southwestern Japanese archipelago.
It appears to be engaging Femieanne's Kataphrakt, Hellas.
What?!
Tanegashima, you say?
What is this place?
I've never heard anything about there being a base like this on Tanegashima.
But whatever it is, let's get everyone off the ship.
Lieutenant!
Are you okay?! Lt. Marito!
Don't push!
Try not to breathe in the smoke!
Evacuating the noncombatants has top priority!
Then the wounded! Leave no one behind!
Yes, sir!
Matsuribi-senpai!
Where's Mustang Platoon?
Inko and the others aren't on the deck!
They're still fighting out there.
They're using themselves as decoys to give us time to escape.
No way...!
Direct hit! Next, right 3 mil!
Roger.
To attack the assault ship, it has to break through all that rock.
To increase their impact, they have to increase their speed.
To accelerate using a rocket, you have to have distance.
If the distance is far enough,
throw off the angle just a little, and it'll miss its mark by a lot.
Enemy unit, 4 o'clock!
Heading this way!
That's not a problem.
That Martian attack craft will cover us.
You dare?!
What the hell is going on around here?!
Yuki. Let's attack the enemy Kat directly.
What are you saying?! We're no match for that thing!
I'm not so sure.
It might be all bark and no bite.
Inko. I need to borrow your handgun.
Okay!
Blocks 11 and 12, evacuation confirmed.
Evacuation of Block 8 is also complete.
So that's everyone.
Yes, ma'am. We should get going, too.
Any word from Mustang Platoon?
No, ma'am.
All we can do is pray, I suppose.
Captain Magbaredge!
Mizusaki? Why aren't you leading the refugees away?
I've had them take shelter in a cargo room up ahead for the time being.
The thing is...
Milady...
Is this my fault?
Did this happen... because I came to Earth?
Milady!
If I hadn't come, there would have been no assassination.
If there had been no assassination, this war never would have...
People would not have been made to suffer unjustly...
You're right.
Remember that. Because to these people, all Martians are the enemy.
How is that even possible?!
I haven't the slightest, ma'am.
What kind of installation is this?!
M-Milady!
Where are you going?!
This is... a Martian Kataphrakt!
How did it-
It's a crater.
There wasn't just one meteor that fell here.
One hit the shore and formed the bay.
And the other... ended up here.
Then this machine was-
Yeah. The demon we saw 15 years ago.
I always figured it had been annihilated in the damage of Heaven's Fall.
Talk about a touching reunion.
Are you telling me that we seized it?
Then does that mean that Lt. Marito's Tanegashima Report
was buried so they could keep this a secret?
But...
Capt. Magbaredge!
Look at that!
What in the world... is that?
Orange...
What are you doing, Nao?
The Ashura over there hasn't budged from that spot.
All it does is repeat the same attack.
I'm sure that they're its only weapons.
All I need now is...
Cover us.
Darn it, Nao!
Inaho!
Are you kidding me?
Opening contact channel.
I'll be quick. What are you armed with?
I have about 20 howitzer rounds. And you?
HE rounds, 9. Then I'm dry.
Don't do it, Nao! That's a Martian-
Sorry, Yuki. We'll talk later.
The Hellas' fists increase their hardness by becoming a single, giant molecule.
No bullet can destroy them.
No, one of the fists was destroyed.
Their molecular structure probably reverts when their fingers move.
Patch me into the signal from your stabilizers.
We use a different standard.
That's all right. I'll convert it.
Here it comes, Bat!
Bat?
I thought so.
Marax!
Why, you...!
Him and his crazy stunts...
We're moving up.
Is that a good idea?
It's okay. His crazy stunts tend to be the right move.
Pull them closer!
One left! Get directly behind it!
Their tails have no armor, which means their engines are also vulnerable.
Two more coming in from aft!
Course one-seven-five. Fly parallel to the coast.
Yuki, do you copy?
You only remember you have teammates when you need help!
Hold that course!
Botis... Marax...
Ronove... Halphas...
Raum... Vine...
How dare you harm my children?!
We'll attack it simultaneously.
Roger.
You leave me no choice, then!
It flew away!
Crap!
What is that?!
I don't know, either!
It's gained distance! It's accelerating this way!
Use your rifle to throw off its trajectory!
It's too big for a rifle!
I'm too heavy with you aboard! I can't dodge it!
I'm going to crush you like the bugs you are...
It's almost on us, Bat!
Keep quiet, Orange!
It dodged me?!
He stalled out to lose altitude?
It's back.
I can't pull out!
The same trick won't work on me twice!
It's all over.
What just happened?!
What...?
That's...
A flying ship?
No...
A battleship?
I've found you!
Princess Asseylum!
Impossible!
The Terrans have no Aldnoah! How could they have such a thing?!
Flying enemy craft closing in from 12 o'clock!
Collision course!
Filthy Terrans!
Brace for impact, everyone!
Damn you... I'm still-
All Martians... will pay for Father's death.
We did it!
Princess Asseylum, I've found you at last!
Your princess was dead.
And in spite of that...
You knew that the princess was alive. So why?
What do you mean?
Answer me.
Take me to Her Highness.
Answer my question first.
Wait... Are you intending to exploit her to your own ends?
If she's exploited,
do you have a problem with that?
Are you...
Are you my enemy?!
You...
are my enemy.
