The Stardia materials shop we'd been planning is finally opening!
Upsy-daisy.
W-Wow...
That looks like it weighs about 100 kilograms.
Lola's stronger than she looks.
Though she doesn't realize it.
What a lovely shop, Noir.
Indeed. There are many rare materials, so it'll probably be popular.
We came here today to help out with the shop, didn't we?
There's still plenty to do.
Luna, let go of me! Let go! Noir!
I cleaned up the back.
Thanks, Emma. That'll help out a lot.
Hey, is this for sale, too?
Yup. It's one of our shop's top items.
That's a sample, so you can all have a taste.
It's delicious!
What is this?
Sorry, that's a trade secret.
When I ate that golden slime back in the dungeon,
it turned out to be really tasty.
Hey, by the way, what's the name of the shop?
Well...
We talked it over as a family
and had trouble deciding right up to the last minute...

But we went with Tigerson's suggestion.
We figured it'd be better to have our name in it.
I finished handing out all the flyers!
Tigey's up front and ready to be our poster kitty, too.
Opening Soon
It's finally happening, Big Brother!
Yup.
Hey, it's time.
W-W-Well, should we do it? Should we count down?
Sure. You can start, Father.
Okay! Then...
Five!
Four!
Three!
Two!
One!
Stardian Rarities is officially open!
Wow.
This is rare.
I could probably use this to make medicine.
This gelatin is good, too.
S-So many customers...
It's all because you guys promoted the store so much.
Tigerson's doing a great job, too.
Open
Wow!
It's a lion!
It's so cool!
I'll play with you even more if you buy something inside.
Really?
Awesome!
Our lineup of merch isn't perfect yet, but we did everything we could for now.
Y-You're right.
We worked so hard.
This is all thanks to you, Noir.
I'm so proud to have you as a son.
Father...
I'm the son of a poor noble and lost my job to another noble,
but I was able to enroll at the Hero Academy,
and I even saved someone.
I made a new friend, too.
A famous noble thanked me...
And we were able to open up this shop,
all thanks to my master.
Hm?
Are you a peeping tom? You just snuck in here.
I guess you figured me out.
I can always tell when you're around, Noir.
You're impressive as ever, Master.
What's up? You look all serious.
I've come here today to express my determination.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm going to free you from those chains.
Huh?
I'll end this suffering for you.
Please allow me to properly thank you.
Noir...
Thank you for even saying that, but please, don't push yourself.
Don't worry. I'm a coward by nature.
Yeah, you're the type of guy that gathers all the info you can on the girl you like,
then lose her to another guy before you can confess
your feelings to her, and end up crying.
I'm not that bad!
Okay, sorry.
Yeah. I want to see Master smile.
Answer my query, Great Sage.
As you wish.
I want to save Olivia of the hidden dungeon.
How can I free her from the Death Chains without killing her?
I believe... the answer can be found on the 15th floor.
You believe?
Could you be more specific?
Ow!
The more difficult the question, the worse it gets for me.
Still... I have a clue now.
Hidden Dungeon 14th Floor
You will now undergo a trial. If you are alone, go to 1. If another is with you, go to 2.
I'm by myself, so I guess I have to go this way.
Th-This is, uh...
No skills allowed
M-Master did say not to push myself. It might be kinda pathetic, but...
I see. So the reason you became stronger
is because of the hidden dungeon and this Olivia person.
Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. I didn't want to put you in danger.
So you want to save her since she helped you out.
I'd totally expect that from you.
Y-You think so?
You're careful when it concerns yourself,
but if it's someone else, you can get pretty reckless.
But that's why you have me.
Emma...
I'll follow you to the ends of the earth!
We're the ultimate duo!
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hidden dungeon only I can enter!
Let me train in secret to become the strongest in the world!
That password just sounds like you expressing your life motto.
It does almost sound like something I'd say.
There's probably a monster in here.
Let's head in carefully.
It's locked.
S-Something's coming!
Foul giants! Throw down your weapons!
L-Let's just see how this goes.
Got it.
We're starving! Give us food!
O-Okay...
Here.
Whoa! What's that?!
This is my skill. I stored away some food in a different dimension.
These are called cookies.
I-It's so good!
What?
Give me a bite!
Gimme!
It's good!
It's good!
Disgusting...
Woman, do something funny.
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
Oink like a pig.
Hurry up and do it!
Okay...
Oink, oink...
Oink, oink...
Oink, oink, oink...
That's not funny at all.
Why are you even alive?
Hey! Give us more!
Yeah, sure. One sec.
My stomach!
Noir, what did you do?
I Got Creative, made the Poison skill, and Bestowed it to them.
Another result of the skills Master gave me.
I see. That's great!
You sure had a blast mocking me earlier.
O-Oink!
The next floor is the 15th, right?
Yeah.
There should be a hint there on how to save Master.
Wait, is this...
Master?!
Master?
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter.
S-So this is Olivia?
I-I'm not sure.
I mean, it looks just like her.
Master! Can you hear me?
We can usually talk using telepathy...
Death Chains: Olivia Clone Lv. 420
Skills Skills Skills
These are the real Death Chains?!
Wait, so this isn't her?
Apparently, it sent information from level 2 and created a copy of Master.
Free her without killing her and a path will appear
It looks like our only choice is to free her.
Leave this to me.
Wind Strike!
Hey, hey!
Are you the ones who freed me?
Thanks! I couldn't move on my own.
Stop acting like Master!
Huh? What are you talking about?
I know you're the Death Chains!
Aw, I guess you figured it out. I'm totally shocked.
If I defeat you, Master will be freed. Right?
Who knows?
But you know...
I wanted to see how powerful I was, too.
Noir!
If this recreation isn't complete, we have a chance.
Stone Bullet 40!
She's so strong!
I guess it's my turn now.
It's so hot!
That's Fire Dragon Strike! Be careful!
Take that!
I-It's so persistent!
I'm guessing you're about a Grade B on Dual-Wielded Daggers.
Not that you'll even be able to scratch me with those.
Emma!
Are you okay?!
I think so.
Okay, get a room, you two.
You're pissing me off.
O-Oh, no!
Aw, they ran away.
That's no fun.
Emma, are you okay?
I-I'm fine.
Hey, what the hell?!
You just show up outta nowhere ready to make out?
Master!
Noir, who's that girl? How could you, when you have me?
Emma, this one is the real Master!
O-Oh, I see.
They really do look alike.
Master, this is my precious childhood friend that I mentioned before.
See, we were just on the 15th floor...
I see. So the Death Chains made a copy of me.
Yes. She was incredibly powerful.
Olivia, this may be rude to ask you,
but do you have any weaknesses?
I figure if the fake is a copy of you, her weaknesses are likely the same.
Emma, was it?
What's your bra size?
Huh?
Yours are bigger than mine, huh?
So I won't tell you!
Sh-She's really your master?
Master, could you just tell us?
But I don't wanna...
I'm sure even you must have faced difficulties in some of your battles.
Maybe, maybe not. I think there were.
And I think it was when I was fighting in your town, Noir.
In my town?
Actually, why not just ignore that thing?
Huh?
I'm happy that you're fighting for me, but you should back down on this one.
Why are you so nice to me, Master?
Hm?
You gave me your very important set of skills, and you give me useful information.
I haven't actually done anything for you.
Well...
Coming down here into this dungeon and meeting you
has greatly changed my life.
If I hadn't met you, I wouldn't have been able to protect Emma.
So... I'm going to defeat that thing, no matter what.
I'm going to check Master's records tomorrow.
Then we should be able to determine the fake's weaknesses.
One of my parents' friends is a historian. I'll try talking to them.
Sure.
Thanks.
Opening Soon
This is definitely the best!
It'd look perfect on this wall right here!
Yeah, no.
And I don't think Noir would like your painting staring at him all day.
Noir and I have been destined for each other since our past lives.
I knew the moment we met!
Yeah, that's a lie.
Hey...
I just got back.
Noir!
What's the matter? You look exhausted.
Well, you see...
Oh! You must be low on LP!
In that case, leave it to us.
I don't mind taking it all off for you, Noir.
Maybe not right now...
I just had a great idea.
Whisper, whisper, whisper.
So I'll be in front and you can be in back, whisper, whisper, whisper.
I see.
U-Um, what are you...
Here!
This is Lola and Luna's special Pretty Girl Sandwich.
Don't you just want to gobble us up?
Olivia Servant.
An extremely powerful adventurer who uses mysterious skills against her enemies.
When she came to this land, she battled with the cleric Littorine,
and though the battle was fierce, Olivia won.
The cleric Littorine.
She possesses the Sacrifice skill and was able to torment Olivia Servant.
This must be it!
Sacrifice... That must be a pretty rare skill.
Sacrifice
By sacrificing skills learned, physical and magical abilities are
increased for a few minutes.hhh The higher the skill levels, the more powerful the user becomes.
Sacrificing learned skills to level up other abilities...
It doesn't enhance the other abilities for long,
and I'll probably have to do it on the spot.
But this is the only way to deal with the fake.
Noir Stardia
LP. 13700
LP. 3700
Get Creative and create the skill hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'd like to level up more before I face them again.
I-Is that...
It's Noir Stardia!
Wh-What are you doing here?!
My job is to eliminate any intruders that come to the 15th floor,
but I don't really care about that anymore.
She copied Master's personality, so she's too uninhibited.
That must be why she just followed her desires and came here.
So hey, why do you want to save your master, anyway?
Why wouldn't I?!
Being stuck there for 200 years is just too painful!
I want Master to be free!
Well, yeah. She's more than just bound there.
The pain's pretty intense, too.
I make her suffer excruciating pain regularly
and collect information from how she reacts.
B-But that's...
You mad? Aw, you're adorable!
Screw you!
I'll sacrifice Passive Defense, Blinding Light, and Night Vision to create...
Sacrifice!
I-Is this the effect of Sacrifice?
Wait, isn't that skill
I can do this!
You're mine!
Damn, you're fast!
Is that what you thought I'd say?
Huh? I felt Noir's consciousness just now...
That wasn't a fatal blow...
This isn't enough for me to... lose!
Wh-What... My body...
You need to use Discerning Eye!
I Got Creative and made it!
Wait...
Skills Skills Skills
Th-That sword... It has a lightning attribute?!
This is honestly a pain, so I'm going to end it now.
Noir...
Don't go dying on me.
I win!
Next time, A Battle I Can't Lose.
