The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Oh, yeah! Can you hear this voice?
Oh, yeah! It's hoarse from yelling.
Oh, yeah! Until your heart can hear it...
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
The moon and sun high-five.
Are you sure you're not forgetting something?
When you're not here to make me laugh,
even what I'm looking for can't be found.
Snowing, be honest with yourself and smile,
because when two people lay close, time overlaps.
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Don't say goodbye!
Last time on Fairy Tail!
Eisenwald is plotting something.
Shinigami Erigor, the Death God.
Some fly from a legal guild!
I know that flute! It's the flute of curse, Lullaby!
We're going to stop them!
The town of Clover, where the Guildmaster League is holding their regular meeting.
Makarov, deary, it sure must be nice to have all your little wizardies so pepped up!
The master of the Blue Pegasus guild, Bob.
FYI, a man.
Ooh, I heard that you gave some aristocrat a thrashing.
Oh, that was my new recruit, Lucy.
She's great!
What a boyoyoing figure she's got!
Stop it, you flirt!
Is this something to be laughing about, Makarov?
The master of the Quatro Cerberus guild, Goldmine.
Yeah, it's great they're energetic, but they go way overboard.
There are people on the council who're worried Fairy Tail's gonna crush an entire city one day, you know.
I'd like to be crushed...
Now that's not proper!
Don't go laying hands on your own little wizardies!
Master Makarov!
Master Makarov!
A letter from Ms. Mirajane.
Thanks.
Master, hard at work at your regular meeting, yes?
What do you think?
This here's our poster-girl!
Quite a looker, eh?
Oh, my...
Little Mirajane, huh?
She sure looks like she's grown up...
Actually, something wonderful happened while you were gone.
Amazingly, Natsu, Gray, and Erza formed a team!
I think this is the most powerful team in all of Fairy Tail.
I figured I should report this, so I wrote you a letter.
Talk to you later!
Oh, my...
It seems those worries might actually come to pass, oy...
What the heck?
Those guys might actually be able to destroy an entire city!
The regular meeting's over today, and I'm returning tomorrow, but...
Please let nothing happen until then, I'm begging you!
Fairies in the Wind!
Kunugi station.
This guy with a giant sickle barged on board all of a sudden!
I know them!
They're those bastards from the dark guild that hangs around this area!
I could understand getting on a cart or a boat, but a train?
Yup! What's the benefit of escaping on a train that can only run on rails?
It's fast, however.
Those guys from Eisenwald must be in a big hurry for some reason then, you think?
Why'd you strip?
Well, look at that...
But the army's already on the move...
Isn't it only a matter of time until they're caught?
That would be nice, if it happens.
A fly from Fairy Tail?
So you let him see the Lullaby flute and get away without saying a thing?
Yeah, Kageyama?
It's not like our plan is blown!
And even if he did notice, it's not like anyone could stop us now, right?
It is important that we take extra precautions.
We're going to put that plan into action.
So, at Oshibana station...
There's a forest the flies cannot be allowed to buzz around.
Teach them all a lesson!
Yeah!
Erza, you're going too fast!
Look, the SE plug is inflating!
If we let that flute be played, a great number of innocent people will be victims!
Just by hearing the sound, a person's life is stolen from them!
What are we supposed to do when we get there, and you don't have any magical power left?
If that happens then I'll fight with a stick if I have too!
And you two are here, as well!
I have a feeling I should say something to you, Lucy.
To me? What?
I forgot. I just know it had something to do with you, Lucy...
Gonna hurl...
That might be it!
As if!
Wait, Natsu! You'll fall out!
Let me off!
Hmm, what was it...
If it's not Lucy, gonna barf... then...
Lucy, weird...
Fish are yummy?
Healthy?
Weird... Weird... Weird...
Stop saying I'm weird already!
What's that?
Oshibana station.
Please stand back!
There has been a train derailment! We can't let you into the station!
A train derailed? Really?
I hear rumors that some dangerous guys are holed up in the train station.
Please stand back!
You! What's the situation inside?
Who the heck are you-
What's the situation inside?
What's the situation inside?
Guess she doesn't have use for people who don't answer promptly.
Understand what Erza's like, now?
Why'd you strip?
Eisenwald's inside!
Let's go!
Right.
Is this one my responsibility?
This one
Yes.
And then...
An army platoon stormed in, but it seems they haven't returned yet.
It's likely that they engaged Eisenwald in battle.
They've been wiped out!
They were up against an entire guild.
Every single one of them are wizards.
An army platoon hardly stood a chance.
I knew you'd come.
You Fairy Tail Flies!
Look at how many there are!
You fiend! So you're Erigor, I take it?
Natsu, wake up!
You've got work to do!
Not a chance. Trains, 4-wheelers, Lucys...
It's motion sickness times three!
So I'm transportation now?!
You damn flies!
It's your fault master Erigor got angry at me...
That voice...
What are you scoundrels after?
What do you plan to do with the Lullaby?
You don't know?
What's here at the train station?
He flew!
It's Wind Magic!
You plan on broadcasting the Lullaby?
I wonder how many thousands of onlookers are gathered around here?
And if you increase the volume, it'll reverberate throughout the city.
The melody of death, that is!
You plan on making innocent people listen to the flute's lullaby?
It's a purge.
I'm purging the fools who guard their own rights and safety
without even knowing there are those whose same rights have been stolen away.
Their sin is living without knowing that this world isn't just.
And so...
The Shinigami has come to punish them!
You're not going to get your rights back by doing something like this.
And weren't you thrown out of the league because you did a ton of bad stuff?
Now that we've come this far, we don't want rights anymore.
It's power!
Those with power can wipe the past clean, and can rule the future.
You're a complete idiot, aren't you?
Too bad for you, flies.
You won't get to see the new dark age because you're heading to the afterlife!
It's you!
So that voice was you.
He's back in the nick of time!
Oh? There's a bunch of'em!
Enemies, every last one of them!
This is gonna be fun.
You fell right into my trap, Fairy Tail.
Everything is going exactly as I planned.
There are some bastards that I must make sure hear this flute.
I've got to pay them back for what they did!
This is Fairy Tail's strongest team!
You'd better prepare yourself!
The rest is up to you!
Let them see how fearsome a dark guild really is!
He ran away!
Natsu, Gray...
You two head after him.
As long as you two work together, there's no way you'd lose, even to the death god Erigor.
Were you listening?!
Aye, sir!
They ran off!
They're trying to follow Erigor!
Leave them to me!
I, Rayure, will bring them down!
I'll go too!
I won't forgive that bastard!
After we clean up these guys, we're heading after them, too.
Two girls against this many?
Two girls? What do you think you can do?
We're gonna pluck off your wings, fly-babies!
But we're so cute... You wouldn't dare...
Lucy, come back!
Wretches!
A sword appeared!
A magic sword!
One more insult to Fairy Tail, and I can't guarantee you'll live to see tomorrow!
That ain't nothing we ain't seen before!
We gots plenty of our own magic swords!
Then how'bout some of this?
It turned into a spear!
It's a pair of swords this time!
This woman... She can requip so fast!
Requip?
Magic swords are similar to your Celestial magic, Lucy.
It works where you call out weapons that are stored in an alternate space.
Switching out which weapon you have is called Requipping.
Wow...
Erza's just getting warmed up.
Erza?
Okay, I can fight, too!
What? This was supposed to be Erza's highlight scene!
Gate of the Giant Crab, I open thee!
Cancer!
Cancer.
It's also a fight this time-ebi?
Cut this fight short, would you?
You with the freakish hairdo!
We'll get you good!
My weapon!
My hair!
It's almost like...
Kappa...
Kappa
You're cruel!
Nice cut-ebi.
Not bad.
Aw, it wasn't really...
All right, I made a good impression!
So that was your goal?
However, the way he ends his sentences intrigues me.
Digression
-Ebi? I just don't see it.
At least say -snip or something.
Not good enough?
Ebi-snip.
Anyway...
But there are still so many left.
This is a pain.
I'll wipe them out!
Ooh, her armor's coming off!
Magic Knights usually fight by requipping different weapons.
But Erza has increased her own abilities, and can fight while requipping different magic armor as well!
That's Erza's magic.
It's called: The Knight!
Dance, my blades!
Erza...
Could she be...
Circle Sword!
Whoa...
She wiped most of them out in a single blow!
Aye!
Damn you!
I'll take you on!
There's no mistaking her!
She's the most powerful woman in Fairy Tail...
The Fairy Queen, Titania Erza!
Wow!
I think I'm in love!
I'm not going up against that!
He might be heading towards Erigor.
Go after him.
Me?
I'm counting on you!
R-Right!
Off I go!
I must've driven that magic 4-wheeler too fast...
Everyone, the rest is up to you.
Work together?
You've got to be kidding me!
Fire and ice don't help each other!
No way!
And man, that Erza just does whatever she wants!
She decides everything herself, no questions asked!
I can handle this Erigor person perfectly fine by myself!
I can handle this Erigor person perfectly fine by myself!
Hey, don't copy me!
Hey, don't copy me!
Which way?
Perhaps we should split up.
Natsu, we're up against someone who's trying to let loose some seriously dangerous magic here.
If you find him, give him a thrashing!
And not only that, he picked a fight with Fairy Tail. What an idiot!
I'll burn him to a smoldering crisp!
Don't you die on me.
What?
Nothin'!
Wait... If he was planning on broadcasting the lullaby...
The broadcast booth.
Not here.
So then he isn't planning on broadcasting it?
I knew you'd come here trying to mess up our plan!
So what're you guys really planning to do?
Someone's come out!
What?
If you value your lives, get away from here immediately!
This station has been taken over by evil wizards!
And those wizards are attempting to perform magic that will kill every person here!
Evacuate as far away from here as you can!
Hey, you! Why'd you make everyone panic like that?
It's better than them all becoming victims, right?
You people should evacuate as well.
Now there are no longer people around the station.
What will you do now, Erigor?
What?
The station is being surrounded by wind?
No one can escape from my urumi!
Ice Make Shield!
Ice Magic, huh?
Ice Make Knuckle!
What're you bastards really after?
So you're not planning on playing the lullaby over the loud speakers?
Erigor's magic wind wall should be in place by now.
Magic wind wall?
A barrier of wind so that none of you idiots can escape from here!
I always did want to fight you once, Queen.
But alas...
I have no time to play with you now!
Erigor!
Don't even try.
This magic wind wall is one-way: you can only pass from outside to inside.
If you try to exit from the inside, the wind will cut you to shreds.
What in the world are you up to?
Thanks to you idiots I've wasted quite a lot of time.
If you'll excuse me...
Wait!
Damn that Erigor... Where could he be heading?
So he wasn't targeting this station after all?
I've had enough of your riddles.
Explain what's going on, now!
We just made a cage to trap you flies is all.
We were only taking over this station to block the route to the end of the line, Clover station.
What?
Clover station is across a giant gorge.
There's no way to get there except this route.
Unless you can fly like Erigor, that is!
So that's where you're going to use Lullaby?!
You know what's at Clover station?
Try and recall...
An opening!
Clover... That's the town where the old men are having their regular meeting!
Your true objectives are the guild masters?
So you've finally noticed?
A bit slow on the uptake, are we?
Those old men are extremely powerful wizards... Pretty bold of you, don't you think?
It'll be a piece of cake to make those unsuspecting codgers listen to the flute!
I know master Erigor will be able to do it!
And you pests won't stop us! You can't leave this station!
No one can stop us now!
We're going to get our revenge on those people who oppressed us!
We'll wipe them all out!
We'll stop you.
And we'll make you pay for targeting our master.
Those old men are like our parents!
Is it about time to spring the trap?
Erigor...
Where did that fat one go?
If you don't find him, Erza will throttle you!
We'll show you there're guilds way scarier than any dark guild.
Take me away to someplace!
Let's ride on a tin horse, just the two of us.
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
It's sad that my beloved doll can't talk to me...
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
Every time I think of you tears start to flow...
I'm a crybaby, aren't I?
In the moon (the moon) at night (at night)
I'm always (I'm always)
searching for the rabbit!
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
so much it's like I'm under a spell.
This love is a monologue
from which I'll never awaken.
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
since I've completely fallen in love.
I wonder what spell I could chant,
to get through to you?
The perfect thing to say.
Spouting this and that,
I just love you like crazy!
One day I want to be able to tell you
You got me.
My words of thanks.
There's nothing more to say!
Erza looked so cool in her armor!
It seems she's got over a hundred different types.
I wish I had cool armor like some heroic warrior of justice!
But you look better in other outfits, Lucy.
Huh, like what?
Next time: Flame and Wind.
Everyone likes that outfit the best.
Some uniform or something?
Right...
That maid out-
Give the maid jokes a rest already!
