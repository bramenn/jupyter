We've got trouble! Natsu's been trapped inside of an artificial dragon,
and is getting used as its power source!
Everyone wanted to try and rescue Natsu,
but Magnolia's facing a crisis, too! What should we do?
Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!
The real show's just getting started, ya'll!
Bust this thing up, and me along with it!
But if we do that, what'll happen to you, Natsu?
Stop making excuses!
If Magnolia gets ruined'cause of me,
I wouldn't be able to sleep at night!
Not budging a bit, huh?
At this rate...
What should we do, Erza?
Answer me, Erza!
Fairy Tail Wizards!
I heard a rumor while out on a job.
That someone was trying to make an artificial dragon...
That's how it started.
And you secretly met with this fool?
She said that she was gonna capture Natsu and use him as the dragon's power source.
And during the meeting, I heard it was indestructible,
but for a dragon slayer's power from the inside.
I see.
But if you hadn't handed Natsu over, that monstrosity wouldn't have been able to activate, yes?
No, that wasn't the only reason.
Unless Natsu defeats her, the people in that city won't...
People in that city?
That idiot went and forgot the promise he made to the people in the city without sound!
The guy just doesn't know when to quit.
Sometimes I'd go see how he was doing out on jobs.
But that idiot forgets everything else when he's thinking about Igneel!
but you must always remember your main role is that of a wizard of this guild.34; Yes?
I wasn't able to surpass Ul...
But him...
Natsu's the kind of guy who can surpass anything!
Even Igneel himself!
That's who Natsu is!
If he doesn't keep getting stronger...
Fighting him won't even be worth it!
Damn it...
I thought he'd be able to destroy it easily.
Let me out there, Gramps.
Understood.
I'm going to give you the plan.
What incredible power!
This power is exquisite!
It's the same...
I saw it... I definitely saw it...
So fearsome...
So ferocious...
I'd never seen anything so beautiful.
But dragons are free spirits...
Since I never knew when I might meet one again...
I'd just make one myself!
Argh! Screw you!
You ain't the only one that wants to see dragons!
So do I, and Wendy, and Gajeel!
But instead, you...
Dragons are gone.
They're extinct.
Just a hallucination.
Liar, liar, liar!
No one believed me.
They laughed at me, ignored me...
Beings of such power, dragons...
They kept denying they exist...
You must know how painful it is, yes?
Yes-yes!
And now I've finally been able to unveil this! To show everyone!
Wow, that's some messed up backstory.
That's the reason?
First I'll crush this city,
and then fly around the entire continent!
Gray!
Sheesh... I should have seen this coming...
I'll give you the outlines of what really happened.
You're free to believe me or not.
Crap! I've got to at least stay conscious!
Come on, resisting any more is futile, I'm telling you!
It ain't futile! Put some guts into it!
Who's that?
Don't you get what Daphne is saying?
No, I don't!
You forget about our promise?
Me?!
Only 6 left...
It's about time to start, I see.
Yes-yes-yes-yes!
H-He forgot?
A promise as important as that?
Honestly! I'd expect that of him, but still!
Thank goodness! Juvia believed in you, Gray-sama!
There wasn't any other method.
But right now, our first priority is doing something about that big thing!
Do something? Like what?
Someone's collapsed!
That's the owner of the cake shop!
He didn't evacuate fast enough!
Cover us!
We'll go save him!
Yes-yes! Lizardmen 3.1 show yourselves!
Crap! There ain't no end to'em!
What were you doing here?
My shop's been crushed...
But at least I saved this...
For this, you...
You were welcoming a newcomer, yes?
I'm not going to lose to a big thing like that.
I'll heal him.
Hey, Wendy! Your magic power still hasn't...
Don't worry, I rested a little.
I'm counting on you, Wendy.
Right.
You know...
I can't stand pickled plums.
Pickled plums?
Yes... They're like, my weakness.
Everyone has one.
A weakness, that is.
I've only just joined Fairy Tail.
I've only just started pretty much everything...
But I want to laugh more with Natsu, with everyone...
Cry with everyone, get mad with everyone...
I want to high-five Natsu-san once again!
Please, save Natsu-san...
Hey!
Wendy!
You fool! See what I said?
It's okay, she just lost consciousness.
But she's used up most of her magic power...
Only Natsu can defeat it.
But Master told us to attack the Dragonoid...
I see!
Erza, Gramps gave me a secret plan...
I figured as much.
You don't have to tell everyone.
The rest of you, eliminate the Lizardmen with everything you got!
I will take down the Dragonoid!
But, Erza...
What's gonna happen to Natsu?
This is the master's will, therefore it is Fairy Tail's will.
Got it? Protect this city, at all cost!
By the honor of our guild, our very soul!
Erza...
I know... I'm a Fairy Tail wizard too, after all...
But...
He-cat...
Juvia, come with me.
Heaven's Wheel!
Blumenblatt!
Yes-yes... Something that weak
is not a problem at all...
Where is it?
This thing's weak point... what is it?
Natsu...
I'm your friend... I have to save you, and yet...
Gray-sama?
Okay. This should be in that thing's blind spot.
The perfect place for a counterpunch.
What exactly are you...
Juvia, I need your help.
This is the crucial moment to decide whether Natsu lives, or not.
I can't imagine a Fairy Tail without Natsu!
That just ain't happening!
Gray-sama!
A Unison Raid.
Take this!
My magic power's about at its limit!
It's been bothering me for a while, but I'm sure now.
I've seen something like this before...
So loud!
Damn it! Destroy me!
Or wait, I'm gonna destroy everything!
No, I'm not!
It's acting odd...
This ain't good.
I can see it... That big thing's absorbing Natsu's soul!
Destroy me! I mean, I'll destroy!
I don't know anymore!
Natsu!
Out of my way!
See? Erza's all mad now.
Yeah, I know!
We'll crush her, too!
What are you sayin'? She's our friend.
Doesn't matter. Gonna crush her.
I said shut up!
Stop arguing inside my head!
My, my...
I'm not sure why we can hear the whole thing...
W-What'll we do?
Even now, he must still be affected by Nirvana...
We're done with that already!
We're gonna cover for Erza, and crush all the grunts at once!
But...
Ice and water... I felt it before when we faced each other,
but I think our magic power is very compatible.
Compatible?!
As long as you believe in me, I'm sure we can do it!
Will you lend me your power, Juvia?
Yes!
Magic Power Fusion!
Unison Raid!
What the hell is this?
A curtain of ice is...
The lizardmen are...
It's raining down icicles!
Whoa! That's cold!
I know the feeling of this magic power!
It's a Unison Raid of water and ice!
Do you think Gray and Juvia...
They dddit it!
Wow!
Thanks, Juvia.
Juvia is glad.
Gray-sama puts it all on the line for his friends...
That's one reason I've come to l... l...
Where'd Gray-sama go?!
Look at that! You gonna let him get away with stealing the juiciest scenes?!
Not bad, Gray.
We should just crush that guy!
Shut the hell up!
I'm gettin' so pissed right now!
Then why don't you crush this city, huh?
I said I can't, okay?
I think this is getting...
Can you hear me, Natsu?
Gray?!
You're completely helpless?
You should be ashamed!
You're nothing but talk, squinty eyes!
How long are you gonna stayed fused in that thing, doing your one-man stand up?
What'd you say?!
What's that for? That's cruel, Gray.
You forgot about the promise you made!
And you still call yourself a Fairy Tail wizard?!
Hurry up and destroy that dragon-thing!
Yes-yes... So that's what you were after, Gray Fullbuster?
But it's already too late.
Why? Because Salamander's magic power, and even most of his will itself, has been absorbed.
If I could destroy this, I would've done it by now!
Go crush that droopy eyes flat!
I'm disappointed in you, Natsu!
What?!
Isn't it so? Haven't you gotten through every challenge before by destroying stuff?
I don't wanna hear you say stuff like 34;Bust me up with it34;!
That's right! Everyone... Everyone in Fairy Tail needs you!
That's why we're trying so hard!
A Natsu that doesn't respond to the feelings of his friends isn't the Natsu I know!
Lucy... Why, you...
That's so mean!
Let's crush her!
Everyone's right!
You're sitting there, trapped! You've completely given up!
When did I give up, exactly?!
Seriously though, give up.
No way, damn it!
You said 34;bust me up34;, if I recall.
That's the same as giving up!
It's nothing more than weakness!
So, just as you wish, I shall rid the world of this giant thing!
This has gotten kind of weird.
Whoa there... Natsu's soul has mostly fused with the Dragonoid!
Just try it!
Yes-yes-yes...
The Lizardmen might be wiped out, but as long as I have this power...
Whoa!
Fairy Tail has no need for those who view their own life as insignificant!
Say that again.
I can't imagine a prideful dragon ever wanting to see someone as weak-willed as you!
When you'd leap to his breast to embrace him, he would smack you silly!
Give me a break!
With this power, couldn't we beat Erza?
Sounds like fun! Bring it, Erza!
Today, finally, I will beat you!
Man, what a simpleton.
I can hear it! He is pretty much saying exactly what he feels!
Yes!
We're doing impressions, now?!
Oh? Hey, don't move on your own!
You scared, Erza?
Someone like you...
Nope, she's scary after all!
It's not enough...
What, that all you got?
I ain't kiddin' around here!
Uh-oh!
The magic power being absorbed is exceeding capacity!
What happened all of a sudden?
All you guys think you can get away with pushin' my buttons?!
The flames of emotion.
Natsu!
Natsu-san...
Man, this is messed up.
I warned him and everything, you know.
Now the guy who's always hot under the collar has a body that's hot all over!
Gajeel!
Man, the dolt.
Gajeel?!
Stop makin' work for me!
Secret Dragon Slayer Art!
Karma Demon: Iron God Sword!
Gajeel...
Looks like I still got a ways to go.
I was tryin' to pulverize the entire thing and bust you up with it.
Oh, you...
Lucy! Call that horse guy!
Send all the fire ya got on an arrow in here!
Nice, Gajeel!
Leave it to me!
As it were, moshimoshi!
Can everyone hear me? Anyone who can use fire, lend a hand!
Okay, got it!
Oui!
We just need to send fire to Natsu, right?
Let's go, Al!
Yeah!
I can do it, too!
Thrust fire into that breast until he can eat no more!
We're counting on you, Sagittarius!
Moshimoshi!
Truce! I call truce!
It can't absorb any more magic power!
That stupid woman's insulted the pride and majesty of dragons.
Don't hold back. Crush her good.
Don't have to tell me twice.
Now! Fire!
All on one shot!
Moshimoshi!
Solid Script! Heat Spell!
Requip, Big Bazooka!
Guns Magic, Blast Bullet!
Oui!
Explosion!
Natsu, I'll pay back my debt!
Take it, Natsu!
Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up!
I'm fired up!
Anger! That, itself, is the source of his greatest power.
Master...
Freeing himself, and standing up to adversity...
It's the motivational power he needed to break through it.
The best way was to make Natsu angry.
Figures!
We all thought the same!
I told Gray to make Natsu angry.
And it looks like Erza figured it out without me saying anything.
Everyone, take a good look!
A Fairy Tail wizard is ridding this city of evil!
Okay, you dragon-crazed freak! You've really pissed me off now!
Go ahead, try and use one of those 34;Hidden34; techniques...
I'm gettin' more power all the time here...
More than you can hide from with your magic!
I finally... met one...
Apologize to Igneel!
For this impostor dragon!
Daphne's curse has been lifted!
Did he keep his promise?
That Fairy Tail wizard!
You see that, Igneel?
In the end, the weak point of the Dragonoid...
Seems like it!
Gray! You really did it this time!
It was your fault in the first place!
No matter how much we fight, no matter what happens,
all of us at Fairy Tail need each other.
We can't lose even one, you know?
Everyone is looking for someone,
and everyone responds to that.
And that's while I'll say it again: I love Fairy Tail!
Hey, Lucy...
What?
When you smile, don't people say you look like a sunfish?
What the heck?! No, nobody says that!
You sure?
Natsu, tomorrow's finally the annual cherry blossom viewing!
Right! But I need to finish up a request first.
I gotta get Wendy used to work quick, see.
Natsu, Gray, Erza...
I'm worried you guys are going to have a negative influence on Wendy.
Uh, can you put a little more trust in us, please?
Next time: Rainbow Sakura!
I think her choice of teachers was a fundamental mistake.
Then who'd be better?
Maybe... Freed?
