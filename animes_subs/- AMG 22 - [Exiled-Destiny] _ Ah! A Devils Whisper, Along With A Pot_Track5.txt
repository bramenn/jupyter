Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
You low-level demons... you're 1,000 years too early!
What the?
Curses! Where in tarnation can it be?
I didn't think they'd have a boss like that...
Could it be...
Aha, I've found it at last!
The legendary urn!
Soon I'll be rid of those obnoxious goddesses!
Ah! The Devil's Whisper Coming from an Urn?
O Urn of ancient times, Urn of Hakushon the Demon King!
I beg of you, grant my wish! I beg of you, open your eyes!
I'm going to unleash all the misery of the world on them!
Once the Lord of Terror awakens, we demons shall rule the world!
We'll have nothing to fear from those goddesses!
Hey, it's a kitty cat!
Huh?
Ugh...
The moment that the Urn opens its eyes...
Let the world know misery and despair!
What was that?
Urd, would you like some tea?
Uh-huh.
Hey Urd, your favorite show is on now.
Oh?
Urd, I tossed out those weird bottles of yours, they were in my way.
Really...
Oh...
Who knew there was a licensing system for goddesses?
Oh, come on, stop sulking, it's just a suspension!
Whoa!
Skuld!
Do you have a license, too?
Yes.
For example, I'm a Goddess 1st Class, 2nd Category, Unlimited License.
Class refers to precision and power level.
'2nd Category' is a commercial license.
And'limited' indicates what you're permitted to do.
I'm a Goddess 2nd Class, 1st Category, Limited License.
Urd's a Goddess 2nd Class, Administration, Limited License.
And since a license brings with it responsibility as well as privilege...
That's why you can get your license suspended just like that, if you lie all the time!
It's all my fault...I'm so sorry...
It's all right. A penalty's a penalty.
That's right, that's right! Learn your lesson once in a while!
Suspension, huh? I'd better watch out, too.
Listen, you guys, all this talk I've been hearing from you...
Watch out! She's going to explode!
This is all just a joke to you, isn't it? Summoning...
Huh?
That's right.
If she uses her powers during her suspension, they'll revoke her license.
So she does know that's the deal, huh?
That's it, I'm going to quit being a goddess!
Urd!
Maybe we were too hard on her.
Knowing Urd, I'm sure having her powers taken away must be stressing her out.
So how long are they suspending her license?
For this long.
Huh? Five months?
Five days? Five minutes?
Don't tell me Five years?
Fifty years in Earth terms...
Fifty years?
Isn't there some kind of course she can take to get her license back sooner?
Well, actually, there is, but...
Good!
It's a seminar in Heaven, lasting thirty years...
Thirty!
There's no way she can do that.
Really, who knew that walking was such a drag?
What's the matter? You don't look too happy...
Oh, well, I have a lot going on.
Hey, would you mind lending me that bike?
I don't mind, but you've got one, right?
What?
Don't tell me you don't know that you can't ride a motorcycle without a license.
License, license, license!
Another license?
Urd? Hey, wait! Stop that!
Calm down! Calm down!
Consideration for others, for other cars and for this town
So they'll give me a license here, right?
Well, it should be a cinch to get one for a moped.
All righty!
They said it costs money!
What did you expect? They said it costs money!
Lend me some!
That's something I can't help you with!
Oh, darn! All right, then! I'll get a part-time job, I'll do anything!
Open your eyes.
What? Who's that?
Man, that scared me. I thought she'd found us out!
Inoue Pharmacy
Inoue Pharmacy If there ever was a perfect job for me...
They said I have to have a pharmacist's license.
Well, of course you do!
Hair salon
Blowfish Restaurant Fugukichi
Sorry, I have an errand to run, so I'll be going now.
Gotta study for my license...
Hey, did you know you could get suspended if...
License? Suspended?
I sense you people are ready for a change, so please vote for me!
License...
Car in front! Stop, or your license will be suspended!
For crying out loud! License, license suspension, that's all I ever hear!
In that case, embrace my powers...
Who said that?
Oops.
Hey, you smushed my castle!
Look, I'm sorry...
Wow! That's amazing! Are you a magician, Big Sister?
Well, I used to be.
Just one more push!
Hey, what a coincidence!
Urd!
That was your power just now, right?
I'm sorry.
Just leave me alone.
I don't need a license here, see?
I'm going to live as a human being from now on!
Oh, man...
Will that be all?
The dessert special and a pineapple milk float.
And the sweet red bean soup and a mountain crepe.
Um, let me repeat your order.
One seafood macaroni gratin and one salmon and scallop spaghetti...
Lady, when are you gonna take my order?
I need an ashtray!
I'll be with you in a second!
I wonder if she's gonna be okay...
I just hope she doesn't push herself too hard.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, girlie. What are you gonna do about my clothes?
Hey, don't just stand there, you gotta speak up!
Shut up!
Huh?
Didn't you hear me?
Nope, didn't catch it.
Urd, don't...
Shut up...that's what I said!
The hell with licenses! The hell with my suspension!
I'm through with being a goddess or a human!
What difference does it make, I'm useless and nobody needs me!
Then assume your true form now!
Unleash your demonic powers!
What?
You are the Lord of Terror's rightful heir...
No, I'm Urd, Goddess 2nd Class, Administrative Category, Limited License...
Oh, even if you're unable to use your powers?
Why don't you shut up!
Accept me now...
Huh?
It must be tedious to have to submit to all these restrictions as a goddess.
Nothing suits you more than the freedom of a demon!
Act now, and I'll throw in a special servant, just for you!
Demon, did you say? Don't give me that nonsense!
Why do you have such hatred for demons?
When the purest demonic blood runs in your veins!
That's...that's not...
It goes against nature, for a Black- Winged being to be on the goddesses' side.
Think it over carefully...
We're not going to force you to do anything, you shall only do as you wish!
But I'm...
Now then, take a good look at yourself!
Now release the demonic power in you!
Urd!
Urd?
I've forgotten that name... what I used to be called!
But no! How can that be, Urd?
My name is the Lord of Terror!
What?
All of you people...know my true name!
I shall destroy everything in my path!
Wait!
Urd!
This can't be...
I can't believe Urd really turned out to be the Lord of Terror...
The Lord of Terror?
Yes...
The day before I received my commission as a 1st Class Goddess...
Belldandy, there is something I must tell you.
Yes?
A legend among goddesses and demons... you know of the Lord of Terror, do you not?
Yes.
When this Lord descends, the earth shall rupture, its axis shall be twisted...
Yes...
Urd...might very well be the Lord of Terror's heir.
What?
I have sealed her demonic blood, so I don't believe it will ever be unleashed.
But should the demons ever make a serious attempt to lure her...
If that side of her should ever manifest, you must notify me immediately.
Yes...
So Urd isn't really your older sister?
Urd and I were born to different mothers, you see, and Urd's mother is actually...
A demon, huh?
Even so...Urd is still our precious big sister!
Our beloved big sister, who shares half of our bloodline.
Of course she is...but...
He will send goddesses under his direct command, from the Combat Division.
Combat Division?
Yes. These goddesses are called Valkyries, and their duty is...
No way! Isn't there something we can do?
Do you remember when Marller was here before?
Huh? Yeah.
A catalyst is necessary for a demon to appear here on Earth.
That means that...
You mean there must be a CD or something!
Yes.
Either we destroy it, or use its counterpart to seal the demon...
Right!
However, once I've sealed her...
Oh...
That's no good... what are we supposed to do?
Whoa!
What in blue blazes happened?
So you've come at last.
Urd? What are you doing here?
Hmm, so it's you...the servant I was promised as a bonus.
You have no right to call me a servant, with that weird outfit on!
The way you're dressed isn't much different!
You shut up! Don't compare me with you!
Impossible! How can Urd be this powerful?
Behold, I am the Lord of Terror's rightful heir!
Know how powerful I am! I shall destroy everything in my path!
Lord of Terror? Ridiculous! How can a goddess like you...
Humph! I've quit being a goddess, it was too stupid.
I have discovered my true power!
Preposterous...how could Urd be...
But come to think of it, the legend did say...
Well, she always did have a demonic personality!
What are you muttering about?
My lord! What are you muttering about?
If you doubt me, would you like to experience my power firsthand?
Certainly not, my lord!
I'll get her to join with me, and make those wretched goddesses suffer!
With the power I have at my disposal, mere goddesses will be no match for me!
What...Yes, my lord!
Along with those annoying goddesses, we're going to destroy this world!
If I may be so bold... I have a strategy in mind.
Oh?
This is getting interesting!
So you're not going to notify the Almighty One?
No. If Urd has truly awakened as the Lord of Terror, the Almighty One will show...
Then, what should we do?
I'll get Urd to change her mind.
Belldandy...
Taking the burden on by yourself? You can't do that!
Skuld...
Even if she's become the Lord of Terror, nothing can change...
I'll go with you, Big Sister.
Come on, let's strike Urd down together!
What?
What good will striking her down do?
Oops... What good will striking her down do?
Anyway, if Urd hasn't lost her whole soul...
You have a point.
But the problem is... according to the legend...
Ultimate Destruction?
Program?
But Big Sister! If it's a program, then there's got to be a vaccine or something...
What's going on?
Banpei! What is that?
That's it! That's it! Behold my overwhelming power!
First off, I'm going to smash your goddess headquarters into oblivion!
Urd! Please stop!
Watch out!
Urd!
Is this what you wanted to do with your powers, Urd?
No, you're the one who always looks out for us. You'd never want to do that!
Show us how strong your soul is!
Please, Urd!
Belldandy! Skuld!
Don't pay any attention to them.
They're the ones who took away your powers!
But...
It's their fault that you got your license suspended!
Suspended...
Urd!
That's right! Demonic power...
Rules!
Is that what you call an attack against the Lord of Terror?
What the...there's no effect at all?
I can't have you underestimating my power, now!
Banpei! Deploy the Magnetic Net Wire Beam!
Fire!
Did you get her?
Skuld!
Banpei!
It's no good! She's too powerful!
Is this supposed to hurt me?
Keiichi!
This is my Powered Exoskeleton, Hercules 1!
Hey, this sounds kind of familiar...
That's because I used the engine from your bike as a power source.
Huh? What the heck?
You fools...
Give it all you've got, Beemer!
Oh no, I guess 45 horsepower wasn't enough after all...
You should have realized that sooner!
Keiichi! You should have realized that sooner!
OOOh...that tickles!
Whoa! The vibrations are loosening the bolts!
Bolts?
That's it! Belldandy!
I want you to remove all the bolts! Not just mine, but all of them!
All right!
Turn...fly... release yourself from your bonds...
I command you all to descend to earth!
What the...
Man, that was close!
Big Sister!
Belldandy!
You used up your powers, just as I anticipated.
This is the moment I've been waiting for!
So Urd and the giant robot were just decoys?
We couldn't have her doing you know what. Those were the Lord of Terror's instructions.
Sorry, but I'm going to seal you up now!
Belldandy!
Impossible!
Keiichi!
Damn...did you have to get in the way?
Big Sister!
Curses! I've got to seal her before she wakes up!
What the...
Dammit, Belldandy's come to!
I have no choice but to try again later. I can probably think of some use for him.
Marller, what are you going to do with Keiichi?
Who knows? You know what they say... only the devil knows!
Keiichi!
What's wrong? What happened here?
Keiichi's been captured by Marller.
But how?
When Marller was about to seal you away, he jumped in to protect you...
That's when she...
So Keiichi was taken in my place?
Yes.
Not only has Urd turned into the Lord of Terror, but if she's in league with Marller...
I'm removing my power limiter.
What?
Removing your power limiter is a huge offense!
If I'm going to stop Urd... and if I'm going to save Keiichi...
But...
I have to...I have to if I'm going to save Keiichi...
Almighty One...just this once, please forgive my willfulness...
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a wing!
I love you so much it hurts...
And it hurts me that I can't tell you how I feel.
You and I have matching hearts...
So we must share the same scars deep down inside.
But now that I'm in your arms, I think I can catch...
Nobody else matters... All we have to do is gaze at each other.
It's all right for your heart to flutter... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
Don't run away from happiness.
I'll always be waiting for you.
So come rest your wings anytime.
It's all right to cry... anytime you need to.
I just want to see you again... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
I just want you to be happy.
The Lord of Terror's fury is about to be unleashed!
Possessed by demons, the goddess unleashes the forbidden power.
