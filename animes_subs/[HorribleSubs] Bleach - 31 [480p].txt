Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
My love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
You seem to think
that you already know my strength just by fighting me once
Let me tell you something.
When the ranked Lieutenants and above are sent outside,
our powers are severely limited so that we dont adversely affect the human world.
My strength right now is five times greater than before.
So no matter how strong you become, theres no way you can defeat me!
So that means that attack there
was the best youve got?
Didnt even affect me! Not at all!
Thank you!
If 11 of these are what Im dealing with, I think I can handle it!
You idiot
Ichigo, you
Are you all right?
Yeah, this is nothing.
I-It's amazing. I can't believe it
That he can remain standing in his condition.
Damn My vision is getting blurry.
And my legs are shaky.
Quit shaking, dammit!
You talk big,
but it seems standing is about all you can do.
It's over!
If you didn't exist
If she didn't meet you
Rukia wouldn't have to go through all this!
Oh!
Get away, Ichigo!
I won't let you get away!
Ichigo!
It's impossible
It's impossible, after all.
Taking on a Lieutenant
Kirathis
It's Abarai's Lieutenant insignia.
He disappeared in the middle of the meeting.
I was worried, so I went to the Squad 6 barracks
and this is what I found in front of his room.
Are the Captains aware of this?
I haven't told them.
I see.
I thought about telling Captain Aizen,
but I didn't want Abarai getting punished because of that.
Until we know what's going on, that was wise of you.
Kira, what could this mean?
To remove this before he left
It must be very important.
Abarai's been mulling over the Kuchiki case a lot.
In any case, I'll look for him, too.
Stubborn bastard.
You want to save Rukia that badly?
Idiot!
Not want.” Will”!
Quit messing with me!
Rukia's crime became more serious
because you stole her powers!
Do you understand? It's YOUR fault!
It's your fault that Rukia will be killed!
I know that!
That's why I
will save her!
I finally see it.
His limit is three attacks.
Now listen up
For anything that can be called an attack,
the stronger the attack,
the more limitation will be put upon the number of the attacks.
Limitation?
Indeed.
Just like a gun can only be fired six times.
A missile only once.
Repetitive attacks are always limited to certain numbers.
Which means when he extends his Zabimaru is one.
And after that, he uses it extended twice.
And
After the third thrust
his Zabimaru will return to its original state.
Let's test it.
It doesn't have to be the same number each time.
What's crucial is the maximum number of attacks.
When a battle is intense
the enemy will always use the maximum number of attacks.
You bastard!
One!
If you can figure out what that maximum number is,
that will be your chance.
Two!
The most important thing is the last of his repeated attacks.
The moment before the repetitive attacks start again.
Three!
Damn!
At that moment, your enemy will be completely open.
This is the end, Renji!
I told you, you cannot defeat me!
He countered me!
Why?
You look shocked that I countered your attack.
Looking for an opening between thrusts is good.
And your timing was perfect.
So Why weren't you able to beat me?
There's one answer.
You are slower than me.
You can't overcome the difference in our power.
It's as simple as that.
Understand?
You cannot save Rukia.
Ichigo!
That terrific Spiritual Pressure just now
I hope Ichigo is all right.
Abarai's Spiritual Pressure
Huh?
This Spiritual Pressure is
Follow me!
I-Ichigo!
He's alive Ichigo is alive!
Damn right! He dodged the blow.
You are truly stubborn.
Why you!
You really tried to kill me just now!
Of course! Im now driving you to the corner.
I'll keep pushing you and pushing you.
So that you can use it anytime, anywhere.
This attack.
Don't be ridiculous! That was a fluke.
No way can I keep using it whenever I want.
You have to use it whenever you want.
Now listen, you have just begun to summon your true Zanpaku-to
and learn to fight.
You have potential.
But right now,
you're only at the level of a Third or Fourth Seat.
In order to stay even with a Lieutenant or higher,
you'll have to be able to use it at will.
Easier said than done
It took everything outta me then
and I don't remember much about when I did that.
I know that.
That's why.
That's why
Why you-!
Yes, I'll keep pushing you
so that you can remember that attack!
The target has hit the rocks.
Healing Squad dispatching!
Dammit! He's pitiful!
What's the matter, boss?
Not yet.
Dammit! At this rate, I'll really
I'm disappointed, Kurosaki.
I'm so disappointed.
Your sword exhibits only fear.
When you counter, it's because you fear being killed.
When you attack, you fear killing.
And when you try to protect someone, you fear letting them die.
Yes.
The only thing your sword speaks of, is dumb fear.
And that's not it.
What you need in battle is not fear. Nothing will come of that.
When you counter, you don't let them cut you.
If you protect someone, you don't let them die.
When you attack, you kill.
See? Can't you see?
The reflection on my sword is sheer resolve to kill you.
That'll do.
His Zanpaku-to
It's howling.
They're crying out.
They can't wait to cross swords.
See, you've got itresolve.
I-Ichigo
He intends to continue fighting?
But he's different.
He's totally different from before.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Renji.
Ive got resolve.
This time, I WILL get you!
What's with him?
All of a sudden Was it like that last time?
No, it's different.
That time, he was just exuding spiritual energy at random.
This time it's calmly controlled.
And without a doubt
it's much stronger.
When you counter, you don't let them cut you.
Why you-!
When you protect someone
you don't let them die.
When you attackyou kill!
Why you-!
He did it!
He got me
What was that just now?
Zabimaru
Damn it!
Ive got resolve.
Resolve
It hurts.
My body feels heavy.
My legs
won't move.
My arms
won't rise.
Damn it
Have I lost?
Damn
Dammit!
Rukia I
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll always stay close to you
Now and forever
Next time, Abarai's shocking past will be revealed.
A youth's bittersweet memories and a sentimental secret story!
Don't miss it!
Kira! Hinamori!
Don't give a preview that can cause misunderstandings!
Hey, that sounds like fun.
Don't you take it seriously either!
