Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
I'll take you to Hell!
Go to Hell!
Prepare to rock!
Juvia...
What's happened to you?
This is the ultimate vibe!
It's so loud!
Juvia... Is this because of the noise from that guitar?
Exactly!
Women who become my succubi can only hear my orders!
But if I captured both of you, the game would be boooring!
What I wanna see is a good cat fight between two girls!
You know, one of those rip-roarin', jiggly, slippery, hair-pullin' affairs!
You're just the lowest.
Lowest?
That's the highest praise you could give me!
It's time for little babies who don't understand rock to get spanked!
And I just changed clothes!
Now, then...
Which part should I devour first?
I think I should start with that dress! Too pretty for you!
Heart's Armor!
This is it, yes!
What are you doing? Get a hold of yourself, Juvia!
Juvia! You want to join Fairy Tail, right?
Attacking your allies isn't...
Hey you! Heyah! Feel the vibe!
Get her!
Water Cane!
Yes, raise the roof with that red rhythm!
That's the soul of rock!
Says who?
I want more cat-fight with claws!
Do it like she's trying to steal away a guy you like!
Guy I like?!
Love Rival!
I'm not!
It's no use...
She's completely under his control!
What should I do?
There's no way I could beat Juvia if she's fighting for real.
Die inside of Juvia!
I can't breathe...
Lucy-san... Lucy-san!
Juvia?
Lucy-san... Juvia isn't doing this.
Her heart is speaking to me?
Juvia doesn't want to hurt her friends.
Perhaps its presumptuous for me to say friend...
It's true that you are a rival in my love for Gray-sama, Lucy-san...
Although I'm not...
But, Juvia has come to love Fairy Tail.
It's welcoming, and fun, and a warm place...
Even in the rain, it feels like the sun is out inside Fairy Tail.
Juvia had no idea it was okay to smile this much inside a guild!
That's what I thought... And just when I felt I could finally become friends with everyone...
Juvia truly is a woman that brings misfortune...
Tears... Even inside the water, Juvia's tears are warm...
Juvia, baby!
It's about time to finish her off!
This will be the end for you!
People who shed tears for their friends...
Lucy-san...
Go ahead and boast!
Thanks to you, I remembered something pretty neat!
You're so boring.
Hurry up and destroy her, Juvia baby!
Okay!
I'll tear you to shreds with my Water Jigsaw!
Here's the big finish!
Lucy-san, dodge!
Gate of the Water Bearer, I open thee!
Aquarius!
What?!
She called a Spirit using Juvia's body?
As long as there's water, I can summon the most powerful Spirit, Aquarius!
It's all thanks to you, Juvia!
Shut up, you!
You bratty little girls!
Don't you listen?
I told you that my hair can absorb water, remember?
Juvia!
I'm over here!
Juvia!
Lucy!
What... is this magical power?
Those girls fused their magics together?
A Unison Raid!
What is this water?
This is more than I can absorb!
Sparking!
We did it!
Juvia is back to normal!
I'm glad... I'm so glad, Juvia.
Lucy-san, you're warm...
This might be the first time a woman has been nice to Juvia.
Hey, you! Don't go summoning me in freaky places!
You better not be plannin' on summoning me in a toilet bowl next, right?
I'll kill you, witch!
I'm sorry...
She's scary...
Don't get carried away.
Right, I'm sorry.
I'll be going on a vacation with my boyfriend for two weeks.
Do not summon me, got it?
Got it.
Get a boyfriend yourself already.
Hmph. As if that were possible.
No boyfriend
Leave me alone!
Unrequited
Lucy-san, love is very important.
Anyway...
We managed to get one of them!
Things aren't going the way Jellal planned.
No... It was you who defeated him, Lucy-san.
It was both of us.
You called me Lucy back then.
I was glad you did. It made us seem more like friends.
You don't have to add -san to my name anymore.
Since we're friends now, okay?
Huh?
Rain is falling from Juvia's eyes...
You have a funny way of saying things.
Let's wait a little while we recover our strength.
Yes... Juvia will as well.
A Unison Raid?
The thing that monk spent his entire life studying in pursuit of?
I heard in the end he never attained it.
Even if it's coincidence, that's quite the nerve they have.
They may be little girls, but they are Erza's comrades, yes?
4 people for, 5 people against.
As it stands we will resolve to hold off using Etherion.
Wait!
Do you people really comprehend the situation we are in?
Don't make a scene, Sieg...
You've already had your say!
There are still peaceful ways of solving this.
Peaceful?
While we're wasting time doing this pointless farce,
Jellal is resurrecting the dead!
Can't you feel it?
The overflowing negative magical power...
That's the horror of who he is trying to resurrect!
What?
Siegrain, what exactly are you...
I held back this information on the slight chance that it would leak out and cause panic.
But I have no choice...
What are you talking about?
Tell us everything!
The Black Wizard Zeref!
Is that the truth?
Sieg!
It's the truth.
I understand Jellal better than anyone.
Because he's my twin brother, after all.
We will vote once again.
Hoo-hoot Kick!
Talons of the Fire Dragon!
You thought that would work?
He's a match for Natsu! That owl's good!
Of course.
He's one of Trinity Raven.
I'm about to to drop the iron hammer of justice upon you!
Missile Hoo-hoo-hoot!
And? Think that'd hit me?
Now, rise!
Arm hands!
Around the World!
His techniques are nonsensical, but fearsome.
No, way...
I know your weakness, Salamander!
This is bad! That's transportation!
What?
Natsu can't handle transportation!
Going in for the kill when your opponent is weakened!
That is hunting!
Now! Capture Hoo-hoo-hoot!
What the hell are you doing?
Erza...
Do it again!
Why am I supposed to be super lucky today?
The result will be the same every time.
And wait, why wouldn't you be happy with that?
Super lucky my butt!
This morning I got stuck in a ditch, lost my wallet...
Nothin' good has happened.
Who's the kid?
Here comes another weirdo, sheesh.
This is the place Grandpa Rob talked about.
What the...
Gray!
What's going on?
He's being eaten whole?
I digest the magical power of people I feed on!
Give back Natsu!
Fire Hoo-hoo-hoot!
That's...
Happy!
He's digesting Salamander's magical power and taking it for himself?
How do you like that?!
This is the skill of the Assassin's Guild!
The final blow!
Sheesh... That's some crazy-hot fire there.
Gray...
A new challenger appears!
Hey, weren't you supposed to go after Sho and Erza?
He's held us up!
We need to find them quick or we're in trouble!
Jellal said that he was planning on using Erza as a human sacrifice.
I don't think there's anyone who can beat Erza when she's serious,
but she's too defenseless while she's trapped inside that card!
It was a mistake to tell Sho everything all at once.
But I never thought he'd go crazy like that.
Gray...
Save Natsu!
I always gotta save your butt...
What are we supposed to do if you get yourself eaten, huh?
You flaming piece of...
Digestion has begun!
In about 10 minutes Salamander's body with be dissolved!
And when that happens, his magical powers will be all mine!
I'll finish this up.
Don't be so cocky!
Ice Make Lance!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Dodge it! He has the same magic as Salamander!
You can't use ice within fire!
Gray!
Not possible!
If you are Salamander's friend, than you should know how powerful these flames are!
She's always by herself, isn't she?
Why don't you go talk to her, Cana?
She totally ignored me.
Well, I don't like it when a newcomer doesn't introduce herself to me, the great Gray!
Since when did you start being such hot stuff?
Hey, you!
What are you doing?
This is a wizard's guild.
It ain't a place to be wearing armor!
Then how about you wear something yourself, knave?
Is this a guild for perverts?
She sure told you!
Got to give her that one, Gray.
Why, you...
Do not concern yourself with me.
The flames are freezing!
You call these Natsu's flames?
Don't make me laugh.
You're nothing but a damn poser!
That's some impressive magical power you've got.
I'll capture you as well!
Gray!
Huh?
Ack, that's cold!
We don't have time to be wasting here!
We have to catch up to Erza!
Did you get beat up by Erza again, Gray?
You don't give up, do you?
Could it be you're in love?
Oh, shut up!
She's pretty amazing being able to get Gray like that.
Looks like the future of Fairy Tail will ride on the back of Erza the Great.
I refuse to accept her as one of us!
I'm going to bring Erza back!
I've found you, Erza.
Erza, it's on!
Today, I'm finally going to beat you!
It's you?
Sheesh, you never learn, do you?
Fine. Have at me.
Uh... Well...
What? You surrender already?
Why are you always by yourself?
I like being by myself.
I feel uncomfortable around other people.
Then...
Then why are you crying all by yourself?
You won't have at me today?
It's my choice!
Here I come!
Punch!
Outta my way!
Ice Blade!
Seven Slice Dance!
He did it!
She was always...
Natsu!
W-Wow...
Erza must be in Fairy Tail!
So she no longer sheds those tears!
8 people in agreement, 1 against.
Therefore, Etherion is given permission to fire upon the Tower of Heaven.
We have a decision from the Council!
Etherion will fire in one hour!
Start the preparations! Hurry!
What is it?
Pardon me.
Elder Yajima...
Sieg... Are you really sure about this?
If you think about it carefully once again,
there might yet be another way.
You may not agree with our methods,
but we cannot allow Zeref to be resurrected.
You know this, right, Elder Yajima?
I don't know anymore.
You will take full responsibility! Right, Sieg?
Of course. All responsibility lies with me.
What I meant is that you will be responsible for the lives you will take!
You are trying to send your own twin brother to oblivion!
You will have to carry that loss of life on your back for the rest of your life, Sieg!
I will bear it.
I will bear the weight of Jellal's life.
So, what will you do? There's no time.
Soon the light will rain down.
Hey, what happened to the bird brain?
Gray beat him while you were unconscious.
What? Damn that underpants man!
How dare he steal all the good parts!
Let's fight again!
Natsu, we don't have time for that!
Next time: Destiny!
A-Anyway, beating Jellal would be way more impressive!
You think?
Okay, let's go Happy!
I'm worn out...
