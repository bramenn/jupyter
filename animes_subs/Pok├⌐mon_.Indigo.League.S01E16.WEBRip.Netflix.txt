Holy Titanic!
Just as a Pokemon pirating plan is prevented by Ash and his friends,
catastrophe strikes the St. Anne.
The cruise ship capsizes with them trapped on board.
Team Rocket also faces the same horrible fate,
as the once proud St. Anne plunges deeper and deeper into the depths of the sea.
Could this be how it ends?
Pokemon Shipwreck
At first, we thought all the passengers had gotten safely off the ship,
but we have just discovered that five people are missing,
Ash, Misty, Brock, Jessie and James.
It makes all of us sad to think that these young Pokemon trainers
have had their promising careers cut tragically short.
May these flowers honor your memory.
A salute.
Hey, Ash. Answer me.
Wake up, Ash. Wake up.
Pika-pi!
What?
Hey, are you feeling okay, Ash?
-Pikachu? -What?
Oh, brother. What are you talking about, am I feeling okay?
You guys are the ones who are upside down.
You're definitely the one upside down.
Huh?
-Whoa! -Look out!
-Pika. Pikachu. -
Will someone tell me what in the world happened?
Just take a look out the window.
Huh? Huh? Fish swimming?
This can't be.
But that must mean
that this ship has sunk.
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love,
to extend our reach to the stars above.
-Ah, Jessie. -James with a perfect tan.
There's nothing like a tropical vacation.
-The blue sea. -The white sand.
-And the blazing sun above. -Ah! The sun.
Yes, that blazing sun,
fiery and burning,
and burning, burning.
Burning.
Something's really burning!
-You picked a bad place for a nap! -Huh?
Why is everything upside down?
The ship capsized and sank while you two were sleeping.
-What? -Aah!
We've got to abandon ship immediately!
I'm afraid it won't be so easy to get off while the ship's underwater.
The ship's sunk! We're doomed!
Calm down, James!
I've already thought of a way to get us out of here.
Ekans!
Ekans!
Ekans, acid.
Open a hole in the floor. We'll use it to escape.
Wait! Don't do that!
Didn't I tell you numskulls we're sinking?
You think we need another hole on this ship?
What are we supposed to do? The ship's leaking everywhere.
We've got to keep calm.
As long as there's air in here, it'll take time to fill up with water.
Sure, but we better not waste any time escaping.
Well, we can either go up or down.
Well, if we're sinking, then up would definitely be better
-and if the ship is flipped upside down... -The deck is below us
and the ship's bottom is up above our heads.
Then we have to dive down to the deck.
Pika, pika.
But if we dive down to the deck and come across a dead end,
-then we're done for. -
So how are we supposed to know?
Water's my specialty.
Go, Goldeen!
Goldeen, Goldeen. Goldeen.
Goldeen, dive down to the deck.
If you find a way off the ship, bring something back from outside.
Goldeen.
Goldeen. Goldeen?
What's taking Goldeen so long?
I guess it can't find a way out.
Team Rocket?
They look terrible!
Prepare. Prepare for trouble.
Yes, make it double.
Huh? You!
We've got you brats cornered.
So you followed us all the way to the bottom of the sea.
-Ekans! -Koffing!
-Koffing. -Ekans.
Here we go!
-Bulbasaur! -Char! Char!
-Squirtle! Squirt! -Geodude!
All right, a match.
The ship will roll if we don't do something quick.
Charmander, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Geodude, Koffing, Ekans,
to the other side of the ship!
To the other side! The other side!
Dude! Geodude!
Geodude, come back to this side!
Dude! Geodude!
You guys, call back your Pokemon.
But Team Rocket will beat us if we call our Pokemon back.
He's right.
We can't worry about that right now. We've got worse troubles.
Yeah.
Call your Pokemon back too.
What's more important, a Pokemon battle or your life?
She's right. Good point.
Okay, then, we all agree there won't be any battles for now.
Let's work together.
Come on, now. Shake hands!
Huh?
This is just a temporary truce until we get out of this mess.
Better believe it.
- -Pikachu!
Pikachu!
It's agreed we work together.
Now we gotta think of some way to escape.
Leave it to me. I forgot to mention I built my own St. Anne once.
- Huh? -Really?
It was a model.
- Ah. -Oh, great.
That's how I learned all about the structure of the St. Anne.
Since the way to the deck is blocked,
we'll have to climb to the bottom of the ship.
We can cut a hole in the hull. That's how we'll escape.
What?
Well, at least it's a plan anyway.
Over there.
Onix! Make a staircase!
- Let's hurry! - Right.
Pika.
Let's move it or lose it.
Yes, ma'am.
The lights are out. I can't see anything.
Let me handle it.
Charmander, I choose you.
Char! Char!
So where does this hall lead to?
This corridor leads straight to the engine room.
And that's where the hull is the thinnest.
With a little luck, we should be able to cut our way through.
This is no good.
It's impossible to cross to the engine room.
-Jessica? -Yes, James?
Whoever said beauty doesn't last must have been thinking of us.
I'll always remember what a wonderful dresser you were.
So will I.
Will you two knock it off?
There's gotta be some way to get off this ship!
There must be some angle we haven't thought of yet.
Think, Ash.
Pikachu, give my brain a jump start.
Pika.
Thanks. That's just what I needed.
Bulbasaur, I choose you!
Bulbasaur.
All right, Bulbasaur, vine whip. Extend your whips to the other side.
Bulba.
Bulbasaur.
-Good job. -That was a great idea, Ash.
Yeah, we can cross the vines to the other side.
Let's get out of here.
I can't cross that inferno.
Jessie and Meowth, you go ahead. I'm staying here.
James, James, James! Snap out of it!
How long do you think you'd last on this side?
Now let's go. We'll cross together.
Oh, Jessie.
Please, don't abandon me.
Don't worry. I won't leave you.
-Hey, Team Rocket! - Huh?
Bulbasaur!
Wait! Don't leave us! Send back the vine!
Now I know what a toasted marshmallow feels like.
Hey, no time to take a break.
-We've got to get off this ship quick. -Right.
Charmander, I choose you.
Char!
Charmander, we need you to weld through the metal hull of the ship
-with your flame. -Char! Char!
Mander!
Okay, listen up.
Grab hold of a water Pokemon and swim to the surface.
-Yeah, right. Got it, Ash? -I'll be okay with my Squirtle.
Hey, don't forget about us. What are we supposed to do?
Just grab a water Pokemon.
Water Pokemon?
It's almost burned through.
- -Are you crazy? What have you done?
Return, Charmander!
Now, let's go, Squirtle.
Squirtle! Squirt!
Follow us, Team Rocket!
Hold on! We haven't got the right Pokemon!
I hate water. Especially wet water.
We're in big trouble!
We can't escape without water Pokemon!
You're laughing?
I don't see what's so funny, James.
The poor guy must be cracking up just like the ship.
You really made fun of me.
But who's got the last laugh now?
Well, a true genius is never appreciated until there's trouble.
I knew we'd need this in a tight spot.
Look.
-Hey. -Could it be?
Magikarp! We're not worthy.
Feast your eyes on the king of carp.
-Magikarp. -You're the best, James.
I take back the jokes.
From now on, I'll treat you with the respect you deserve.
Hmm. Better late than never.
It's time, Magikarp.
Magikarp.
Lucky for us I bought this, even if it cost next month's salary.
Enough bragging. Just tie yourself on.
We got to escape.
All right, Magikarp, let's escape.
Magikarp. Magikarp. Magikarp. Magikarp. Magikarp. Magikarp...
Huh?
Don't tell me this fish can't swim.
Forget swim. It can barely splash.
We're doomed!
Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again!
I wonder why Team Rocket still hasn't surfaced.
Do you think they're still trapped inside?
Pikachu?
There's nothing more we can do except try to find some dry land.
Let's see.
Nothing but ocean in every direction, and no way to tell which direction to go.
I remember the story of Noah, who, when he had to find dry land,
sent a bird to find it and return with a branch.
What a great idea. We're going to do the same thing as Noah.
Pidgeotto, I choose you!
Pidgeotto, bring us back whatever you find!
Pidgeotto!
-We're counting on you, Pidgeotto. -Pikachu.
Huh?
Magikarp. Karp, Magikarp. Karp, Magikarp. Karp, Magikarp. Karp...
Pidgeotto.
They weren't able to make it.
Not even Team Rocket deserved this.
Yeah.
I guess the only decent thing to do
is to give them a traditional burial at sea.
That's right. It's our duty, even if they were our enemies.
Argh! Zombies!
-Who are you calling zombies? -We are not zombies.
Somebody help! My fur's getting wet!
Chu.
Karp, karp, karp. Karp, karp. Karp, karp, karp. Karp, karp.
I'm so hungry.
It seems like forever since we last ate.
If I'd known I was going to be starving,
I would've stuffed my face full when I was on the St. Anne.
Oh, I want some food.
Stop it.
Yeah, that whining only makes you feel even hungrier.
Karp, karp, karp. Magikarp...
Got to eat something, like filleted carp.
Or fried carp.
Karp, karp, karp. Magikarp, karp.
-Fresh, marinated carp. -Carp flambe.
Karp, Magikarp.
That's it! Dinner is now served!
I wouldn't try that again if I was you.
Check your Pokedex'cause Magikarp is just scales and bones.
I wish you'd told me that sooner.
Ugh! Not only can this fish not swim, it's not even good for eating.
See, I told you buying it was stupid.
You good-for-nothing fish!
I don't want to be your master!
Karp, karp, karp...
Good riddance, Magikarp.
-I feel sorry for it. - Huh?
Karp, karp, karp!
-What is that? -Now you've done it.
Magikarp has evolved into Gyarados.
Gyarados? I miss Magikarp.
Gyarados.
This Pokemon has a vicious temperament, so use extreme caution.
Its fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel.
I'm James, your master. Obey me.
Dimwit! If you're the master, don't act like you're scared of it.
But I am scared.
Goldeen! Starmie! Staryu!
Goldeen.
-How will you battle it? -My strategy is... run away!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Faster! Faster!
Huh?
What's it doing?
It just evolved. Maybe it's tired out.
We made it!
Unless the stories are true.
Huh?
What are you talking about, Misty?
Sailors tell terrible stories about the Gyarados.
I think this might be...
It may be dragon rage.
Dragon rage?
Help! We're Gyarados bait!
-We're doomed. -Pikachu.
Hey, what are they doing?
Dragon rage. Gyarados' ultimate attack.
Here it comes!
Let's go!
No one's ever gotten away from dragon rage!
Whoa! This is it!
Hey, Brock! Misty! Pikachu! Whatever happens, don't let go!
Pika!
Their underwater escape ends
with our heroes trapped in a water cyclone.
Talk about a fiendish twist of fate.
With things spiraling out of control,
will Ash and his friends ever make it to dry land again?
Okay, guys, we got to rap some Pokemon.
You just do the singing. I'll take care of the hard part.
Let's get it on!
