Don't, Nee-san!
Let go of me!
I absolutely will not...
Sugar Boy and... an octopus?!
That's Byro.
Guild wizards. Do you intend to defy me to the bitter end?
It's been a lot of fun, but it's about time to bring this to an end, hot boy.
Happy...
You think I'd get sick ridin' on that?
That's not transportation! It's obviously an octopus!
That thing's so gigantic, it's clearly for transport!
I feel sick just lookin' at it!
Oh, Natsu...
Spicy!
Bastard! I've had it up to here with your gooey crap!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Natsu's flames d-disappeared?!
Hot boy, Byro-sama negates his opponent's magic.
What the hell is that?! It's the first I've heard!
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
What was that?!
Baby! Come on! Grow up!
His magic absorbs his opponent's magic and takes nourishment from it.
Eliminate him, please.
As you wish.
Hold on!
Damn octopus!
Byro-sama is busy.
The Fury of Legion!
Gate of the Ram, I open thee! Aries!
I'm sorry!
Is that good enough?! I'm sorry!
Perfect timing! Thanks!
Y-You saved us!
I don't know how you did it, but you're totally tough to kill!
Here I come!
Gate of the Golden Bull, I open thee! Taurus!
Lucy-san's in a pinch
after protecting a beautiful girl from falling off a cliff!
Nice body! Hubba-hubba!
Yeah, yeah! I'm not gonna bother gettin' ticked off at you, just get her!
I'll battle mooore fiercely than ever!
No way am I gonna lose to some cow!
He's not under her control?!
As I suspected, she can only control humans!
That magic doesn't work against Celestial Spirits!
What's wrong, Taurus?!
Th-Th...
This girl's got a nice body, too! Hubba-hubba!
Hey! What the hell are you responding to?!
I'm sorta reluctant to attack a nice body...
Go home!
Lucy-neesan, your Celestial Spirits are all kind of...
How can I put it... Unique...?
That's right. I can count on them... but their characters are just...
This is no time to be talking about that!
Scorpio, please!
We are! Leave it to me! Yeah!
His character comes on strong, too...
What should I do?!
I don't think there's anything we can do when she's moving that fast!
Lily?!
I have to take her down...
Even though she's the spitting image, that's not the Coco I knew in Edolas.
I'll handle this. Everyone, get back!
What's wrong, Kanaloa?
Have you found something?
This magic power...
So you're the one who's giving off an enormous amount of magic power...
An octopus...?
Your reputation precedes you, Fairy Tail's most powerful S Class Wizard...
Gildarts Clive!
I don't know who you are... but it looks like you've come to attack Fairy Tail.
I have no business with your guild.
Oh?
Coool!
Are you still following me?
What an opportunity!
This'll be my biggest scoop in the history of the Weekly Sorcerer!
His Light and Dark Side, this coool situation comes up!
First a showdown after seven long years and now this... it's too delicious!
Which do you want me to beat down first? Your octopus? Or you?
If you insist... I'll proceed until you are eliminated.
You talk elimination or whatever, and yet you're on the defensive?
No. I just nullified your magic.
Speaking precisely, I nullified your magic against me and it discharged behind me.
You mean the nullified magic passed through you,
then charged up again and had an effect on the trees, right?!
I see...
To be honest, I don't have time to face off against you like this.
We have a mission to carry out.
A mission?
I'll eliminate you now. Please, attack me at will.
Shoot!
Scorpio! One more time!
We are! I'm gonna go with a heavy hitter!
Sand Spear!
You're wasting your time!
Lucy-neesan!
Nooo!
Michelle!
Crap! My attack hit her!
The more you fight it, the more magic it absorbs and the bigger it gets!
What should we do?!
Nothin' to it! Ain't no way I'm gonna lose against this blob!
Natsu, no!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
I hate obstinate people...
Wha...?!
What's it doin' now?!
It doesn't only absorb power,
it can take on the properties of what it's absorbed!
Natsu!
Natsu is losing to fire?! I don't believe it!
That's because the more magic it absorbs from the enemy,
the more powerful it becomes.
Do you get it, pretty blue cat?
Don't call me that!
Natsu! Get out of there!
G-Good idea...
Hey, hot boy!
Fire, come on!
My hound dog is truly the best!
Grow up! Grow! Yes!
You ain't half-bad.
You as well...
Crash?!
He nullified it again! That's amazing! Too amazing!
Coool!
I would like you to step aside.
You should clear the way by force.
Alright. Until you're out of my way then...
Y'know, you're a pain in the ass...
I could say the same about you.
So what are you after, anyway?
Why are you givin' our guild so much grief?
Giving your guild grief? You speak foolishly...
Unlike that Kain guy's controlling magic, she doesn't need to use hair...
But she can only control one person at a time,
and the effect probably only works within a set distance...
If I move far enough away, she probably won't be able to control me,
but in these circumstances...
Come clean, already!
Where is she?!
Lily! What are you doing?!
I'll do something! Roar of the Sky Dragon!
I missed!
That girl's always on the move!
Shall I put you out of your misery, hot boy?
Natsu!
Happy... Pick me up and fly!
What do you have in mind?
Anyway, fly!
Aye, sir!
You can run, but you can't hide, boy and cat!
Listen, Happy. Pitch me into that junk.
What are you saying, Natsu?! If I do that, it'll absorb your magic again...
Just do it!
Aye!
Go!
I'm sick an' tired of your slimy ass!
I don't believe this... I'd say that's the very definition of reckless...
Spicy!
What are you trying to do, Natsu?
I see!
Absorb the power! Yes! Absorb it all!
Yummy!
Wha...?! This isn't good!
Nooo! My hound dog got a blowout from eating too much?!
Well, now what are you gonna do?!
Let go of my hand!
If this absorbs your ridiculous amount of power, we'll both blow up, hot boy!
This is happening because of your damn putty! It ain't my fault!
In that case, I'll use my hound dog's increased power to just protect my fist!
I'll make your arm half-cooked!
Not if I have anything to say about it!
What are those two doing?
There's no end to this...
Coool! What a fool Jason is!
I just remembered!
He's Byro Cracy! He belongs to the Legion Corps!
Legion Corps? What's that?
Zentopia has followers all over Fiore, not to mention all over the world!
And the Legion Corps is a secret order of warriors
from the dark side of their history!
Apparently, it's comprised of fierce soldiers
who've been through training so harsh that not even a priest could endure it!
And what does this secret order want with Fairy Tail?
There's no need to tell you that.
Tell me!
Fairy Tail isn't a guild that can be crushed so easily!
That's why I'm not all that worried, to be frank.
The thing is...
Oh?
However, we only have business with Lucy Heartfilia.
What business with Lucy?!
Your eyes tell me how serious you are.
But so are we.
This is no simple mission.
The Archbishop of Zentopia has entrusted us with this...
This crusade, so to speak...
Crusade?
Indeed... It's very important that this crusade be carried out.
Get out of here!
Huh?
There's no point in being a field reporter if you die on the scene.
Now run away!
Bring it.
Found you!
Y'know, this has taken more time than I thought it would.
But that's because we didn't have any information about what you looked like...
Wake up...
Wake up, Michelle!
Awesome!
Okay, now. Come on over here!
Why are you after Lucy?!
To be precise, it's not Lucy Heartfilia herself that we want.
What we're looking for is...
Hit this bastard! Hit'im!
Before that, why don't you let go of my hand?
I'm not interested in holding hands with a man
and I hate both sweetness and obstinacy!
It's not like I'm holdin' your hand because I want to!
Then the only thing for it is to crush you until we get separated, hot boy.
Bye-bye, hot boy.
Ice Cannon!
Moron! I thought my arm was gonna snap off!
Is that what you say when someone saves your ass?
You slant-eyed bastard...
You...
And now we've got ice boy...
Spicy...
Don't call me any weird names! What the hell are you doing here?!
No, Gray! He's the Sugar Boy of Earthland!
Come on, come on. Right over here.
You people are after...
That's right. That clock hand.
We don't need you.
Erza...
This is rare. It looks like you're having a hard time.
Sorry. I can't seem to get the better of this guy...
There's nothing more unpleasant than coming back home
and finding the place overrun with scum!
I know, right?
What a simpleton! Did you really think we wanted you?!
Stop it!
I won't.
My father left me this keepsake!
I won't give it up!
Then I want it even more!
I love stealing things that are precious to people!
Please! Don't!
Michelle! Wake up!
Awesome!
Archbishop-sama, I got Mary!
That's...
A signal...
It seems the clock hand has been obtained.
What...?
Spicy...
Lucy...
Those bastards...
This ain't gonna end with Fairy Tail gettin' trounced!
I guess they weren't after Lucy after all, but that clock hand, huh?
I wonder why they want that thing...
It's obvious, ain't it?
I bet those jackasses are clock geeks!
Mmm, I don't think you're on the right track there...
Next time: Key of the Starry Sky!
If they're not geeks... Maybe it's a fetish?
So the big hand and little hand form a golden triangle...
Not a chance!
