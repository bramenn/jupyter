Katsuragi, it's me.
I'm sure you're listening to this message, after I caused you so much trouble.
Sorry.
Please tell Rit-chan I'm sorry.
And there's one more thing to trouble you with. I've been growing flowers.
I'd appreciate it if you could water them for me.
Shinji-kun knows where they are.
Katsuragi, the truth is with you. Don't hesitate. Move ahead.
If I can see you again, I'll say the words that I couldn't say 8 years ago.
Bye.
A telephone that doesn't ring...
ON BUSINESS Sorry, but don't call me
Misato-san's shutting herself up today, as usual.
Authorized Personnel ONLY If you enter without my permission, you shall die! Entry Forbidden!
Asuka... she isn't coming back?
She doesn't go to school or home, she just plays games all day.
Hikari...
Hmm, what?
Let's go to bed.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I'm causing you a lot of trouble.
No, you're not.
I lost. I'll never pilot an Eva again. Now, it's not worth living.
I lost all my values for everything.
I hate this. I hate everyone. I hate everything.
Though I hate myself the most.
Now I don't care about anything. I have nothing to do.
I think you can do anything you want to. I don't blame you.
I really think you've done well.
Well, that child is gone.
Hmm, probably.
Even cats die.
Don't cry, Grandma.
Mm, I'll come home when I have time to.
I haven't been to my mom's grave in three years.
Next time, I'll call you.
OK, I have to go.
So, that cat died.
It's impossible for us to retrieve the Lance of Longinus.
Why did you use it?
And about the Eva series, we don't have all of them scheduled.
The annihilation of the Angel was more important. There was no other way.
No other way? Your excuses should be more persuasive.
The things you have done recently are too bold.
Fuyutsuki, I'm in conference.
Understood.
An Angel is approaching right now.
We'll finish this discussion at the next opportunity.
That is, if your chair remains.
Ikari, are you going to betray us, SEELE?
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Launch Unit 00 from the 32nd gate. Set Unit 02 as backup.
No, I don't have the right to cancel Commander Ikari's freeze on Unit 01. Bye.
Angel confirmed visually... right?
Unit 00 launched. Deploying to interception point.
Unit 02, wait at your present position.
No, sortie.
Commander!?
I don't care. At least it might be useful as a decoy.
Yes, sir.
Eva Unit 02, preparing for launch.
I'm on board again, as usual.
Oh, no. Am I still synched to this?
Send Unit 02 to Gate Eight.
As soon as a location is designated, we'll launch.
Even if I sortie, all I can do is disturb the others.
Target's approaching and is past the Gora Final Interception Line.
I don't care about anything, anymore.
Target is rotating in the air over Owakidani valley.
Target's AT Field is still active.
Where have you been?
I don't have an excuse. Present status?
Still a stalemate.
Changing cyclically from pattern blue to orange.
What does that mean?
The MAGI are still working on the answer.
The data is insufficient to find an answer.
But I'm sure that shape isn't fixed.
Our side can't attack first.
Rei, we'll observe its status for a while.
No, it's coming.
Rei, prepare for battle!
No! It's too late!
Target has physically contacted Unit 00.
Unit 00's AT Field?
Active, but being penetrated.
The Angel is trying to achieve first level contact with Unit 00?
Danger! Unit 00's bioparts are being penetrated.
Eva Unit 02, sortie! Have her rescue Rei and provide cover.
Target is penetrating Unit 00.
This is dangerous. 5 has already been bio-fused.
Asuka, advance 300 meters and spread your AT Field,
then fire the palette gun at the Target's back.
Alright? Eva Unit 02, lift off!
Move out! Asuka?! What's wrong?
Unit 02's status?
Impossible. Synchro ratio is under 10.
Asuka!
It doesn't move. It doesn't move.
Like this, she'll be a victim too. Retrieve her! Hurry!
Who? Me? Me within Eva?
No, I feel someone else other than me.
Who are you? An Angel?
A being that we call an Angel?
Don't you want to be unified with me?
No. I am I. Not you.
Hmm, but you shall be. It's too late.
I give you part of my mind.
I give you this emotion.
Pain... See, your mind has pain.
Pain? No, something different.
Loneliness. Yes,loneliness.
Loneliness? I don't understand.
Do you hate being alone?
We are many, but you are alone. You hate it, don't you?
That's called loneliness.
That's your mind. Full of sorrow.
That's your own mind.
These are tears?
It's me who's crying?
Rei!
The freeze on Unit 01 is canceled, effective immediately.
Sortie as soon as possible.
Sortie!
Yes, sir!
Am I so worthless to you? You didn't do this for me.
Spread your AT Field. Rescue Rei immediately.
Yes!
Ikari-kun!
Shinji-kun, use your prog knife!
It hurts, doesn't it Ikari-kun?
Is this my wish? To be one with Ikari-kun?
No!
AT Field has been reversed! It will be corroded immediately.
To hold the Angel?
Field limit reached! The core can't hold up much longer!
Rei! Abandon the unit and escape!
No. If I escape, the AT Field will disappear.
I won't let it.
Rei, do you want to die?
The core is collapsing, critical pressure exceeded!
The target has disappeared.
This operation is finished.
Move to level one alert.
Roger. Moving to situation yellow immediately.
Unit 00's status?
Entry plug ejection not recognized.
Rescue the pilot as soon as possible. Hurry!
You mean, if there still is one.
Still unable to find the constituent matter for section 16. Location efforts proceeding.
Dr. Akagi...
This is top secret. Scavenge the plug.
Dispose of the parts concerned.
Roger.
Do it immediately.

Aye. After losing the Lance of Longinus, we lost Eva Unit 00.
That's sufficient reason to dismiss Ikari.
He must understand why we returned Fuyutsuki alive.
We have to find another pawn to use against Ikari.
And this one must know the truth.
Shinji-kun, I'm coming in.
Misato-san, the tears won't come.
I think I'm sad, but tears never come.
Shinji-kun, all I can do for you is this.
Stop it! No, Misato-san.
I'm very sorry.
I'm sure he's feeling lonely. Is he afraid of women?
No, he's just afraid of affection in general.
Pen Pen, come here.
Okay, I just want anybody. I'm the one who's lonely.
It's me who's lonely.
Rei...
The product of my despair, and yet the object of your hope.
I guess it's impossible to forget her.
Yes, hello. Really?!
Shinji-kun!
Dr. Odani of the First Internal Department...
Dr. Odani, please contact the second conference room immediately.
Ayanami!
First Neurological Surgery Third Surgery
2nd Floor Hospital Ward Radiation Diagnosis X-ray Reception
I'm glad, you're alive!
But, my father isn't here?
Thank you. You saved me.
What?
You saved me, by sacrifying Unit 00.
Oh, did I save you?
Yeah. Don't you remember?
No... I mean, I don't know.
I think, probably, I'm the third.
Are these tears?
I'm seeing this for the first time, but it feels familiar.
Am I crying?
Why am I crying?
That's right. Preserve the present status for the First Children.
No restrictions are necessary.
This applies to the Second and Third as well. Just watch them.
If they find out Rei is alive, Chairman Keel and the others will cause trouble.
I'll present something else to the old men of SEELE.
There's no problem.
We wish to proceed peacefully.
We don't wish you to suffer from insults anymore.
I don't feel any insult.
A strong tempered woman.
I can see why Ikari wants to keep her next to him.
However, it was none other than Ikari who presented you to us.
Rejecting the interrogation of the pilot of Unit 00,
he presented you as her replacement, Doctor Akagi.
I'm Rei's substitute, am I?
ON BUSINESS Sorry, but don't call me
The way to the truth which you wanted, was sent to you by 36 other methods.
But those won't reach you.
The only one guaranteed is this capsule.
It's completely up to you how to use this.
The pass code is our first memory.
Bye, Take care.
I'm not upset anymore by the telephone that doesn't ring...
Are you sure about releasing Doctor Akagi?
She isn't like Fuyutsuki. It will be beneficial to release her.
She rendered remarkable service to the Eva series.
She should be useful to us for a while.
Yes, for the future of humanity.
Regarding Evangelions, eight of them are under construction.
So, there are four more to go.
The disappearance of Tokyo-3 will enhance the project.
Hurry with the completion. The promised day will be that day.
Yes, hello.
Listen to me. You're free from the secret service right now.
You can go out now.
Ritsuko-san...
No good, without my pass.
I see. Kaji-kun arranged this?
The secret of this place must be revealed before my eyes.
Alright. But this one will see it as well.
Very well.
This looks just like Ayanami's room.
Ayanami Rei's room. This is the place where she was born.
In this room?
Yes, her birth place.
Light and water, which make up Rei's deep mentality, reflect the image of this place.
Dr. Akagi, I didn't come to see this.
I know, Misato.
Eva?
The first one. A failure.
Disposed of ten years ago.
A graveyard for Evas.
Nothing but a dumping ground.
This is also the place where your mother disappeared.
You probably don't remember but you were watching it,
watching the moment when your mother disappeared.
Ritsuko!
You say this is the core of the dummy plug?
I'll show you the truth.
Ayanami... Rei.
What? Eva's dummy plug is...
Yes. These are about to be the core of the dummy system.
This is the factory for manufacturing them.
This is...?
These are dummies.
And nothing but spare parts for Rei.
Humans found a god, and thus tried to obtain it.
As a result, humanity was punished! That was 15 years ago.
The god that they found vanished.
However, Man tried to resurrect God with his own hands,
and created Adam. From Adam, man created what resembles God.
That is Eva.
Human? Is that a human?
Yes, that's a human.
Eva, which originally didn't have a soul, now has a human soul.
All of these were salvaged.
However the vessel which truly contains a soul is Rei. Only she has a soul.
None of the other vessels have a soul.
There was nothing within the room of Gauf.
These are empty containers. They have no souls.
Nothing but vessels.
So I'll destroy them, because I hate them.
Do you know what you're doing?!
Yeah, I know. Destruction.
These are not human, but human-shaped things.
I lost against the THING. I couldn't win.
When he's in my mind, I can bear any insult.
I don't care about my own body.
But... but he... he chose...
I knew that.
I'm stupid. I... I'm as stupid as my mother. So foolish!
You can kill me, if you wish.
I'd be glad if you did.
You're truly stupid if you wish that.
This is the tragedy of people possessed by Eva.
I'm also one of them.
To be continued...

The city that the boy had been protecting disappears.
The friends that the boy had been close to leave.
The girls that the boy had been drawn to turn to fear.
Shinji has lost all his emotional supports,
but a new boy smiles upon him in the dusk.
Shinji gives himself over to the smile
that seems to envelop all the sins he has ever committed.
But a cruel fate was in store for them.
