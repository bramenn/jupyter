What are you doing there?
H- huh? Who are you?
Me?
I am...
Scratch... scratch... scratch...
Eh, there's a mosquito...
A mosquaito...
'skaito...
Kaio!
Then, who is... huh?
That there is my pet, Bubbles- kun.
Ohhh...
I thought it was a little strange.
You're the strange one.
By the way...
Don't you think that play on words just now was the greatest?
You don't have to be afraid to laugh at it.
At what?
You were too tense to hear it, huh?
What am I going to do with you, for pity's sake?
Well then, at no extra charge, I'll hit you with a different play on words.
Hello? Hello?
Huh? I picked up the phone, but no one was home!
That's great!
What was?
What did you come here for?
Oh, I was hoping to have you train me, Kaio- sama.
Train you!?
Go home now!
Anyone who hears a joke like that and doesn't laugh has a flawed character!
You expect me to train anyone like that!?
That was hilarious! I should have expected as much, Kaio- sama!
I ain't ever heard anything so funny!
It was, wasn't it?
You were just slow to notice it, that's all.
Are you going to train me?
Train you, huh? I wouldn't mind doing that.
Really!?
Provided that...
You have to make me, Kaio- sama, the mastermind of gags,
laugh at one of your plays on words.
I have to make a play on words!?
Are you getting cold feet?
If the pun is not at an adequate enough level, I won't laugh at it.
Well, how about it?
Apparently, you're not up to it. If that's so, then give up, and go home!
M- my futon...
flew away, gone!
Your futon... flew away gone!?
Just a little more!
My feline...
My stylus is sightless!
Ah, you laughed! Kaio- sama, you laughed!
My futon flew away, gone!
You're no slouch at this, huh? You're a pro, aren't you?
Very well, I will give you my training. I will teach you...
N- never mind the gags, teach me martial arts.
What, you want to learn martial arts? Why didn't you say so sooner?
All right, come at me! I want to see what kind of skill you possess.
What's the matter!?
It's just that there's something strange going on.
It's awfully hard to move, and my body feels so heavy.
Where did you come from, Earth?
Then it would be heavy here, huh?
This is a small planet, but it has incredible gravity, see?
I'll bet it's about ten times what it is on your planet.
That means your own weight is ten times greater.
See how high you can jump. As hard as you can.
O- okay...
It's no use! That little bit is as high as I can go!
lf he can jump that high in ten times his normal gravity...
This guy here has a lot of promise!
Okay then, we will start your training.
How much time do you plan to spend with me?
I ain't sure how many days it took for me to run down the Serpentine Road...
But I don't think I have much time.
I'm told that there are these Saiyan guys who are coming to our
planet to do some awful stuff.
So I'd like for you to train me until that time, however short it is!
Saiyans, huh?
You've had some nasty folks set their sights on you, all right. Well then...
I'll check into when these Saiyans are going to reach Earth for you.
The Saiyans are flying that way, all right.
They will arrive on Earth in... let's see... about 158 days, I'd say.
Awesome! You can tell that!?
Yeah, these handy antenna are reliable, an' tenna some!
That was great!
Maybe I should give up training you.
That was great! That was great! That was great!
Wasn't it?
Still, there's only 158 days until the Saiyans arrive, huh?
Hey, 158 days will be plenty.
Me training you on this planet for 158 days will have the same value
as if you trained for a thousand years on Earth.
Really!?
However...
Even if you do train with me,
there's no guarantee that you will be able to beat the Saiyans.
The two Saiyans that are headed for Earth have just that much awesome power.
To be honest with you, their strength is even greater than my own.
Even greater than yours, Kaio- sama!?
That's right.
Which means that if you cannot at least surpass me,
it will be impossible for you to beat the Saiyans.
Okay then, how about we get started right away?
Hey! Bubbles- kun!
First off...
For the time being, until you can move fast enough to do that,
nothing else will matter.
A- all right...
Okay, run away, Bubbles- kun!
Wait up!
Damn! My body is really heavy!
Dammit! All right, then...
Watch this!
I'm going to get you!
Ho! So he's already wearing super-weighted gear, is he?
That makes me quite a bit lighter, now!
Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
All right, you're mine!
It can't be! You're kidding me, right?
What do you think?
He sure is fast! I'm not sure I can catch him.
If you can't, then go home right now.
That's right- I ain't eaten anything since I left the Snake Princess' place.
Say, I hate to ask, but could you give me something to eat?
Well, okay. That's unusual- a hungry deceased person...
Hey, how about showing a little restraint?
I'm down ing the donburi!
Down ing the donburi!
Where's the joke there?
I'm full, I'm full!
The taste notwithstanding, at least my stomach is full!
I get the feeling that maybe this man isn't giving me enough respect.
By the way, Kaio- sama,
I'm surprised you don't find it dull staying on a planet this small.
So young...
If you set your mind to it, there are any number of fun things to do here.
Like counting how many blades of grass there are growing...
gazing up at the sky...
long-distance peeing...
Recently, I've been getting into a new hobby...
Going for drives.
Now, hurry up and catch Bubbles- kun.
Otherwise, you'll never be able to get me to teach you any martial arts.
Right! I'll give it my all!
All righty!
Oh, right!
Put on those heavy-looking clothes and boots you took off earlier and then run after him.
That will be more effective.
But putting that stuff on makes it even harder to run!
Let me tell you something.
The planet that the Saiyans are from had about the same gravity as here.
That's where they built up their bodies.
Do you now understand part of the secret to the Saiyans' strength?
But it's more than just that.
Saiyans are born with a natural fighting sense.
That's another thing that makes them so formidable.
Hey, that's fine! I'm a Saiyan, too!
Nice thrust.
Don't slow down your attack!
Uncle...
help me.
Don't be so needy, you dirty brat!
Sure enough, he only exhibits those dormant abilities of his
on the night of the full moon.
Yow-ow-ow-ow...
Looks like you at least cured yourself of being a crybaby
over the last half-year, huh?
Say, Piccolo- san, you fought with Father a long time ago, right?
Our fight is not yet over.
If we're able to defeat the Saiyans, your father's turn comes next.
But Father told me that the reincarnated Piccolo- san
didn't seem to be the same terribly evil person he was before.
I sort of think that, too. Mother and Grandpa are still afraid of you, though.
Stop talking nonsense and get to sleep!
Tomorrow, we won't have the kind of gentle training we did today!
R- right...
Damn him anyway...
Since then, three weeks have gone by in the blink of an eye...
These shao-mai dumplings taste so good...
they taste shao good, I think you'll find.
That was great! That was great!
Huh? Nobody heard that one?
Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!
I've got gyoza by the gross!
Hold it!
Now!
So close!
All right!
He's in good spirits, huh?
Hold it!
He definitely doesn't have the slightest respect for me!
Yow-ow-ow...
He really is incredible, huh? But I'm not giving in!
Hold up!
I'm so close!
I know!
All right...
Hold it!
Bubbles- kun, I found you!
Hold it!
I did it!
Wow! I finally did it! I caught him!
He's as amazing as I thought. He's already overcome the gravity here, has he?
He might be able to handle it! The Kaio-ken technique...
The Saiyans' assault is not far away.
What kind of training will Goku receive from Kaio-sama,
now that he has finally met him?
