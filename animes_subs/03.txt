Man, I'm starved.
I gotta go to the school store.
Okay. I'll get started without you.
It's been about a month since school started.
That's so cute!
Cute as a button!
The uneasiness and anxiety that made my first few days so uncomfortable were gone.
Everyone found their comfort zone in the class and opened up to each other.
Except for a certain someone,
lost in the dark, far-flung reaches of her eighth-grader syndrome.
Takanashi, you always bring so much for lunch.
I need to store large amounts of energy for upcoming battles.
If I ran out of mana at a crucial time, the consequences could be fatal.
Well, it's not like I can talk.
In times of war, it is vital to secure adequate sustenance.
I wanna go back and punch myself in the face!
That's some lunch there.
In times of war, it is vital to secure adequate sustenance.
Don't remind me!
Did you make it yourself?
The Priestess did.
Ah, Tooka? I guess she's a better cook than you'd think.
I'll let her know it far exceeded your expectations, then.
I don't think she needs to know that.
The Priestess works as a cook in the real world as a cover for her true identity.
Well, if she's such a great cook, I'd
These red ones burn your mana.
They're extremely dangerous.
So you don't like tomatoes?
Especially that gooey green part.
People must be insane to eat something like that.
They look like the eggs of magical monsters.
Apologize to the tomato producers!
I must isolate the contamination in my rice!
Oh, whatever. I'll eat it for you.
Oh, crap...
N-No! It's not what you think it is!
Death!
Next up is the karate club.
Hey, Yuuta, which club are you gonna join?
I don't really know yet.
You?
The Light Music Club!
Really? I didn't know you were so into music.
Come on, man.
Show me one guy who joined the Light Music Club because he was into music.
What's the purpose of rock? Why do electric guitars exist?
Exactly! It's all about the girls!
Chicks dig musicians, don't you know?
That's quite the narrow view you have there.
Or is it just your unpopularity complex?
Shut up while you can!
I spent my junior high years in the baseball team with a crewcut!
In two months from now, I'll have a guitar on my shoulder and a girlfriend by my side!
And another girl longing for me in the background!
Clubs, huh?
Ow!
When this is over, rendezvous at the headstone of fallen leaves.
Rikka.
What does that even mean?
You seriously look like you're about to confess to me.
I can use this as a weapon.
Anyway, what do you want?
Our time is short.
Let me get straight to the point.
I want to establish a stronghold in this school.
Stronghold?
I want to form a new club.
Sorry, that was so surreal that I had trouble comprehending it.
Come again, please?
Petero via vaniste.
Pardon me. I accidentally used the language of the Otherworld.
It uses a writing system that's exactly the mirror of this world's and
Please, spare me the pointless exposition.
What did you say?
I'll form a new club to serve as our base of operations in the school.
It shall be named as such.
Far Eastern... Magic... Society?
Well, good luck with that.
Wait.
Just grab my sleeve or something!
Anyway, sign here.
You seriously expect me to?
As I thought.
Fine.
I'll settle for vice-president.
The presidency is yours.
That's not the problem here!
Would anyone even join?
Don't worry about that.
This is unsettling indeed. Why isn't anybody interested?
Why would they be?
Now I'm sure that it's the Ethereal Horizon Overseers getting in my way!
Jeez, what a weirdo.
Stop it! You're bothering people!
Uh... What is it?
Yuuta, I'll leave the rest to you.
You're being way too shy!
Uh...
My Wicked Eye tells me...
Wicked?
I sense an impure soul clinging to you.
Only the powers of darkness may exorcise it.
Join the Far Eastern Magic Society, and by the power of my Wicked Eye I shall
Nope, that trick won't do.
Sorry. Please ignore her.
I'm really sorry.
Jeez.
What are you
Oh my, what a coincidence!
Nap Club?
Yeah. You interested?
It's always nice to nap!
It's lots of fun too!
Sorry, I'm not that interested.
Everyone says that...
I tried to form it last year too,
but for some reason nobody wanted to join.
A pillow?
Yeah. It's sunny today, so I brought my good weather pillow.
With this, I'll dream of grassy meadows!
Yuuta!
I think you just made it even worse.
The green is teasing me!
Is she really dreaming of grassy meadows?
Perhaps the local magic coefficient is insufficient to allow for further growth...
Nibutani?
I gotta use the bathroom for a sec.
Those clothes... No doubt about it!
Don't overdo it, okay?
Okay!
Ah, you did come.
I thought you would.
Why are you here?
For Nibutani Shinka! She's trying out for the cheerleaders.
There's no way I'd miss a chance like this!
Just look how many guys are here from the class!
She's that popular?
Of course!
She was voted number one in the cutie poll, after all!
Yes!
Number one, huh?
Hey, don't tell me...
No, no! I wouldn't even dream of it!
Our eyes just met by chance!
And Takanashi too?!
Could we get any luckier?
That idiot...
When she heard about the cheerleaders jumping around with those pom-poms,
she said she wanted to try.
I wonder if they'd let me try it if I said I was a freshman.
Sure you're okay up there?
In my battles for the Ethereal Horizon,
I've soared a thousand meters high through otherworldly skies! This is nothing!
What is she saying?
I wish I knew.
How is it? Want to jump?
Or would you rather not?
P-Piece of cake!
Are you okay?
P-Piece of cake!
Are you crying?
Piece of cake.
Too big a piece for you.
You shall not pass!
Taste the flames of my wrath!
That's the drama club.
I'm on my way to meet someone I haven't seen in ten years! Please!
What's this?
It's an etude.
Improvised practice to widen the range of our acting.
This is a bridge.
Two people arrive at a bridge where only one can pass at any given time.
They have to improvise to try and convince the other person to let them across first.
You win if your opponent gets out of the way.
If you wish to pass, you must defeat me first!
He's not talking to you!
Wanna try?
I'm sorry, but please let me cross!
His plane is due to take off any minute!
If I don't tell him how I feel now, we'll probably never ever meet again!
Trash.
Watch out! A bear's coming!
I shall take control of your mind with my Wicked Eye.
Out of my way!
Watch out!
Schwarz Sechs Prototype Mark II!
If you wish to pass, you must defeat me first!
Dark Matter Blaze!
You were able to block it?
How can a man of the Light be here?!
You shall stand aside!
I broke through!
Cut it out.
I tried to get across how much better we are than the other clubs,
but people still won't join.
Why?
Why do you think?!
I have no choice.
I must call in reinforcements.
You have an idea, Rikka?
It's me.
The Cardinal has made a move.
As per the orders of the Vatican Magic Society, we have no choice but to blah blah blah.
Immediate contact is requested.
Wait, did you just say blah blah blah? I heard you!
We shall meet tomorrow.
I've got a really bad feeling about this.
Sorry for calling you out like this!
What's up?
What do you want to talk about?
This is a bit embarrassing, so I'm only going to say it once.
I think I...
You think what?
L-O-V-E!
Love you!
That tickles... Hey, that tickles!
I get it, I get it...
You've finally returned from the brink of death,
Dark Flame Master.
Who the heck are you?!
Foolish mortal. Don't you know you should name yourself first before asking others?
I'm sorry! I'll tell you! I'll tell you!
Who are you?
Please untie me first...
I'm the foremost servant of the Wicked Eye user Takanashi Rikka.
My Mighty Mjolnir Maul makes men meet their mortality. Dekomori Sanae...
stands before you!
Get lost.
She's my servant.
Yuuta's mind is warped by the Overseers' sorcery.
He may act strange at times.
Please forgive him.
Indeed. His eyes are that of a commoner rotten to the core.
Should I pull the trigger?
I shall purge your soul!
Mjolnir Korven!
I can't move.
She's nuts...
Holy crap, she's for real.
How fares the Otherworld?
The intensifying battle leaves behind nothing but death.
I took part in as many fights as I could in the face of death.
Sorry for making you come all this way.
But this is essential step toward conquering the Ethereal Horizon.
You know, you sound twice as nuts when you're not alo
Wait, your uniform...
You're from our school's junior high division?
I'm the same age as the Second and Third Children.
And that makes you happy?
I found Dekomori two years ago,
when my Wicked Eye resonated in the Electric Ocean,
and I realized she was my servant in a previous life.
So you met on the Internet?
She'll join the Far Eastern Magic Nap Society.
Now we have four members.
The fifth and final member we require to establish a club shall be...
There's no way they'll approve of that!
Come to school after class, and bring the chimera.
That way we can establish our stronghold.
Sorry,
but cats don't count as club members...
But this chimera is my servant!
A being of the same rank as Dekomori!
Yes! Just like me, it serves to the death!
You're not even going to disagree?
You should find someone else to join you.
Actually, we have someone.
That invisible spirit over there who agreed to help us.
Indeed!
Really!
Please don't encourage them!
Not to mention there's also another personality that resides within me.
One moment. She's about to surface.
Oh, nice to meet you. I am Catherine.
I'm bound to live within this girl until her death.
I'm going home.
Amazing!
What country is Catherine from?
Are you playing along, Nana?
I was first born in England during the 18th century.
Oh! H-Hello!
You too?!
Nice to meet you!
Then... what do you think of Rikka?
Come again?
What do you think of Rikka?
O-Oh!
Yes...
C-Could you speak Japanese?
It's easy for you to talk in English, right?
My eye... My eye!
My eye!
She's gone...
Then I'm afraid I can't accept her as a member.
Nana, that innocent look of yours belies true cunning.
But I don't want to see you sad, so...
Here lies our final destination.
I sense no traces of magic,
but they may merely be hidden. Be careful.
I know.
That was nice of Ms. Nanase.
She'll recommend us as a circle if we can get this place in order.
Oh, really?
I get the feeling she's just using us, though.
Let me test you again. Will you remain my master, or meet your death?
Takanashi Rikka...
No, the Wicked Eye.
Very well.
I would expect no less of my servant.
Come.
Blast reality!
Burst it into shreds!
Banishment... this world!
Face your death!
Lunatic Mjolnir Crusher!
Judgment Lucifer!
Eternal Salamander Shie
Royal Revolution!
Laplace Sphere!
Give it a break!
You sure took your time. Was it that dirty?
Well, things came up...
Oh well.
You worked hard, so I'll recommend you as a circle instead.
Really?
Hooray!
My Nap Club is finally a reality!
You can use the room you cleaned today.
Okay!
And do your best to get approved as a club.
We'll start tomorrow.
Don't neglect the preparations.
Yes, my master!
You too, Yuuta!
Huh? I never said I would join.
Oh, no! Were your actions today mere deception?
You're acting more and more like Rikka.
What, are you actually disappointed?
Why does it have to be me?
It'll be fine.
Don't worry.
According to Mabinogion's Rainbow Manuscript,
wielders of the dark flames will always obey the master of the Wicked Eye.
What's that weird book?
It's a book written by Forest Summer, a mage I first learned of on the Electric Ocean,
who writes about all phenomena throughout this world from birth to death!
Looks totally legit.
Wow, that's amazing!
This is the source of all knowledge!
Wassup!
Your heart started racing, right?
Not at all.
I'm telling you now, it won't be as easy as you think.
Don't worry. You'll see.
By the way, I heard you joined some weird circle.
I didn't! I swear!
But what about that Far Eastern whatever?
I said I didn't join! Nor do I plan to!
Togashi!
Got a moment?
What?
I decided to join your circle!
I just handed in my application.
No way!
It's true.
And to show my gratitude, I adjusted the name of the club accordingly.
Far Eastern Magic Nap Society... of Summer?
You're kidding me...
