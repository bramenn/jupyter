This 50-times gravity is as tough as you'd expect.
Yamucha and the others must be going at it.
l wonder if it's the same training that I did.
No, I can't afford to be doing that.
Damn...
Mock me, will you?
O- one more time!
And he was so close, too?
M- my body is so heavy...
You almost had him, huh?
All right, now me.
Here goes!
Ten- san, good luck!
Don't rush, now. Take your time.
What?
I have no intention of doing the same training as those guys.
Teach me your techniques now.
I can't do that. There is an order to these things, you know... huh?
Anyhow, when you try to jump straight to the end, things are apt to turn out badly.
By the way, if you're not doing anything, would you like to pull weeds with me?
Why are you in such a hurry to grow stronger?
You promised me that you had given up on defeating Freeza, didn't you?
For shame. Liars have to swallow a thousand needles, you know.
For that matter, you should be enjoying your life here in the Next World more.
This can be quite fun to do.
Hmph! You're just playing the fool.
Huh? Are you leaving?
D- damn...
Hey! Let's eat!
Son Goku was something else, but you guys eat a lot too, huh?
We can't be outdone by Goku!
If he ate 10 bowls, then I'll eat 20!
Hey, come on now! If you don't stop now, you'll eat my portion, too...
Besides,
it's pretty good.
Oh, it is, it is, huh?
I know I may not look it, but when I was a youngster, I went to this cooking class,
and I was so good the teacher there told me I would make a good husband someday,
so I'm somewhat confident of my ability to- huh? Hey, you guys!
Ah, all full, all full...
Good grief. The dead these days have no sense of moderation.
Okay, now that my belly is full, I'll be fine.
I'll catch you this time for sure.
You won't be able to do that to me any longer.
Got you!
He did it!
I did it!
I'm surprised you can get by on just water.
I did it!
You did it, Tenshinhan!
Ten- san, incredible!
Those guys are something else.
Once they've gotten a handle on this, they'll make rapid progress.
Don't you think so?
I have no interest in those small fry.
I will not allow the existence of anyone stronger than me. That's all there is to it.
I caught him! Look!
Oh? Oh, my! Even Chaozu has mastered this, has he?
I see. All right, I'll give you your next training lesson.
Hey, Gregory!
Hi! Hello, everybody! I am Gregory!
This guy is your next opponent.
Please knock me down as hard as you can with this hammer.
You don't need to hold back.
However...
That assumes that you can keep up with my speed.
All right, I'll do it.
Here.
W- what's with this weight!?
Ready? Here we go!
B- bring it on!
Okay...
Too slow, too slow!
D- damn!
Yamucha, hang in there!
Yamucha- san, fight!
Hey, Piccolo, aren't you going to do this?
It's a waste of time. I'll train by myself.
Piccolo...
Chaozu...
What's the matter? Are you giving up already?
D- dammit!
Hey! We're going to take a nap now!
Piccolo is sleeping comfortably out back. Don't push yourselves too hard.
I- I'm not about to be lumped in with that guy! I'm up next!
My, my...
Oh, dear...
There's someone even stronger than that Saiyan.
How is he?
His condition is fairly serious. His life signs are extremely faint.
Even if he does pull through, I'm not sure whether or not he will regain consciousness.
Make sure he recovers, no matter what it takes!
Use whatever methods you have to, understand!?
Y- yes, sir.
Otherwise, it will mean my life.
All right...
Hey, hey! You can do it, you can do it!
Chaozu, go easy on him! Easy!
-Okay, this is it, the bottom of the 9th, 2 outs, bases loaded! -All right, Chaozu, go!
-The count is 3-2. If he runs away, the walk scores a run, and it's goodbye! -Knock it out of here!
M- me, run away!? You're trying to make a fool of me!
V- very well, I'll show you! It's not going to be that easy!
Any time you're ready.
W- why, you! Hit this one, if you can!
Not so fast! Forkball!
Crack!
W- w- what was that!?
When you go out, call out to someone first, and lock everyone else out!
That was a come-from-behind, bases-loaded, say-goodbye home run.
Oh my, Gregory, what are you doing?
With Chaozu's hit just now, we've all cleared him.
That's right.
What's that? Is this true, Gregory?
T- these guys didn't hold back at all.
Wow, that was fast, huh?
Oh, my, just over an hour? Are you sure you're not going too fast?
Okay, Kaio- sama, please give us our next training.
Next, we will spar.
Nothing is better than sparring to learn each other's
strengths and weaknesses, after all.
As a matter of fact, we've been waiting for this.
Ready to go at it?
Oh, hold on, hold on, I'll determine the match-ups.
Let's see, who should I put you with?
I'll do this!
Oh ho, you've woken up, have you? All right then, Piccolo and-
-All the rest of them. -Wha-?
What!?
You think I can fight decently against someone
who had trouble with a monkey, or some batter?
At your level, even if there were ten of you, you'd still be a pushover.
You bastard, now you've said it!
My, my, what a humorless conversation this is. Did you come here to fight?
Well, there is some truth to what Piccolo says.
Kaio- sama!
To be honest, at your current ability, a one-on-one fight would be absurd.
But with all three of you, perhaps-
Don't be ridiculous!
They don't even have a 1 in 10,000 chance of winning.
What's the matter? You want to go at it?
All right!
Watch this. l'll put you away in five seconds.
Ready? Begin!
What!?
What the-!?
They're surprisingly tough, aren't they?
Whooee! That smarts!
W- why, you!
W- why, you!
Chaozu!
Are you okay, Chaozu!?
Hey, don't panic.
-You guys are already dead. You don't need to worry yourself pointlessly. -But...
The pain of the body is just a remnant of when you were alive. It will soon be gone.
Huh?
See?
How? Up until a little while ago, their movements were so slow,
and suddenly, l barely recognize them.
ls this because of Kaio's training? lt couldn't be...
Resume sparring!
Piccolo...
Take off your weights.
Yeah, and then we'll fight you again.
That same trick isn't going to work anymore.
All right!
Okay, that's enough.
That's all for sparring. We're moving on to the next training. Everyone come with me.
Oh, right...
A vegetable you eat in the morning ( asa ) that makes you fart is called asa -para-gas...
That was a great one!
R- right...
There's quite a bit of damage here. There may be no hope.
I'm counting on you. If you don't regain consciousness,
l'm the one who Freeza- sama is going to take it out on, after all.
Then again, even if you do come back to life here,
you'll be on your way to hell again by Freeza- sama's hand soon enough anyhow.
That should do it.
Well, all there is to do now is wait for you to wake up.
Don't give us any more trouble, okay?
Vegeta- chan?
How is Vegeta?
He should regain consciousness shortly.
That is good, huh?
Y- yes, sir.
W- what was that explosion just now!?
It cannot be!
Looks like you've underestimated my powers of recovery, huh?
Now, then...
Dammit, it's coming from the treatment chamber, all right!
Zarbon- san, hurry!
Oh, no! He escaped outside!
He did what!?
Terrific, Freeza is with him!
Hurry! Hurry and go after him!
Why, you!
Hurry! You must find him at all costs! He could not have gotten far yet!
Fools! You fell for it all too easily.
Dear Freeza-sama,
Allow me to take this current opportunity to inform you that your era is at an end.
- Your loving Vegeta
I have won!
Vegeta, the miracle man who returned from the brink of death...
Will he be able to outwit Freeza and collect the Dragon Balls?
