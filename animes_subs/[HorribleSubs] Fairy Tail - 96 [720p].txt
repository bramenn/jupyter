I wonder why the sky looks so lonely?
This is Edolas after Natsu and the others left.
Hey, bring me some more bricks!
That Great Demon Lord sure did a number on us...
Things are destroyed all over!
Well, now...
Anyway, now we have to rebuild the city, right?
Let's work hard, everyone! We might not have magic, but we can still do this!
That's an excellent spirit they have.
He Who Erases Life.
I've brought him.
Hey, hey, hey! Hold it a sec!
What do you want, Lucy Loser?
It's true that I told you to think up a way to move the guild...
But what the hell is this?!
You want us to pull it ourselves?
We don't have any other choice! All the magic power's gone...
You thinkin' of escapin', huh?
O-Of course not!
Oh, I know!
I'll just tow'er with this.
Check out the horsepower on my ride...
Oh yeah, baby, I'm coool!
Go Fire!
Uh?
What was that?
A magic four-wheeler without any magic power is less useful than a push cart.
Juvia-chan, your mind is so sharp!
It's still more useful than you.
Ouch...
I'm sorry!
I never expected anything out of you anyway!
Ouch!
Listen up! We're dragging this thing to the Royal City at least!
Take your stations!
Let's go, Nee-chan.
Yeah...
Um, what are you doing?
You expect delicate maidens such as ourselves to carry such a heavy load?
D-Delicate?!
The Royal City has entered a new era.
Everyone's hearts are looking toward the future.
But they have not forgotten about your existence.
I must decide on an appropriate punishment, and uphold justice.
I understand.
Faust, I order you banished from the Royal City.
You will never be allowed to set foot in this city again.
But...
Erza Knightwalker.
Without my permission, you are not allowed to leave the Royal City.
I would gladly accept execution...
Suit yourself.
No. You will be put to work with the citizens in reconstruction.
Bydo, Sugar Boy, Hughes...
You will receive the same punishment as Erza Knightwalker.
That is all.
What is the meaning of this?
Whoa... I mean, like, whoa I can't just accept that!
So the Magic Regiments get off free?
What is the meaning behind this?
Atone for your sins.
In that case I'd rather be executed!
I refuse to live a life of humiliation!
That's right. Got it?
We were always prepared for the worst.
New King, this is our will.
I think you grasp it now, yes?
In that case...
In that case, let me atone for my sins as well!
In that case...
Coco, you acted based on your conscious.
Your actions were noble.
Regardless of your past, do not make nothing of them.
But...
Even without magic power, you people all have incredible latent powers.
Furthermore, you have knowledge and experience.
I want you to put them to work in restoring the Royal City.
If you think that to be difficult,
consider it the ultimate punishment you receive from me.
And what of his highness?
I mean, Faust... Wouldn't he be the same?
Why is he the only one that's banished?
That's right!
Enough already.
But...
Be well.
I am thankful for your lenient sentence, new King.
I called out to that youth when he left...
Yes, I noticed.
Solidarity.
Huh?
Courage.
Conviction.
It seems I had forgotten some important things...
Is being in a guild fun?
Yeah!
Is being in a guild fun?
When I asked that, I'll never forget the smile on that youth's face.
I don't know exactly why...
That is all.
Coco! Keep on running!
I will!
Man, what a breeze!
Quite peaceful, really...
Comfy...
Don't ride on the inside!
And don't have tea, damn it!
And just like that... Moving is over!
What's that?
They moved a building?
Wait, that mark... Could they be...?
Hey, everyone in the Royal City!
We're Fairy Tail!
We'll solve any problem you might have!
Our fee is fully negotiable!
In honor of our new opening, prices are super cheap!
Come on by!
Ooh, that'll be a big help!
The Great Demon Lord broke my roof! Can you repair it?
We don't got nearly enough brick-layers.
Someone help out!
We'd be happy to!
They're telling us to do things like fix the roof...
And baking bricks, too...
Witches...
Now, earn that cash!
She's too cruel...
On the other hand, here is Earthland's Fairy Tail.
And then...
S-Seriously?
Y-You're alive?!
Lisanna!
Don't you dare touch her with your filthy mitts!
That's the same reaction I had...
Yeah!
Oh, my...
Thank goodness. The guild's just like it was before.
I see. Looks like no one knows anything about the Anima.
Anyway, what's important is that everyone is safe.
This is messed up.
So, this is a wizard's guild...
Lisanna!
Master!
I believed...
Everyone raised in this guild is a child of this guild.
And what parent is there that doesn't worry about their child?
And what parent is there that doesn't believe in their child?
You can tell me all about what happened later.
You two, Natsu...
Sure, Gramps!
Anyway, you did great in coming home!
Master...
I am back home, aren't I?
I'm back home, right?
That's right. This will always be your home.
I'm home!
Ack! The Master!
Lisanna-san, please calm down!
Cry all you'd like... Before the party that is.
Anyone wanting seconds-kina?
Kinana-chan!
I'd like one over here!
Let's live it up together!
The guild's changed, too...
You seem a little different too, Mira-nee.
Do I?
But Fairy Tail is always Fairy Tail.
Lisanna.
This is a day to celebrate, Baby!
I really am glad you are safe.
The Raijinshuu! It's rare to see you in the guild.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
After all, I myself am...
Her hairstyle's changed!
*gloom*
So has her's!
Rain?
*gloom*
What's wrong with Juvia?
She seems down...
*gloom*
In Edolas, it's Gray that's in love with Juvia.
What?!
Maybe the hairstyle?
The you over there is...
Damn, just remembering it makes me...
Tell me already! My sake's gonna go bad.
Juvia wants to go to Edolas!
So that's it...
Me, too.
M-Me, too.
This guild's really the best!
So loud!
Stop making a scene, Natsu!
Was the Natsu over there like this?
My deepest apologizes-kina.
Well, about that.
I-I'm being bullied by Lucy-san!
He's like that.
What's with that? Hilarious!
I totally, totally wanna see that Natsu.
My muscles hurt from laughing!
What a hoot-kina!
I ain't some freak-show!
So cute!
Hey, Happy... Nice work there.
Aye!
So then, can you please pulverize the Dragon Slayers that are overly excited and running amok?
Once the party's over.
T-That conversation's pretty dark!
I ain't waitin' that long!
Let's fight right now!
Q-Quite a lively guild...
Everyone seems to get the same first impression.
That's what makes it fun!
And everyone here has magic power inside their body?
Incredible...
That's right. These are Earthland wizards.
Erza!
Oh yeah... In Edolas, you worked with Erza, yes?
And you're still together now.
But what's important isn't magic itself.
It's the heart of the person who uses it.
Isn't that right, Lily?
Even if you are a different person, seeing a familiar face puts me slightly more as easy.
Okay, Salamander, little girl!
Let's have a fight between my Lily, the blue cat, and the white cat!
Sounds good to me.
Looks like you've got the eye of a bigshot, there...
You'll be fine. Probably.
I've been waitin' for you to ask!
Well, I sure haven't.
Just so you know, my Lily is the strongest of the strong!
And Happy's the cattiest of the cats, so there!
Um, I'd lose in an instant.
Lame... What's with giving up before even trying?
S-She's expecting something from me?!
Enough. I may not look like it now, but I was a Regiment Commander in Edolas.
Useless fighting leads only to injury.
True...
You're quite mature.
Aren't they simply being childish?
Anyway, let's all get along, Happy, Carla...
Lily!
So? Why are the main people fighting?
Even Gray and Elfman are in the fray.
The fierce clash of naked body against naked body!
Juvia wants in!
Don't even think about it!
Sometimes cutting loose isn't such a bad idea.
That's how it is! Let in the fray, Natsu!
Everyone, calm down!
I knew it'd turn out like this.
Fairy Tail's gotta be like this.
By the way, Natsu...
How was the me over there?
The Edolas you, Gramps?
He was backwards, right? I'm curious...
Hmm, not sure...
Hold it...
I felt something like that... Somewhere...
I get it!
What is it?
Is being in a guild fun?
I think he might've been the king.
So what about me? How was the me over there?
Well...
Your name never came up, Gildarts...
He might've been a frog or a fish...
That's mean!
Natsu, what are you doing? This ain't a time for a nap!
Be a man about it!
To turn your back on a fight you started yourself,
what is the point of fight in the first...
For goodness sake...
Say, Gildarts...
Too bad about Mystogan...
But let's pray that he's doing well in Edolas.
He is.
He was raised in this guild.
Of course he's doing well.
Will you be staying in town for a little while, Gildarts?
Hmm, I'm not sure.
I have a little something to discuss...
What's this, then?
This is the newly reformed Magical Council.
Unacceptable!
Have you seen the mountain of apology letters?
Are those all from problems caused by a single guild?
Fairy Tail has been a thorn in our side since the previous generation...
It doesn't rise to the level you put it.
There's also the work they did in destroying Oracion Seis of the Baram Alliance.
Work, you say?
Master Org, what are you saying?
There is no record of the Magic Council authorizing that plan.
A number of local guilds took that initiative on thier own...
Strictly speaking, even if they are a dark guild,
that was still a violation of the prohibition between warring guilds!
And due to this incident, the Baram Alliance is sure to strike back against official guilds.
No, I do not think so.
They call themselves an alliance, but it's really just a non-aggression pact.
About Jellal, who was arrested in the Worth Woodsea...
And what's worse, I hear they are allies of this Jellel!
You have a dangerous idea...
Our Magic Council has been born anew!
We have to show the citizens what exactly is so new!
Chairman!
In order to take back the trust people once had in us,
we must keep a tight reign on this trouble guild.
Fairy Tail has no future!
Next, we'll force the guild to breakup!
This man is the new chairman of the Magic Council, Grandoma.
What's the matter, Org? Unsatisfied by something?
No...
You are still naive.
You should know this from your blunder letting a thought projection
trick you into using the R-system to cause a disaster.
Yes...
Call the two!
Yes, sir.
Lahall, Dranbalt, come here!
Everything for the Holy Order of the Magic Council!
The Holy Order of the Magic Council!
The Holy Order of the Magic Council!
I wonder how much everyone partied?
Isn't it nice, Mira-san? Elfman?
I hope Natsu can meeting Igneel soon, ton.
I wonder if Natsu feels lonely sometimes, too?
But he's pretty cute when he's sleeping.
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
You give up, Gray?
Is that how it is?
You can't come near me.
Don't. I'm not your enemy.
Is it no use?
Close to me...
I'm sorry.
It's not like I want to take anyone's life...
The world rejects me...
Natsu...
I want to meet you soon...
Huh? Where's my scarf?
It's above your bed.
And my vest?
It's drying outside.
My underwear?
You're wearing them, see?
Oh, I see!
Impressive as always, Happy.
Right, sure... Anyway, hurry and get changed.
You'll be late for your job.
You know what this is...
Next time: Best Partner!
Isn't that right, Happy?
I'm more your protector than your partner...
