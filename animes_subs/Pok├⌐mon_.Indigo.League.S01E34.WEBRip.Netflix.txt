With fond memories of the Safari Zone fresh in their minds,
our heroes continue on their journey.
Feels weird to be back in a city, huh, Misty?
Sure does.
Being out in the jungle was great,
but it's kind of nice to come back to civilization.
Hey, Pikachu, let's have a humongous meal when we get to the Pokemon Center.
Pi, pika! Pika!
I want a hot dog.
I want a deep-dish, extra-cheese pizza. Mm!
-Hey, what's that thing? -What thing?
-Let's go see! -Wait for us, Ash!
Wow! Look at that!
Pika!
That's an amazing bridge.
-So it's been completed already. -Huh?
Hey. The map says it's still under construction.
But if it's completed, we can go straight to Sunny Town on the opposite shore
without going all the way around.
Great! We'll cross the bridge and get to the next town.
Come on. Let's go!
Pika!
Well, I'm afraid the bridge isn't completely finished.
See there?
Huh?
That means we can't take the shortcut.
Even if it were finished, this bridge is only for cars anyway.
The bridge is only for cars?
Couldn't we just walk across it?
Well, this bridge is over ten miles long.
It'd be dark before you reached the other side.
Ten miles long?
Of course you might be able to cross if you had bicycles.
Bicycles!
- Hey, Norman! -Ride safely.
I thought you said the bridge isn't finished.
The road isn't finished, but the bicycle path is.
- Hi! -Hi, girls!
If you had bikes, you could cross too.
Wish we did.
- Well... -Oh!
If a certain someone here hadn't totally destroyed my bike,
we could be just zipping right across this bridge now, couldn't we?
Well, yeah. Maybe.
Hmm...
It's no use. We can't afford these.
Pika.
Let's go to the Pokemon Center and figure out a plan.
Sounds good to me.
I'll probably come up with a brilliant idea.
Well, what's your brilliant plan?
Will you be quiet? I'm still thinking of it.
Hm...
Excuse me, if you could spare some time, would you mind helping me out?
Huh?
Please let me help. I just love caring for Pokemon.
It's my life. Please.
Please, miss. Miss.
Uh, by the way, are you by any chance related to the Joy in Gringy City?
I'm her cousin.
Ah, but you're much, much prettier than she is.
That's just fine, but...
I'm worried about the Pokemon in Sunny Town,
just over the bridge, that's very sick.
-Oh. -Huh?
I need someone to deliver this medicine to the Pokemon Center in Sunny Town.
Normally I'd go myself, but I'm too busy with sick Pokemon
to leave the center right now.
-It's just over the bridge, right? -That's right.
But we don't have any bicycles.
No problem. I'll let you use some of our bicycles.
Huh?
-Huh? -Hey...
We'll do anything we can if it's to help a sick Pokemon.
Even if that means we'll have to zip across the bridge on bikes.
That's great.
The bikes are in the parking lot. And thank you.
Bye!
I'd be happy to stay here and help you if you need me.
Come on, Brock!
Hurry up, guys!
Brock, I'm doing all the pedaling.
Hmm.
Pika! Pika!
You see, we're getting to cross the bridge after all.
Right, Ash. We sure got lucky.
Pikachu!
They're riding on the bike path across the bridge.
You think we got a chance this time?
Well, it's not like this place is new to us, you know.
You could almost call it our hometown. Isn't that right, James?
So we'll have the home team advantage.
James, prepare to attack.
I'm a little busy here.
Ah!
This is a great workout.
Yeah, and since we lucked into those bikes,
it won't be long till we're in Sunny Town.
Right, Brock.
Ah!
Okay. Time to hit the road.
Huh?
Yeah!
Uh-oh. Who are they?
It's a bicycle gang.
Uh, a bicycle gang?
I think we better get out of here.
Yeah!
I don't think I've seen you before.
Uh, we're not really from around here, so see you.
Hold it!
You're ain't going to cross this bridge without a proper introduction.
- That's right. - Get them, boss.
Uh, hello.
It's a pleasure.
Very nice to meet you.
See you again sometime!
That's no introduction!
When we say introduction, we mean Pokemon battle.
A Pokemon battle?
All right. I accept.
I'd do anything for an introduction to a girl like you.
Would you go out with me?
Ooh!
Get lost, loser. I only care about my bike and my gang.
Is that a no?
All right.
Let's get started.
Then we'll see who's the master.
Huh. You think you can play with the big boys?
I'll send you home crying.
Golem, go!
Golem!
What's that?
Golem. A megaton Pokemon.
Once a year, it sheds its bedrock shell and grows larger.
Okay, then. I choose...
Bulbasaur!
Bulbasaur.
Bulbasaur. Vine whip.
Bulbasaur!
Your Pokemon needs more practice.
That wimpy vine whip attack is never going to get through Golem's shell.
All right, Golem. Tackle attack!
Golem!
Bulbasaur!
Golem!
Are you okay, Bulbasaur?
Bulbasaur.
Return, Bulbasaur.
Charmander, I choose you.
Char! Char!
Charmander. Ember!
Char! Char!
Heh! Trying to heat things up? It ain't going to happen.
Go, Golem! Rock throw now!
Golem! Go!
Char!
Charmander, flamethrower!
Char!
Charmander, fire spin now.
Char!
Golem!
Golem. Tackle attack now.
Golem!
-Char! -Charmander, run!
Golem, return.
Huh?
Now it's my turn to show you.
I choose you, Cloyster.
Crush this wimp!
Cloys!
Huh? What's a Cloyster?
Cloyster. A bivalve Pokemon.
Its shell is incredibly strong and resistant to a bomb.
Its shell only opens when it attacks.
-Okay, no sweat. -It's a water Pokemon.
-Just leave it to me. -Huh?
You battle?
This should be quick.
Which one would be best against Cloyster's hard shell?
I know.
Starmie, go!
Psy?
Huh? Psyduck, what are you doing here?
I wanted Starmie, not you.
Psy?
Well, now that you're out, give it a try.
Psy-i-i-i!
Psyduck. Psyduck. Psyduck...
Psyduck. Psyduck. Psyduck.
Psy? Psy?
I have never seen such a pathetic Pokemon.
Psy?
My gut hurts!
Psyduck, use your tail whip attack.
Psy.
Psy. Psy. Psy...
Huh?
Pika-pi.
Pikachu.
Psy. Psy. Psy. Psy. Psy. Psy.
Psy!
And we were supposed to be attacking.
Psyduck, scratch it now!
Psy!
Um, let'em laugh. Just wait till they see Psyduck's real power.
Psy...
Psyduck, use your disable attack.
Psy? Psy? Psy?
Oh, just attack, you dumb duck!
Go on and use your confusion attack.
Psy. psy...
Psy!
Ah. Can't you remember your own attacks?
Misty it's because its headache isn't bad enough yet.
Come on, Cloyster! Score a knockout!
Go for the head! Go for the head!
They're even starting to cheer for our side.
Cloyster, clamp it with your shell.
Cha?
Looks like this battle's over.
Psyduck needs help.
I'll have to give it a headache myself!
Don't do it, Misty!
- - Huh?
Looks like the next town wants to rumble.
Who is that?
Prepare for trouble.
Make it double.
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above...
-Jessie. -James.
Team Rocket. Blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Meowth. That's right.
Tyra, it's been awhile.
Big Jess!
You're looking good, Chopper.
Little Jim.
Big Jess and Little Jim? What's that about?
Huh! Well, nerd, we had a pretty bad reputation here back in the old days.
You were Chainer Jessie.
Big Jess was really cool,
swinging her chain around while she rode her bicycle.
And then there was Trainer James.?
Little Jim was the only one in the bike gang
who had to use training wheels.
I suppose we really were crazy back then.
Well, I guess our secret past isn't secret anymore.
I kind of wish it still was a secret.
Pika.
But I see you're still into kid stuff, riding around on bicycles.
Real gangs ride unicycles.
I guess your cycle gang must save a ton of money on handlebars.
Tyra, we're not in a gang.
We are members of the famous Team Rocket!
Team Rocket!
And I'd like to have all of you help us to take care of these little pests
that are always ruining our plans.
I'll do anything for Jess and Jim.
Then capture all of their Pokemon.
-Let's go! -Come on!
Hey, who's causing all the trouble on this bike path?
The cops. Let's split!
I thought you were going to help us.
They're all a bunch of scaredy-cats.
I'm getting kind of scared myself.
Uh-huh.
So you're just trying to deliver Pokemon medicine to Sunny Town?
Right, Joy, the beautiful Pokemon Center nurse sent us.
Of course, she can't compare with you, Officer Jenny.
You need to get there, so I'll give you an escort.
Huh?
This is 303.
Roger. Over and out.
There's been an accident. I'll have to go.
That's okay. We'll be fine.
Be careful.
-Okay. -Thanks.
We should get moving, Ash. A sick Pokemon's counting on us.
Let's go.
- Ah! -Pika!
Pikachu! We better hurry!
Pikachu.
They're riding right through the storm.
-No kidding. -I knew those kids were all wet.
That wind could blow'em right off of the bridge.
They must be insane. I'm glad we're inside.
- Big Jess. - Little Jim.
Hm?
We know you want to be out there. You could ride a storm twice this intense.
I could?
Big Jess, lead us into the eye of the storm
and show us how to ride Big Jess style.
Show the whole gang how to really ride.
You're not scared of this storm, are you?
I'm not. I just wish I had my training wheels with me.
What about you, Big Jess?
I guess I have no choice.
All right, now I'll show you kids what riding's all about.
I wish I could go with you.
Meowth, we'd never leave you behind.
The medicine still hasn't arrived.
But they should be there by this time.
Maybe they won't get through the storm.
Ah!
What's that?
A drawbridge. That ship's trying to take shelter in the bay.
-What do we do? -We'll have to wait till it gets through.
We can't wait. They need that medicine.
Oh, I wish we were out of this rain.
Hey, look there.
How you going to get past that?
Hang in there, Little Jim.
Show us all what you can do, Big Jess.
-Do we really have to do this? -I guess so.
-Ash, don't! -There's a sick Pokemon waiting.
I can't let it down.
Ash, wait up!
Just have to keep going for that sick Pokemon.
I have to make it. I just have to.
Ah!
Oh, no. They're not going to make it.
Ah!
We'll drown!
-We'll bounce! -
We made it!
They did it! They're awesome!
Team Rocket's splashing down again!
All right. Now you have to battle us.
I'm delivering medicine for a sick Pokemon.
-Out of my way. -What?
You mean that's why you're out in this storm?
That's right.
Unbelievable. That's a real biker for you.
Listen up, guys! We're going to take them there in style.
Don't worry, Ash. We'll clear the way for you.
Huh?
Here, Nurse Joy.
You made it through in a storm like this.
Now this little one will be just fine.
All right!
Sorry for making you worry about us. We made it just in time.
That's great. Thank you.
From now on, we're calling you Awesome Ash.
Mighty Misty.
Well, gosh, I'm not really that awesome.
You could call me honey.
Argh!
And so our brave friends finally saved the sick Pokemon
and made it through the storm to Sunny Town.
The bike gang has some new heroes and everyone is happy.
Well, not everyone.
This is a vicious cycle.
Okay, guys we going to rap some Pokemon.
You just do the singing, I'll take care of the hard part.
