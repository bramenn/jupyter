Who are you?
Like you, I despise Inuyasha.
Tell me your name.
It is Naruku.
I'm not afraid!
Naraku is an awful demon! We must destroy him!
Trying to gain time?!
I was scared.
What're you doing, Inuyasha?!
Shut up!
If you destroy the well, Kagome won't be able to return!
Don't you care if you never see her again?!
When she's around, I can't fight the way I want.
Let's go, Miroku.
Where to?
Isn't it obvious?
To find Naraku and beat the hell out of him!
Well, Shippo?
Forget it! I hate Inuyasha!
Awright! Please yourself!
I think you were a bit too rough.
Although I understand that you don't want her to get hurt.
If you understand, shut up!
So you're going to look for Naraku...
but how will you find him? You have any ideas?
Well...
You don't?
Shaddup!
You sent her back.
Just because Kagome isn't here now, don't take it out on me!
You!
Oh well... Let's just calm down and think things through!
We don't have the time!
I, too!
I, too, want to find him quickly and slay him with these hands!
Fifty years ago, he opened the Wind Tunnel in my grandfather's hand.
The curse has carried over generation after generation to me!
Miroku...
I'm not good at thinking. You think of something.
These things must be taken in order.
Inuyasha, you said you fell into Naraku's trap 50 years ago...
in this village.
Yeah.
So you've met Naraku then?
Well...
Inuyasha, you can become a mortal.
If you use the Sacred Jewel.
Tomorrow at dawn, right here...
I will bring the Sacred Jewel.
Die, Inuyasha!
Even if I met him, he was disguised as Kikyo.
I don't know what he looks like.
That's the strange part.
You don't know Naraku...
yet he disguised himself as Kikyo and shot an arrow at you.
Did you do something that embittered him?
I've never seen his face! How would I know?!
In any case, Kikyo was a priestess.
It could be that Naraku...
had something to do with Kikyo rather than you.
Kikyo and Naraku?!
Kagome!
It's been so long! Is your rheumatism better?
Not! She had beriberi!
Huh? You're not in uniform. What happened?
My uniform was dirty... with blood all over.
Huh?! Now it's hemorrhaging?!
My illness is going from bad to worse.
Inuyasha's bleeding hadn't stopped.
I was so worried for him...
When he embraced me...
I'll hold onto this!
What if he did that on purpose to get the Sacred Jewel?
If so, I'll never forgive him!
Higurashi...
Go stand in the hallway.
I had never been held like that by a boy...
I guess he passes for a boy. Since he's half-human.
Inuyasha, with these injuries, you won't be able to fight for a while.
Shaddup! It'll be better in a few days.
Well, I'm done.
What're you doing?!
With that kind of energy, you may recover quickly.
But I've been thinking...
ever since that time my sister Kikyo was resurrected from mud.
My sister said that her Sacred Jewel was stolen by you.
Don't you think it strange?
This man who disguised himself as you...
Why, he could have made his escape with the Jewel.
Yet...
He tricked you into terrorizing the village...
and going after the Sacred Jewel.
And then...
Kikyo sealed you to the tree.
Did he want to make you despise each other?
Or was he trying to fill Kikyo's heart with hate and bitterness?
What?
In Kikyo's possession, the Sacred Jewel remained pure.
But when her heart became unclean and hateful...
the Jewel also became unclean and filled with evil strength.
And at that time, only one person would have hoped for that.
Do you want to go there... where this man lived?
My sister had decided so...
But she harbored a thief?
Because he was unable to move at all.
He called himself Onigumo.
He had terrible burn scars over his entire body.
His face, especially, was badly burned.
He probably fell from a cliff...
both his legs were broken.
Still, Onigumo lived.
He was unable to move...
but he slowly healed and was able to speak.
However...
His true self...
Hey kid...
I'm Kaede.
Your sister has something called the Sacred Jewel.
How do you know about that?
All bad men are after it.
You, too?
I understand that the more evil this Jewel absorbs...
the more evil it becomes.
How nice...
My sister has it under control. It will not go bad.
Kikyo is always so smug.
I'd like to see her worried and scared.
Now that would give me a rush.
I see...
So Onigumo said that?
Sister, I don't like him.
Forgive him.
He will probably never be able to move from there.
Shortly thereafter...
Sister sealed you to the tree and died.
Several days later when I went there...
the cave was burned down.
The flames must have been huge...
Onigumo was unable to escape...
and perished... leaving no bones... not a sign.
Or so I thought.
C'mon, Old Woman! Wasn't he human?
The Naraku I seek is a demon!
Absolutely.
No matter how weak and evil, he was still human.
No mistake about that.
Shall we go inside this cave?
It won't budge!
Unless the well is fixed, Kagome can't return.
Will I ever see her again?
When she's around, I can't fight the way I want!
He's so willful!
I'll never speak to Inuyasha ever again!
Inuyasha?
Did you say Inuyasha?
Priestess Kaede, what is this?
No grass... not even moss grows on this one spot.
This is where the paralyzed Onigumo rested!
I feel the spirit of a demon!
The spirit which was left here decades ago!
What?!
Can it be that the one who left the evil here...
so that no grass grows...
is actually human?
No, it's not human. It's from a demon!
How can a human like Onigumo...
possess such evil as would belong to a demon?
Help!
Inuyasha!
Shippo!
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!
Inuyasha!
Inuyasha... blood!
Damn! My wound has reopened!
Are you Inuyasha?
Who are you?!
I am the guardian of Hell, Royakan!
Royakan? Are you the demon that guards that forest?
I am reborn!
Inuyasha, I come to kill you!
Kill me?!
He knows that Inuyasha is in no condition to fight.
It's useless to fight me!
There's only one thing to use here!
Inuyasha, come over this way!
No way!
What a brilliant idea it was...
to imbed a Sacred Jewel fragment in Royakan.
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!
Inuyasha!
My vision's getting blurry...
Monk, Inuyasha's in danger!
Yes... There's only one way...
If I can swallow up Royakan!
We can win!
He escaped...
I should've made Royakan a bit stronger.
Are you all right, Inuyasha?
Where's Royakan?
He escaped.
Inuyasha, Naraku is near.
What?!
Royakan is probably under control...
by Naraku, who has a Sacred Jewel fragment.
No wonder such a gentle demon like Royakan...
has turned so evil.
Naraku! Where are you?!
If you're here, come out and fight!
Inuyasha!
Monk, Royakan may come again.
We should return to the village.
Inuyasha!
It's been three days. Why doesn't he come for me?
Kagome!
Hojo from Group E wants to talk to you.
Higurashi, how've you been feeling these days?
I'm okay.
Really? Then will you go to the movies with me on Saturday?
On Saturday?
Yeah.
It'll be a nice change from studying.
Or do you have other plans?
Plans... err...
Inuyasha might've come for me by then...
Go, Kagome.
You already stood him up once.
- How'd you know?! - How'd you know?!
- Excuse us. - Give us a moment.
What?
Do you have someone else you like?
You're always sighing.
It's not the look of one who's worried about school.
Well, that's...
After he hugged me like that...
I'll bet it's unrequited love!
W-what?
Are you kidding?!
Who'd like a selfish and rough guy like that!
- Who's she talking about? - Well...
Hojo! I'll go to the movies with you.
Really? Yes!
Besides, why should I be manipulated by that stubborn Inuyasha!?
Didn't work.
I wonder what Inuyasha is doing now.
Open! Open!
Open up!
It's useless, Inuyasha.
This hut is plastered with charms to keep demons out.
Why must I be sealed in?!
Open!
Please Inuyasha. Be still and rest.
Your wound isn't healed yet.
Kagome!
Eh-heh-heh... Would you like me to sleep with you?
Shippo... Why you!
Don't you dare disguise yourself like that again?!
Don't get so mad?!!
Inuyasha, are you still banging around?
Miroku! You!
Charms are no use if you act like this.
Lemme outta here!
Priestess Kaede, please seal the door with the charm.
All right.
You're not ready yet.
I know how eager you are...
but first, the wound must heal completely.
He's right.
You can't underestimate that Naraku.
Isn't that why you made Kagome go through the well?
Inuyasha... So that's why you sent her away.
I don't want to die in vain.
And that's why...
I need you to get well quickly.
Stop talking like a weakling!
I'm ready to fight anytime!
Inuyasha, just stay still and get some sleep.
How many times must I repeat myself?!
You dog!
Hey! His wound will reopen.
Say, Inuyasha...
What is it?
I wonder how Kagome is doing?
Not again! Look, just forget about Kagome already.
As long as she's alive and well somewhere, that's all.
I don't want to see anymore women I know die.
I looked for you, Royakan.
Naraku!
Go back! I refuse to fight Inuyasha again!
You're trembling.
I don't want to be sucked into the Wind Tunnel.
Just go away!
I will take away the fear that is making you tremble.
S-stop!
A sinister wind...
Priestess Kaede, take care. It's coming.
Yes.
He will not take a step further!
Inuyasha! Where are you?!
What happened?! He's grown much bigger!
Where are you, Inuyasha!
As long as our spell is active...
that hut where Inuyasha lies will be invisible!
But what has happened to this demon? He's different.
I'll wager another Sacred Jewel fragment has been imbedded in him.
Such a pitiful defense.
Priestess Kaede!
Don't move!
I must!
I can see you now!
Inuyasha, there you are!
- Inuyasha! - Inuyasha!
Thanks for releasing me, Royakan.
That old hag and monk had me sealed up.
We were protecting him!
Such an ingrate!
Die quietly!
Shaddup!
Inuyasha's been thrown!
Inuyasha's all talk... His strength isn't back yet.
How'd he get so strong?!
It's a giant fragment of Sacred Jewel.
Damn!
You can't have'em!
Shippo!
You won't get away!
Shippo! I'll take over.
I'll use my Wind Tunnel!
That's!
Naraku's poison bugs!
Damn!
What'll I do?!
50 years ago, Inuyasha and Kikyo were...
tricked into hating and killing each other.
It was all engineered by a demon, Naraku.
Why did he do it? What was his purpose?
What is his true identity?
Inuyasha's fury and love for Kikyo...
cut through the evil and corner Naraku.
Next, Inuyasha: Naraku's True Identity Revealed.
Look forward to it!
