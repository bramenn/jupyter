It's okay.
Bell-kun is alive.
The blessing I gave him hasn't disappeared.
Burn, dark magics!
Will o' Wisp!
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Under Resort Labyrinth Utopia
They're so strong...
The monsters were wiped out instantly.
Incredible.
Let's go.
Asfi Al Andromeda...
One of our generation's greatest item makers.
Her title is The Omnipotent Perseus.
And her...
She's like the wind.
What's this?
A cave-in, huh?
Th-This is Bell-kun's...
They're not here anymore.
They lost most of their equipment here, and suffered casualties, too.
I doubt they're wandering around the dungeon anymore.
A party that stupid would've already been
wiped out a long time ago.
Which means...
The most likely possibility...
and are heading down toward the safe zone on the Eighteenth Floor. Right?
There are many holes in the dungeon's floors.
It's far easier to go down than up.
But still... go down?
That's insane.
That's what I'd do.
And they would, too.
No...
Now that he's survived a true adventure, he'll keep going forward.
I agree with her completely.
Me, too. Bell-kun is below.
I've got that feeling.
Then it's decided.
Let's head for Floor 18.
Please be safe,
Bell-kun!
Welf! Welf!
Mind down?
Lili, Welf is...
Lili!
So would you explain this already, Hermes?
Why do you want to save Bell-kun?
I told you!
I'm going to help my dear frie
Enough of that.
Someone asked me to take a look at Bell-kun's progress.
Someone?
But I didn't come all the way down here
just because someone asked.
I'm interested in Bell-kun.
I want to see for myself, Hestia,
if he's capable of bringing us into a new era.
Gotta get there... soon...
This is...
If you mean the Goliath,
the Loki Familia should have beaten it on their way down.
Given the time it takes to respawn,
if we go now, we'll get through first.
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run!
Lili...
Welf...
Goddess...
Save my friends.
Please...
My friends...
Lili! Welf!
Are you okay?
How do you feel?
Aiz-san?
Wh-What are you doing here?
Our Familia is heading back from our expedition,
so we stopped here on the Eighteenth Floor.
Eighteenth Floor...
Where are my friends?
Welf... Lili...
They'll be fine.
Riveria and the others healed them.
You were badly wounded, too.
Thank you for saving me. I really mean that...
Can you move?
Y-Yes.
I'm supposed to tell our leader when you wake up.
Come with me.
You made it to the Eighteenth Floor on your first trip to the middle floors, huh?
You did well to escape from the floor boss!
No, I...
I think I just got lucky.
Thank you for saving me!
I understand the situation.
Thank you for doing so much for us.
If I left one of Aiz's acquaintance to die,
she'd never forgive me.
A monster poisoned some of our comrades with a particularly nasty venom.
Our swiftest members are going to the surface to fetch an antidote.
We plan to stay here until the medicine arrives.
It's really him! The Argonaut!
Hey there, Aiz.
Tiona. Tione.
You woke up!
I'm so glad, Argonaut-kun!
Um... Argonaut?
Don't worry about it.
It's just what this dummy likes to call you.
We saw you fight that Minotaur!
It reminded me of this great old fairy tale!
You were amazing!
If you're in the middle floors, that means you reached Level 2, right?
And the way you beat that Minotaur...
You're good!
Um...
He's blushing!
So cute!
Well, this is... well...
What's wrong?
Um... Well, this is a dungeon, right?
Where's this light coming from?
Wow!
Is that...
Yeah.
It's all crystal.
As time passes, the light will fade and night will begin.
That's why adventurers call this the labyrinth utopia, Under Resort.
It really did get dark.
Where are we?
Bell-sama?
Lili!
Welf!
Are you okay?
Do you recognize me?
I could never forget who you are, Bell-sama.
Yeah... if I can hear Li'l Lili prattling on, it means I'm fine.
I'm sorry, Bell-sama.
We really did slow you down.
I'm sorry.
That's not true!
If it weren't for you, Lili, I never would have thought to go to the Eighteenth floor.
And if it weren't for Welf, the Hellhounds would've barbecued us!
That was all thanks to you two. Because our whole party was there,
we were able to survive all that.
You're right.
We couldn't have done it without everyone, right?
Dinner's ready.
Are you okay?
Th-The Sword Princess!
Aiz Wallenstein!
They are brave adventurers who risked their lives for each other.
As fellow adventurers, please treat them with respect.
Here.
Um...
What's this?
A fruit from the Eighteenth floor.
Fruit from the dungeon?
So sweet!
Bell-sama! Bell-sama!
If you don't like it, I'll take it.
Here.
This is too sweet, yeah.
Argonaut-kun!
Hey, hey, how can I get S ranked in my abilities?
Tell us all about it!
Why you...
Damn it! Nobody told me about that huge thing!
Goddess!
Bell-kun!
Bell-kun! Bell-kun!
Bell-kun! Bell-kun! Bell-kun!
Goddess!
Bell-kun!
Is it really you?
Goddess...
I'm so glad.
Goddess?
I'm sorry I worried you.
Enough already, Hestia-sama!
Hey!
Don't ruin my moving reunion scene!
Bell-sama got hurt protecting us, and he needs to rest!
Wallenwhatsit?!
Why are you here, too?
Cranel-san.
You're safe?
R-Ryu-san?
So you're Bell Cranel?
Yes!
I see. So you're it, huh?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
My name is Hermes.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Don't worry. I'm just doing this for my dear friend Hestia.
And if you're going to thank somebody, thank these children, not me.
It's thanks to them that we made it here.
I'm so sorry!
No, please don't...
No matter how much you apologize, it won't be easy to forgive you.
We almost died.
Yeah.
We can't just let it go.
I'm really sorry.
You're right to be angry.
If you need to take it out on me
Blame me, if you've got to blame somebody.
It was my order.
And I still think it was the right thing to do.
I'm amazed you can say that right in front of us, big guy.
No, he's right.
Lili, Welf...
If your lives were on the line,
I might have done the same thing.
If you say so, Bell-sama.
I'll get over this.
But I am never going to be okay with it.
Right. That's as it should be.
Okay, let's talk about what comes next.
Asfi.
First, as for our return to the surface,
we'll leave after the Loki Familia defeats the Goliath.
It's going to be at least two days before they move.
In other words, you've all got a day off.
Why not take a break and rest tomorrow?
Goodnight, Bell-sama!
Yeah. Goodnight.
Welf-kun.
Hephaestus wanted me to give this to you.
I have a message for you, too.
I still can't believe this is in the dungeon.
What's wrong?
Oh, well...
I couldn't sleep.
Um, what are you doing here, Aiz-san?
I saw you walking.
And... I was a little worried.
Am I bothering you?
No, that's not what I meant!
I'm so happy
No!
You're always nervous, aren't you, Bell?
When do you leave?
Well... after you do.
So we're going to rest tomorrow.
I see.
So are you going to see the town?
There's a town in the dungeon?
Want to go tomorrow?
Sure!
A town, huh?
I wonder what it's like!
A town, huh?
Come on, Bell-kun.
If you're going, you need to invite me first!
Me and you, Bell-kun...
We're inseparable, right?!
I-I'm sorry!
So that's how it is, Wallenwhatsit!
You won't run off with him without my permission!
And I'll never let you go on a date with him!
A date?
N-No!
You misunderstand, Goddess!
You're going on a date, Bell-sama?!
Butt out, thief!
I will never make another magic item.
I see.
For now, that's fine.
But if you ever want to devote your life to something greater,
you'll regret throwing that power away.
Don't make yourself weigh your pride against your friends.
Damn it!
