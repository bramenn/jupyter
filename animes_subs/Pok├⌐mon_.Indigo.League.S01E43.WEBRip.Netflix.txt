Ash and his friends find themselves in beautiful Grandpa Canyon.
Our heroes will soon discover that this natural wonder holds an ancient secret.
Whats going on down there?
I wonder what everybodys doing with those picks and shovels.
- Dont you know anything? -Huh?
Ash, not only late as usual, but clueless too.
Hey, its Gary. Uh, why are you dressed like that?
Huh. Dont tell me you never heard about the Pokemon discovery.
Even a nerd like you should have heard about the great fossil rush.
The great fossil rush?
Gary, Gary hes our man! If he cant find them, no one can!
Thank you. Thank you to all my loyal fans.
I got to go. I got to find all the fossils quick before anyone else does.
Cant waste my precious time hanging around with a loser like you.
-Loser? -Easy.
-Ash? -That know-it-all. Ah!
Im going to find a Pokemon fossil before Gary even starts digging.
Thatll show him who the real loser is.
I dont feel right about digging up old Pokemon fossils,
especially after theyve been resting in the earth for such a long time.
If theyve been lying underground for thousands of years,
maybe theyd like a little fresh air, heh.
I think its your brain that needs fresh air.
-Who asked you? -Jigglypuff.
Puff, puff, Jigglypuff. Puff, puff.
Puff!
Success. My first Pokemon fossil.
Yay. Gary, Gary, hes the best. Found a fossil before the rest.
Go, Gary.
Hmm.
Impressive, isnt it? Found it on my first try.
Looks like a brain from an extinct Pokemon.
- This is- -A brain?
-Its fossilized Pokemon manure. -Huh?
Ew, yuck. Gross.
Wow. Look at all the people digging.
Pika.
We'd better hurry before all the fossils are dug up.
All these people digging but nobodys found any fossils yet.
I wonder if this great fossil rush is really for real.
Sure it is.
- Whats taking those two so long? - Huh?
Humans. The only thing you can depend on is that theyre always undependable.
Ta-da.
-Prepare for trouble. -Yes, and make it double.
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie. -James.
Team Rocket. Blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to...
-Oh! -
Cut the poetry. I bet you two clowns didnt even plant the dynamite
-like you were supposed to. -Wrong again, fur ball.
Of course we planted the dynamite.
Once we blast Grandpa Canyon to smithereens,
well be able to scoop up all those Poke fossils.
Next time, Ill make fossils out of you.
Did you hear that? Theyre going to blow up this whole canyon.
All the people who are digging here are going to get caught in the blast.
Pikachu and I will stop them. You two, spread the word to run for it.
-Theres no time to lose. -Lets go.
Pretty soon, well have all the Pokemon fossils to ourselves.
-Hold it right there. -Oh, its that pest again.
-Always messing up our plans. -But this time, youre too late.
The fuse is already lit.
Whoa. I got to stop'em! Squirtle, I choose you.
Squirtle, squirt.
Theres no time to lose. Squirtle, squirt out that fuse.
Squirtle!
Squirtle!
Squirtle, after it.
- -Pika!
-Arbok, go. -Go, Weezing. Keep that fuse lit.
Weezing!
-You can do it, Squirtle. -Ah, stop that twerp.
Keep squirting.
- Quickly. - Dont let it hit the fuse.
- Come on. Theyre getting away. - Hurry, you slowpokes.
- We got to put it out somehow. - Youre running like slugs.
-Faster, Arbok. Theres not much time. -Hurry up, Weezing.
Weezing, sludge attack now.
Were not going to get it.
Oh!
-Oh, look out. -Pika.
No. The dynamite.
Pikachu!
Squirtle.
-Ash. -Pikachu.
-Squirtle. Squirtle. -What a disaster.
- Weve got to get them out. -Hmm, lets go.
Jigglypuff?
Jigglypuff.
Where are we?
Looks like we got blown all the way to the moon.
Or down to the center of the earth.
This is a cave. The dynamite must have blown a hole in the roof and we fell in.
We must be buried deep under the earths crust.
Buried?
This is all your fault, you twerp.
If you hadnt tried to put out that fuse, we never would have fallen down here.
Hey, youre the crooks who planted all that dynamite up there in the first place.
Pikachu.
What difference does it make who got us down here?
All that matters is getting out of here in one piece. Look up there.
The roof of the cave is blocked.
Hmm, heh.
James, it sounds like you have an answer to our problem.
-Hmm? Were all doomed. -Huh?
-Thats not the answer I wanted to hear. -Ugh.
-There must be some way out. -Chu.
-Pi? -Whats up, Pikachu?
-Pika, pika. -Huh?
- -I dont think were in here alone.
What are they?
Lets see.
Omanyte and Omastar. Kabuto and Kabutops.
It is believed that these Pokemon became extinct tens of thousands of years ago.
The details of their behavior is shrouded in mystery.
Though some have speculated that they may still exist,
none of these Pokemon have ever been seen alive.
Were going to be rich.
Well open a prehistoric Pokemon park thatll be bigger than Pokeworld.
Even the boss will be impressed with us.
Ah, I could get my own talk show or even my own cartoon.
Those Pokemon dont seem as happy about this as you guys do.
Chu.
Just look at those eyes. These Pokemon seem really angry.
They look like they just woke up.
Maybe these Pokemon werent fossilized but were just sleeping.
Thats it. The dynamite must have woken them up after thousands of years.
Some alarm clock.
Ugh. Never mind. Lets just capture them.
Poke Ball, go.
-Kabutops! -
-They have us trapped. -Theres no place to run.
We have to battle. Charmeleon, I choose you.
Char.
Charmeleon, use your flame to stop them.
Ah, it still wont obey me.
Kabutops!
Kabutops!
Team Rocket blew the canyon up with dynamite.
Ash must be trapped down under these boulders. Youve got to help us.
The bulldozers cant make it down here. Well have to dig by hand.
Ill go and get some help.
Go, Geodude.
Geo.
Geodude, help us move this pile of rocks.
Listen, Ash, you better hold on. Dont forget you still owe me a new bike.
Arbok. Weezing. What are you doing? Why are you running away from them?
-You have to chase them. -
Go on, Pikachu. Give them your electric shock.
Pikachu!
Pika, pika!
Ah, electricity isnt going to work. Charmeleon.
Aw, its useless.
I dont understand what happened.
-A miracle. This is a miracle. -Were alive.
Oh, no, I hear something else.
Aerodactyl, an extinct flying Pokemon.
Its hard fangs suggest that it was a carnivore.
Its sharp claws were probably used to capture prey.
-Whats a carnivore? -That means it thinks were dinner.
-That must be why the others ran away. -I hope it dont like cat food.
Charmeleon.
Looks like Charmeleons finally ready to fight.
-Good luck. -Char.
A first-round knockout.
- Ash. - Hey, Ash.
Get us out of here. And hurry up.
- Over here. - Hurry up.
Lets go.
-Charmeleon. -Pikachu.
-Pikachu, where did Ash go? -Pika.
-Watch out. -Watch out.
Jigglypuff. Huh?
Jigglypuff. Jiggly, jiggly, jigglypuff.
-Hey, theres Jigglypuff. -I wonder what its doing here.
-Oh, I get it. -What?
Jigglypuff.
It wants to sing. Ill get Jigglypuff to sing to Aerodactyl.
Great idea.
Jigglypuff, if you help us out now,
later, well listen to your song as much as you want.
Jigglypuff, heh.
Somebody get me down.
Pika!
Whoa. Charizard.
-Amazing. -It evolved into Charizard.
Aero!
Huh?
Charizard.
Charizard, you evolved because you wanted to rescue me when I got into trouble.
I thought you didnt want me as your trainer but now I see I was wrong.
I was right.
Looks like the only reason Charizard evolved was to battle Aerodactyl.
Pika, pi.
Careful, Ash.
Pretty soon, Ash is going to be too overcooked for Aerodactyl to eat.
Please, Jigglypuff, sing us your slumber song.
Jiggly.
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff, Jiggly... J
Hey, stay awake, Aerodactyl. If you fall asleep, well both...
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
Jigglypuff, puff! Puff!
Jigglypuff.
Some of you are claiming that you saw a prehistoric Pokemon here in the canyon.
That is ridiculous.
Let me assure you, it was only a dream caused by Jigglypuffs song.
I must also announce that due to the danger of further cave collapses,
no more digging will be permitted.
Hmm. That Aerodactyl sure didnt seem like a dream.
Gary dreams the best. Better than the rest.
Hes the best from east to west.
I guess theyre right.
-Whered Jigglypuff go? -Were you hoping for an encore?
Well, at least it deserved to take a bow.
Jigglypuff and Charizard really saved the day this time.
That Aerodactyl is one of a kind. Its too bad you couldnt capture it, Ash.
But I think Aerodactyl and the others would be happier just going back to sleep.
-Maybe youre right. - Hey, I almost forgot.
- Huh? -I found this when I woke up.
Huh?
Are you sure its all right for you to just take that?
What do you mean? Do you think I should have left it with Joy?
-Ugh, okay, Ash, Ill raise it for you. -But I could raise it myself.
You would have dropped it and broken it anyway.
I would not.
Dont worry, Ash. Ill take good care of it.
Hey, wait up! Give it back. Finders keepers!
And so our heroes leave Grandpa Canyon,
resting place of the ancient Pokemon, with a souvenir.
Hm. Maybe they should have just bought the T-shirts.
Meanwhile, another group of tourists is still enjoying the sights.
-Hey, up there, somebody help us. -We dont want to be extinct too.
- Ah. -Shh. Youre going to wake it up.
Rockaby, dactyl please dont eat us
Okay, guys, we gotta rap some Pokemon.
You just do the singing. I'll take care of the hard part.
