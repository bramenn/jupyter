Ehehehe.
Ehehehe.
Ehehehe.
Ehehehe! ! Ehehehe!
Ehehehe!
Ehehehe!
Ehehehe.
Hm?
Hm?
Ow!
That flat-chest...
Flat-chest, flat-chest, flat-chest.
Oh yeah? What about your chest?
Yes, your chest?
N-No, ma'am.
Oh, I'm just talking to myself.
You serious?
He doesn't quit.
The more damage he takes, the stronger he gets!
Ranta, I'm counting on you.
Don't die, Haruhiro, you idiot!
Oh yeah.
I have to keep fighting in a situation like this?
You're ruthless, Ranta.
No, he's moving really slowly.
What happened to Death Spots?
You're amazing, Moguzo.
Like Cleaver 1 or something.
Took long enough.
What's that supposed to mean?
I just couldn't accept Manato's death at that time yet.
Well, there was something I wanted to ask you.
What is it?
I taste bad.
WhatI guess they're pretty friendly.
Is it because I'm a Dark Knight?
That stinks!
O Darkness, master of Vices,
Daemon Call.
Wimpy Ranta.
Wimpy wooly caterpillar.
Caterpillar, caterpillar, caterpillar!
Caterpillar, caterpillar, caterpillar!
Caterpillar, caterpillar, caterpillar, caterpillar!
Caterpillar, caterpillar, caterpillar, caterpillar, caterpillar!
You're only calling me a caterpillar now.
Hey, Zodiaco.
I really need to get out of this mine.
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way.
Die, die, die.
Die, just die.
I'm already half dead...
Just die.
Die and be in Skullhell-sama's embrace.
Be embraced.
Caterpillar, caterpillar, caterpillar, caterpillar!
Caterpillar, caterpillar, caterpillar!
So I'm a caterpillar after all?
O light, return to Lumiaris' divine protection. Cure!
Let's go over our priorities again.
Our top priority is for all five of us to get back alive.
Next is rescuing Ranta.
Yes, we'll do as much as we can, but we can't be reckless.
Um, you probably know that I don't like Ranta.
It hurts my feelings when he calls me flat-chested, and he doesn't stop even when I tell him to.
It's hard to like someone like that, even if you asked me to try.
But, if I were all alone in this mine, I'd be really scared, you know?
And when I think about how Ranta must be feeling right now...
Don't worry.
If he would die from something like this, he would have died many times by now.
Let's go.
Ranta's waiting.
Vice, Vice, Vice, Vice, Vice, Vice, Vice!
Not the time to think about Vices!
Oh no!
Ranta?!
He's the only it could be.
Over there!
He got up here after being surrounded like that?
It's pretty amazing if he did.
His strength to live is stronger than most, to say the least.
The rest of us don't have that kind of tenacity to live.
Stay alive, Ranta.
Die! Die, die, die!
Die, die, die, die!
Die, Ranta!
Ranta, die!
Die, die, die!
Flat-chest...
Flat-chest, flat-chest, flat-chest, flat-chest, flat-chest, flat-chest!
I should have fondled her flat chest!
Exhaust!
Ranta!
Ranta!
Don't just call out to someone so suddenly.
You almost gave me a heart attack, idiot!
Thanks!
Marque, Em, Parc!
O light, return to Lumiaris' divine protection. Heal!
Haru-kun!
This is my last arrow!
This way, everybody!
You too, Yume!
Can you run, Ranta?
Of course I can.
Who do you think you're talking to, scum.
Shihoru!
Marque, Em, Parc!
O light, return to Lumiaris' divine protection. Cure!
Oh-ho?
Ranta, are you crying?
I'm not crying!
Your eyes are all watery, though.
I'm hurting all over!
You don't have to get so mad.
We were able to see you alive again.
I wanted to see you guys again!
N-No, that's not it.
No way I wanted to see you again.
Wh-When I thought I would never see all your pretty little faces again, my chest
What about your chest?
Did your chest feel tight?
N-No!
Your cheeest?
M-My chest!
Oh?
Chest...
Y-o-u-r cheeest?
Shut up, you flat-chest!
Don't call me that.
I will, and I'll say it million times!
Flat-chest, flat-chest, flat-chest!
Flat-chest, flat-chest, flat-chest, flatchest,flatchest,flatchest
Hey.
Be quiet and stay still.
Do you want me to stop healing you?
N-No.
I'm very sorry. Okay.
Hey!
It looks clear.
Let's go back to Ortana.
What a relief.
It's been a long day, huh...
It's not over yet.
Don't let your guard down until we get back to Ortana.
I was thinking about what Ranta meant when he said, Aren't you our leader?
Because to me, Manato was our leader.
And to be honest, there was something inside me that thought I had to become like Manato, but...
I'm not Manato.
Ah, no, it's nothing.
Manato said that everyone has strengths and weaknesses...
As for me, I have a lot of things that I'm not good at and that I need to work on.
My comrades make up for those weaknesses by helping me out,
and maybe that's how we've found a balance in our party.
That's why I don't know if I'm actually being a proper leader.
But if things are running smoothly, that's probably the most important thing.
Like for Ranta and me, if we can work well during a fight, it's all good.
That's because that's the most important thing.
Haru.
I won't be able to use magic for a while.
At the most, I can cast one Cure.
I need to go meditate somewhere.
I don't really understand magic, but Shihoru looks drained, too.
Let's go out, then.
We'll try not to bother the Lesser Kobolds.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash
For real?
You're dogged!
Marque, Em, Parc.
Thanks!
Huh?
Be careful!
Death Spots gets stronger from the wounds!
H-He gets stronger than this?!
W-What should we do?
Run?
That's the only thing we can do, but can we outrun him?
It'll be impossible on this straight path.
Someone... at least one of us needs to stay.
Before I knew it, my body started moving.
Spider!
Everyone, go!
Ranta!
Entrust you!
Haru?!
What are you doing?
We're leaving!
Let go!
We're leaving!
Merry...
Don't cry.
Yes... get out of here... everyone.
I can't hear you.
Don't give up!
Don't die, stupid Haruhiro!
That's right...
It's broken.
Don't give up in a situation like this?
You're demon, shitty Ranta.
But...
Merry... come back and cast Dispel on me, too.
Then, maybe we can meet again.
Someday...
This is...
It's a battle of life and death...
So I'm not going to give up, and I'll keep living.
I'll keep living until I die!
Come on!
Huh?
That's strange.
He stopped
No.
Wrong.
He's moving really slowly.
Don't think.
Huh?
Merry?
Is this...
Oh! You're finally awake.
S-Sorry.
Haruhiro-kun, here.
Thanks.
What's the matter?
What about Death Spots?
You don't remember?
Here!
This jog your memory?
A bounty of thirty golds.
Ranta suggested to discuss how we should split it after you woke up.
He said it was because you're the leader.
Ranta said that?
What? You got a problem with that?
Oh yeah, and when we went back to get you
Went to get me?
Oh, yeah... when you went back to get me.
You were lying next the Date Spots, you know.
Date?
Oh you mean Death Spots.
Oh, so... wait is that?
Yeah, my sword was broken anyway, and it seemed wieldy so I thought I'd try it out.
Wieldy? You're amazing, Moguzo.
Oh, no.
I can't use it like this, though.
I was thinking of taking it to a swordsmith.
I guess we've decided on one of the ways we'll be using the bounty on.
It's really okay?
When it's done, we need to give it a cute name.
A name?
Like Cleaver-kun One or something.
I-I guess it's kinda cute.
Not bad.
Haru.
Here.
I fixed this.
The slight weight and feeling of it settled onto me... and somewhere inside me, I felt calm.
It was a mysterious feeling.
And suddenly, it hit me.
I'm home, Merry.
Only now?
I heard, I heard all about it, Haruhirocchi!
You killed Spots, huh?
That's amazing!
I'm super jelly jealous!
Maybe not jelly, eh?
Austraaaliaaa!
Australia!!!
What's was that?
I'm glad... really glad.
Renji.
Renji.
Sorry.
Huh?
For what I did when Manato died.
Oh.
No, you don't need to apologize.
I don't?
I just... couldn't accept Manato's death yet... at that time.
So I should say thanks, Renji.
I see.
Everybody!
Drinks are on us today!
Drink up!
Here again?
Yeah.
I shouldn't come?
No, you can.
You know...
What?
Was being a leader...
Has it been tough for you?
I don't know.
Haruhiro...
Oh, really?
I'm different from who I was yesterday.
I wonder what I will be like tomorrow.
Day by day, we live in the today and keep living...
I'll be back, Manato.
As I continue living in this world...
The memories from what I should call the world I came from.
The feeling...
It did before.
But now, things are different.
The solid feeling of the stone beneath me...
And that's everything.
I now have things that I don't want to forget, and things that I shouldn't forget.
And I don't plan to ever forget those things...
Let's go, everyone!
See You Tomorrow...
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash
Having fun, laughing, getting hurt, and crying
Living in the presence of one another
Those moments in daily life
Become precious memories
The ever-changing twilight becomes a miracle
Once, I saw in the sky
The winds of the future blowing in my reflection
I'm glad I can meet you again tomorrow
This long, long road I've walked
Will bring me to another new world
I've been through meetings and farewells
Days pass by one by one
With memories I won't forget anymore
Drawing what's happening now on the horizon
The next morning will bring tomorrow
Soon, moving forward and farther ahead
Going towards the future as I am now
I'm glad I can meet you again tomorrow
This long, long road I've walked
Will bring me to another new world
