December 16th, X784. Tenroujima.
What was that?
Master...
The boat is almost ready to go,
but, um... What about Laxus?
I have nothin' to say to him!
I see...
He's got balls, setting foot on the guild's sacred ground
without permission and while in exile...
But that's...
Yeah. I heard about his battle with Hades.
Seems he saved your lives by shielding you.
I must acknowledge his efforts.
And I am grateful.
But still, they were the actions of a person who's unaffiliated with the guild.
That's a harsh judgment.
Well, sure...
That's how he's protected the guild all these years.
I just lent a hand here.
I got no other purpose.
Laxus...
Don't worry about me.
I was traveling in the area and only dropped by on a whim.
I never intended to stay long.
Hey, Old Man!
There it is. That face...
I think I had to see that disapproving look one last time.
Well, I'll be going...
Laxus!
What is it? What's wrong?
This feeling...
I wonder what it is...
This is a weird wind. And it reeks...
I know! Got just the thing!
Here Lucy, you can eat this.
Huh?! What'd you pull that out for?!
Hold Hands!
What is that?!
Probably just Lucy's stomach...
Huh?! This world's Lucy's stomach makes that kind of noise?!
Hey, Gajeel! Try to speak with a little more delicacy!
Well, in that case, I'd better prepare a heaping helping for her meal.
Hey! I was just kiddin'!
Be that as it may, it was a strange rumbling sound.
What the...? Now I can hear heavy breathing!
Hey, man, what are you sitting on?
What am I... A chair, of course...
When'd you get there?!
Juvia let Zeref get away,
so it's fitting she that become a chair for Gray-sama!
I told you I'm not into that stuff!
Here, Wendy. Thanks for your patience.
Mira-san, you're hurt, too. You shouldn't be serving...
Oh, that's okay. I enjoy doing it.
That's my big sister! What a Man!
Wrong!
What the hell was that for, wench?!
Man! Man!
Just looking at you makes my blood boil!
What the hell is that?!
Don't even ask!
Why, you... After you got all weepy when we were trapped by that tower...
One more word and I'm turning you to stone!
You two really get along...
Wrong!
What is this?!
A dragon's roar...
Huh?
A dragon?!
It's not thunder?!
Everyone! Are you okay?!
That's some loud roar!
You guys!
Hey... Are you alright?
An old wound's acting up on me...
There's no doubt. It's coming!
Hey! Heads up, everyone! Something's coming!
Natsu, what's wrong... Whoa!
What is that?!
It's huge!
It's...
Dragon!
What in the world...?
Seriously?!
A real dragon...
There are still dragons alive after all...
The Black Dragon of the Apocalypse...
Is this the one called Acnologia...?
Yeah...
That's the one.
Real dragons still exist...
You! Do you know where Igneel is?!
And Grandine and Metalicana, too?!
Knock it off, Natsu!
Don't provoke it! I know I told you how I got this arm...
No, how my whole body got like this!
Natsu, take a look at this.
It basically all happened in a flash.
My left arm and leg, and my internal organs, too...
I don't know what kind of guy this Igneel fellow is,
but the black one is an enemy of humanity. Of that, there's no doubt.
Plus... A human can't beat it.
It's coming down!
That's not the kind of dragon Natsu and the others love!
This is an evil one...
Yeah, you're right about that.
This bastard is humanity's enemy!
Then are we gonna fight it?
No. You're lookin' at this the wrong way, Natsu.
It's not about winning or losing with this one.
It's, how are we gonna escape from it?
No, more like, which of us are gonna survive?
You're sayin' this thing is gonna kill some of us?!
Oh, no! Everyone, run!
Master!
H-Hey...
What the hell...? The whole forest is just... gone.
I don't believe it!
How powerful is that thing?!
What is this? It did this with its roar alone?
What is that monster?!
It's...
Tch! What, is it admiring its work?!
I guess that was its way of introducing itself, for now...
We're all still alive, right?!
There's no time to be scared!
We gotta get off this island right away!
Gray-sama...?
Here it comes! Get your asses to the boat!
Run! We're all going home together!
Fairy Tail!
Wendy! I thought you could talk to dragons!
Can't you do something?!
It's not that only I can talk to them!
All dragons have a high level of intelligence!
What's it doing?!
Bickslow! Fried!
It cut us off?!
Why?!
Why are you doing this?! Answer me!
Maybe it's not using words...
Nobody would speak to vermin. It's the same thing...
And no one would bother using their full strength against vermin.
There are some things in this world you just can't fight against.
Elfman!
Don't! Eva!
Humankind is going to learn that now.
Eva?! I'm sorry!
No!
This can't be happening...
It looks like another long journey is about to begin.
This age is over.
Goodbye...
Damn you!
Gramps!
Run to the ship!
Ridiculous! There's no way he'll win!
Master! Please stop!
If something happened to you, the guild would...
Run!!
Under the circumstances, we should also...
Don't you dare make light of Fairy Tail!
We're gonna crush you!
Yeah!
Are you gonna ignore your master's orders even to the end?!
You damn brats!
The end...?
I'm a dragon slayer!
If that's the enemy, I'm gonna...
Run, Natsu!
Laxus! What're you...?!
Master!
Please, be safe!
Good...
One day, you'll understand.
Tears are hollow.
Are you sad because someone's gonna die?
Has sadness ever killed a person?
The answers are deep in each of your hearts...
My proud little brats!
Live on...
You bastard!
I don't know what you're after...
'Cause my brats are behind me!
For the first time... I acted like a parent.
I have no more regrets!
Gimme back...
Natsu!
Erza?! You too?!
I was against it...
leaving a senile old fool behind?
Bring it!
Idiots!
Hey, morons! All the power you have!
Anybody who says I don't have any more than this, I'll kick your ass!
Combine your puny Fairy Tail powers with my lightning attack
and let's knock this bastard for a loop!
Laxus!
Laxus-san?
Laxus?!
Hey, Natsu! Get outta the way!
W-W-Wait a second!
Laxus! Now!
Hey!
Raging Bolt!
Heaven's Wheel! Blumenblatt!
Super Freeze Arrow!
Water Nebula!
Solid Script Fire!
Sagittarius, now!
Evil Explosion!
Been a long time since the Raijinshuu fought together!
Really let'im have it!
Damned monster! You took everything we got and you're still grinnin'?!
You guys, last chance to take him down!
Go, Natsu!
Laxus, that asshole! I'm gonna beat the crap outta him later!
Yes, later...
Roar of the Iron Dragon!
Roar of the Sky Dragon!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Did they do it?
No.
Gildarts!
It's not using the power that it did when it fought me.
It's just playing with us!
Wha...?!
It ascended again!
Crap! It's as healthy as ever!
Bastard...
Even though we gave it all we had...
And we had the power of three dragon slayers...
Even with concentrating the entire guild's power together...
Damn it!
Some help Dragon Slayer Magic is!
What does it intend to do?!
Maybe it'll just go home...
Don't let your guard down!
Breath!
Don't tell me it means to wipe out the whole island?!
No way...
Oh, no...
Maybe it's just hopeless...
Is it gonna end for all of us here?
Everyone who can use defensive magic, go full power!
I don't have time to draw runes!
There's plenty of other kinds of defensive magic you can do with letter based magic!
Th-That's right.
That's our Levy!
Everyone! Focus all your magic power on the Fried and Levy!
Everyone hold hands!
We're not gonna let it end here!
Right! I refuse to give up!
Everyone, join your power together as one!
Let's show this creature the bond of our guild!
That's right! Let's all go home together!
To Fairy Tail!
It's over, huh, Natsu?
December 16th, X784. Tenroujima.
Acnologia annihilated the island.
Then, Acnologia disappeared once more.
A search was conducted in the surrounding sea for the following six months,
but no survivors were to be found...
And so, seven years passed...
Natsu, what happened to us?
I dunno. I remember we were attacked by the black dragon,
then we all got surrounded by this glowing light, and then...
Do you think maybe we all died?
Don't be an idiot!
You think Fairy Tail could be killed off so easily?!
Well, then where is everyone?
Next time: Fairy Tail, X791
For now, let's just track everyone down and go home!
Yeah. You're right. Let's all go home together, to the guild.
