Your lives...? Hey...
This is getting vicious.
Even though that's not something you bet on...
That's our Yukino-kun!
That's why she's part of Sabertooth!
Good luck, Yukino!
This is getting interesting.
Does that Yukino chick have all her marbles?
Kagura-san...
Even though her opponent is Kagura, the strongest wizard of Mermaid Heel,
it seems she's got confidence to spare.
If you are sincerely prepared to do this,
then accepting it is the proper thing to do.
Fine. Come and get me.
Kagura versus Yukino!
Seriously?!
They bet their lives, so whoever loses dies, right?!
Can they do that?!
Well, things have taken a serious turn.
Just what's going on here?!
This is not cool!
I set up a good match if I do say so myself.
This should be a lively battle.
It's your bad luck to be standing before a member of Sabertooth.
Lucy-san, is that...
That girl is a Celestial Spirit Wizard?!
I don't believe it!
There's one more?
Another Celestial Spirit Wizard...
Huh...
A golden key. One of those 12 Zodiac Gate things?
Gate of the Fish, I open thee.
Gate of the Fish! I like the sound of that!
What kind of Celestial Spirit is it?
I don't know...
I don't think it was in the Celestial Spirit World when we visited.
Going by the usual pattern, it's probably something like this.
That's kind of unsettling...
But there are ones like the Gemini twins too,
so my guess is it'll be like this.
I have a feeling you've hit the mark...
Happy will be so pleased!
That's not even a fish...
Wendy, don't waste your time contradicting that guy.
His stupidity will rub off.
Pisces!
They are fish!
Don't worry!
Take a good look.
See?
Wow!
She's dodging their attacks with just the slightest movements.
There are all kinds, huh?
Pisces...
Huh. She's not bad.
What? She's no great shakes.
All she's doing is dodging.
Fro thinks so, too.
Just wait and see.
It's not wise to underestimate Mermaid Heel's strongest wizard.
This looks like it's going to quickly become a fine magic battle.
Whoa! She's deftly dodging Pisces' fierce attacks!
Impressive.
Cool!
Why is she escaping the fish?
All she has to do is eat it...
What a waste.
If you're so good at dodging, then all I need to do is ground you.
Two gates open at the same time?!
Glittering gold!
That's right! That's one of the 12 Zodiac Gates, too!
Gate of the Scales, I open thee.
Libra!
A-Another stunningly beautiful Celestial Spirit!
She's a sight for sore eyes!
Gate of the Scales! Cool!
Libra, alter the target's gravity.
As you wish!
That's gravity manipulation!
That Libra character can use the same magic as me?!
So she made Kagura heavier?
Pisces...
What's this?!
She blew off Libra's gravity power?!
How?
That girl's awesome!
Her jumping ability is remarkable.
No, that's...
Libra...
Make the target's gravity go sideways.
As you wish.
Ouch! She was only able to escape the Celestial Spirit's gravity altering for a short time!
Kagura is pinned to the statue!
What a pinch!
Gravity is cool!
Pisces!
This is what I'm talkin' about! The highlight of two gates open at once!
Highlight!
I guess it's all over...
Or I wish it would be...
The fish stopped!
What the...?
Is she out of magic?
That's not it. Look at that.
I can't move!
I see...
Don't tell me she can use gravity magic too?!
How?
Kagura's the one who taught me gravity-altering magic.
Better not underestimate Kagura-chan!
That's right!
That's our...
Now, finish'em all at once!
This is the epitome of the Grand Magic Games!
Oh, my! Kagura is undaunted by two Celestial Spirits!
This is amazing, isn't it, Yajima-san?
Experience and grit... She certainly does have fortitude.
I'm so excited about getting to see a showdown like this right before my eyes! Cool! Cool!
Heavy...
Pisces, Libra, go back.
Yeesh. This is gettin' monotonous.
Yukino...
She's fine! The fight is just startin'!
Right, Sting-kun?!
That's right. Yukino's gonna bring out her real power now.
You're going to make me open...
The 13th Gate?!
Is that what she just said?!
What's wrong, Lucy-san?
There are 12 Zodiac Gates and hence 12 keys...
But I've heard rumors of a 13th key...
Opening the 13th Gate... That means you're out of luck.
Luck, huh?
I haven't relied on luck since the moment I was born.
Everything has come about through choices that I've made!
Gate of the Serpent Bearer, I open thee!
That's what's leading me to the future!
Ophiuchus!
What is this?! I didn't know a Celestial Spirit like this existed!
It's humongous!
Serpent Bearer?! The thing itself is a serpent!
This is... Ophiuchus?!
The 13th Gate... This is outstanding as well.
This doesn't bode well...
Not only are there two Celestial Spirit Wizards here, but they both own the 12 Zodiac Gates.
Blade of Resentment, Archenemy.
Style of the Unsheathed Sword.
Is she for real?!
Unsheathed...
You really wouldn't want Kagura-chan to unsheathe her sword.
I don't believe it!
You made a cheap bet.
Sometimes, mermaids eat tigers.
T-T-The match is over!
The winner is Kagura Mikazuchi of Mermaid Heel!
I knew Kagura-chan could do it!
Yeah!
Told you not to underestimate Kagura!
That Celestial Spirit Wizard is powerful in her own right, but Kagura is just too tough.
It's unbelievable, but Sabertooth got zero points on the second day!
This is getting interesting.
Cool! Kagura-chan is cool!
Was the Saber woman weak? Or was the Mermaid woman strong?
The latter...
I didn't know somebody like her existed...
I-I lost...
Sabertooth lost...
Yukino...
Sting-kun...
Your life...
Your life belongs to me.
Understand?
Yes.
As you say...
And thus ends the second day of the Grand Magic Games!
Raven Tail gained ten points today, giving them first place with 36 points!
Sabertooth gained zero points today,
but their 20 points from yesterday keeps them in second place!
Likewise, Lamia Scale is tied in second with 20 points!
And Mermaid Heel is moving up. They gained ten points, putting them in fourth place with 19 points.
In fifth place, one rank down, is Blue Pegasus with 17 points!
Cool!
And in sixth place, one rank down for them, Quatro Puppy!
S-Seriously?!
Um... Our guild name has become Quatro Puppy...
Can't help it. A promise was made between two men.
Alright! I'm gonna drink again tonight! Wild...
And gaining ten points each, but still tied in last place, are Fairy Tail A Team
and Fairy Tail B Team, both with 12 points!
What kind of battles are in store for us tomorrow, the third day of the tournament?!
Those were some fine magic battles.
Another Celestial Spirit Wizard...
It must be destiny...
Now the project is even more certain to succeed.
This can't go on.
I have to do something quickly...
It is strange...
Even though the second day is over, I haven't sensed the magic power that I perceive every year.
The second day of the Grand Magic Games ended.
Five more days until that fateful day...
You don't sense the magic power?
Right.
The power that was similar to Zeref's, that we felt every year...
I haven't sensed it this time, not yet.
What does it mean?
I can think of many possibilities.
If it came from a person,
maybe they're not in Crocus this time.
Or maybe they're in Crocus, but not using the power.
It's also possible that they're a contestant in the Games, but haven't participated yet.
If that magic is from some kind of device or a set location,
perhaps the device isn't in operation,
or there's some sort of filter that keeps the magic from leaking outside.
At any rate, as long as you don't sense that dangerous power, nothing should happen.
I hope you're right.
Maybe I'll check out the organizers from tomorrow.
Don't do anything to stand out.
I know. Ultear already reminded me.
And try not to get yourself killed.
Got it. Goodnight, Erza.
Yeah.
I never thought the day would come when we could talk normally like this.
Thank you, Erza.
It's gotten late. Is the dinner party over already?
I found you at last!
Who are you?!
Feelin' spiffy?!
Feelin' spiffy!
You...
Er-chan, long time no see!
Millianna!
I missed you!
Millianna!
You're in a guild?
Yep. Mermaid Heel.
Are Sho and Wally in the same guild?
What are you talking about? Mermaid Heel is a women-only guild!
I see.
Those two are still traveling. I hear from them once in a while.
I see. It really is great to see you, Millianna.
Me too, Er-chan.
I'm so happy to see you doing well.
Er-chan, don't cry!
What about you?!
Alright, another round!
My soul is always Wild...
You guys are good sports!
Same goes for you!
It's gettin' pretty late. We better start headin' back to the inn.
Erza hasn't come yet!
Now that you mention it, she is late...
She mentioned having something to do.
Are your hands okay?
Nothin' a good night's sleep can't fix!
We're wild, right?
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.
That guy's name is Elfman, yeah?
Give him a message for me.
Tell him it was a wild battle...
An' I'm lookin' forward to goin' up against him again during the tournament.
I'll tell him. I wanna fight you myself.
We're gonna beat you again next time, too!
Man!
Four!
Jeez... Enough already...
By the way, where's Gramps?
He was having a drinking contest with Bacchus-san...
He's probably on the floor over there.
Lu-chan?
Sorry we woke you up...
Never mind about that.
What's wrong? You look down.
Yeah... I was thinking about Saber's Celestial Spirit Wizard...
Yukino-san, I think her name is, right?
That was amazing. The 12 Zodiac Gates and the 13th one... I think? Even though she lost...
They said they bet their lives, so I was wondering what's gonna happen now...
True, it is worrisome...
Even though we're in no position to be worried about other people...
What? We've still got three days left!
You're right. First, we need to focus on winning and do our best!
Hey! You guys got a visitor. They're in here.
Leon and... Sherry's cousin.
Cheria-san, right?
This looks like it's gonna be a pain...
This is Crocus Garden, the inn where Sabertooth is staying.
It's so pitiful that I can't even cry, you scum.
Remember why we're the top wizard guild.
Don't look at the insects around you. Don't talk to them. Just crush them.
Our eyes are on something far greater.
Making the heavens roar. Setting the land aflame. Silencing the seas.
That's Sabertooth.
This man is Sabertooth's master, Gemma.
Sting...
Yes?
I'll give you just one more chance.
Don't you ever make such a pathetic scene again.
Thank you. I swear that I'll measure up to your expectations.
Yukino...
Yes.
You have no excuse.
You do know that?
Yes.
I lost to the member of another guild. I brought shame to Sabertooth.
That's not what I'm talking about!
You wagered your life and lost, and not only that, the enemy took pity on you!
On Sabertooth!
Yes.
I will submit to any punishment.
Then throw away everything.
Yes. I will do exactly as you say.
And so ended the second day of the Grand Magic Games.
Somehow, Fairy Tail emerged as a contender, even while staying in last place,
but on the underside of the spectacular festival,
something most of them never dreamed of was slowly set into motion.
Pop quiz! Who's going to pay a visit now?
Where's this comin' from?! How the hell would I know?
Then I'll give you a hint. What are those white crystals that fall from the sky in winter?
Y-Yuki...
snow
What's the opposite of yes?
No!
If you put'em together, you'll pretty much have the answer!
Yuki-no!
Natsu...
Next time: Grudges Are Wrapped in the Silence of the Night!
Yuki-no, right?
Natsu, you know who it is but you're saying it weird on purpose!
