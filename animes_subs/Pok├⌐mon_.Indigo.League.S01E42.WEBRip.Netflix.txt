Ash's quest to become a Pokemon Master
brings our heroes to a vast desert.
So, where's that town you were talking about, Brock?
It's dark already.
You don't think we're going to camp out in a place like this, do you?
Chill out. It's got to be around here somewhere.
Wow! That must be it!
Look at all the lights.
Wow, it sure is bright.
Pikachu.
I knew it. This is Neon Town.
Doh. What rotten luck.
People love to come here'cause it's open all day and all night.
It never closes?
-There's action 24 hours a day. -Wow.
Hey, watch where you're going, you jerk.
You watch it. You're the one who bumped into me.
-Oh, yeah? -
Hey, ash. Just apologize.
He should apologize. He's the one who bumped into me.
Why you little-
All right. Break it up, you two! There's no fighting here.
Eh, that little runt's not worth it.
You kids shouldn't be walking the streets at night.
I'm sorry, Officer, but we just got into town.
Then you go find yourselves a hotel or something.
People around here are pretty short-tempered!
-Short-tempered? -Pi?
They're on edge because they stay out all night and don't get enough sleep.
You kids should find a hotel, get a good night's rest,
and mind your own business.
What do you think you're doing?
- Shut up! -There's another one.
This jenny seems a little edgy too.
I just love all these bright lights.
Watch where you're going.
Oh, yeah? You walk into me, and then you start complaining?
You walked into him. Huh? Huh?
That hurt.
I'll make you pay for that.
Oh, I think we should prepare for trouble.
- Hey, who do you think you are? - Watch it.
I don't believe it. Everyone in town is already awake.
-Look at them. - I wonder when they sleep.
Break it up. Calm down. Move along.
Let's just keep moving.
Yeah, this place makes me nervous.
Ah, it's much nicer here in the woods where it's quiet.
Yeah, it was so loud in Neon Town, I couldn't get any sleep.
Hey, what's that?
- Isn't that a Jigglypuff? -Jiggly.
You're right, Brock, it's a Jigglypuff. I've always wanted one of those.
I though you only liked water Pokemon.
I do, but I like this one, too.
I'll capture it. Staryu, go!
Psy.
Psyduck, I didn't want you. Return.
Staryu. Double edge.
-What's wrong? -It looks like it's crying.
There's something strange about it.
I wonder what its problem is.
Jigglypuff, a balloon Pokemon.
It has large, friendly eyes, and it sings a pleasant song.
A Pokemon that sings? Oh, that's so cute.
-Sing for us. -Puff.
What's the matter?
Please sing us a song.
Is something wrong?
Jigglypuff.
I think it's saying that it can't sing.
Hmm-hmm.
I see, a Jigglypuff that can't sing. So that's why it didn't attack.
Oh, I'm sorry I bothered you, little Jigglypuff.
Jigglypuff. Jiggly-jiggly.
I still think it's cute, but who wants a Jigglypuff that can't sing?
Jigglypuff.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Hey, I know.
Why don't we see if we can help this little Jigglypuff to sing?
Good idea. We can't just leave it here alone.
Jiggly.
It looks like those kids found a Jigglypuff.
A Jigglypuff?
A Jigglypuff's songs have the power to put people to sleep.
Then I got a great idea.
We get that jiggly-thing to sing to everybody in Neon Town.
And when it does...
It's naptime for Neon Town.
And then we grab anything and everything we want.
That'll teach them not to mess with us.
Finally, Team Rocket is about to enjoy the success we so richly deserve.
Let's get on with it.
Right.
-Greetings, you Pokemon pipsqueaks. -Huh? What are those guys doing here?
Pump it up to the max.
J You know us as Team Rocket And we fight for what is wrong J
J We're tired of our motto So we thought we'd try a song J
-Jessie. -James.
The speed of light, prepare to fight.
J Meowth, that's right J
J I am the handsome one J
J I'm the gorgeous one J
J Looking good is lots of fun J
J We get some things wrong But we keep rolling along J
J We want to capture Pikachu We hope to do it soon J
J And when we do We'll be the new stars of this J
J Cartoon J
You need to work on your timing. You were late on the last verse.
But my pitch was perfect.
So, what's your crummy plan this time?
We need Jigglypuff to sing one of its little lullabies for us.
Its lullabies?
Jigglypuff's going to sing Team Rocket right to the top.
Hey, Ash, this looks bad.
I choose you, Bulbasaur!
-Bulbasaur. -Take care of them!
-Get them, Weezing. -Weezing.
-Weezing, poison gas attack. -Bulbasaur, vine whip.
Bulbasaur.
Weezing.
Okay, Staryu.
J Do, ti, la, sol, fa, mi, re, do J Like that.
See how I control my breathing as I sing the notes?
You're a great voice teacher, Misty.
Okay. Now it's your turn.
- -Huh?
It doesn't look like it really wants to sing.
J Pika, pika, pika, pik... J
- Very good, Pikachu. -Pika.
Hey, Ash, you're hurting Jigglypuff's feelings.
- -Pika? Pika?
-What is it, Pikachu? -Kachu.
Now you try it. Fill up the balloon like this.
It'll help make your lungs bigger and stronger.
I told you. It doesn't want to.
-Take it. Here you go. -Hmm?
- -Forget it. This isn't working.
Let's see.
There it is. Here, look at this.
What's that, Brock?
The juice of this fruit has very special properties.
It has the power to heal your throat if it's sore or tired.
If Jigglypuff eats it, it might start singing.
Would you like to try some?
-Give it a try, Jigglypuff. -Jiggly.
Wow, this just might be the answer.
- Puff. -
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
-Hooray! -Jiggly, jiggly!
Pika. Pika. Pikachu.
-Jigglypuff. -
Now, sing your song for us, Jigglypuff.
Jiggly.
-Hmm? -What's the matter, Pikachu?
Pikachu.
-Please sing for us, Jigglypuff. -Jiggly.
Hmm?
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jiggly J
J Jigglypuff, jiggly J
Good thinking, Jessie. Why go through the trouble of capturing Jigglypuff...
When all we want is its voice?
We'll just record it and use it ourselves.
We got it made.
It's over there.
Time to record.
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff, Jiggly... J
Puff?
Jiggly? Jiggly?
Puff.
Jigglypuff.
Jiggly.
- -Puff?
Jiggly. Jiggly.
Jigglypuff.
Jigglypuff.
Jigglypuff. Jigglypuff.
Puff!
What a nice nap.
What happened to your face?
Huh?
- -Huh?
Hmm.
-What's wrong, Jigglypuff? -Jiggly.
-What's it mad at? -I don't know.
Maybe it's mad'cause we fell asleep while it was singing.
Uh, no way.
Why would it be mad about something like that?
I wouldn't be too happy if people fell asleep
while I was performing for them.
Neither would I.
We're sorry, little Jigglypuff.
-Puff. -
I've got it. Maybe there are some Pokemon that wouldn't fall asleep.
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jiggly J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jiggly... J
Puff.
Oh, they all fell asleep.
Jigglypuff's song is strong.
-I know. - Hmm?
We should let it sing to Psyduck.
Psyduck's too doofy to know whether it's awake or asleep anyway.
Great.
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jiggly... J
Hmm?
Mm. Hey.
Psyduck stayed awake and heard you sing.
Good old Psyduck, you finally did something right.
Puff.
What are you angry about now, Jigglypuff?
Psyduck listened to the whole thing.
-Puff. -What's wrong?
Hmm?
You stupid Pokemon, you're just sleeping with your eyes open!
Psy!
-Who did this? -How dare they?
Wait a sec. We got to check to see if we got the Jigglypuff on tape.
Oh, good idea.
-What is that awful sound? -It's all of us snoring.
What are we supposed to do with that?
What else can we do for it?
It must be frustrating to have such a beautiful voice,
and have no one listen to the whole song.
I know. Neon town's the perfect place for it.
Hey, that's right.
Since those people never seem to have to sleep...
They'll be able to listen to Jigglypuff sing.
Now, you'll get to sing for all the people in Neon Town, Jigglypuff.
Jiggly!
Did you hear that?
Those fools are going to do exactly what we'd planned to do with Jigglypuff.
With enemies like that, who needs friends?
Now, where can it sing so that everyone will be able to hear it?
It would be great if we could find an outdoor stage someplace.
Let's ask somebody.
An outdoor stage?
Yes, do you know where we can find a place like that?
Hey, there's nothing like that anywhere in town.
Now, get lost. I'm busy.
Oh, what a big jerk.
Worse than a jerk. He was out-and-out mean.
Hey, we heard you're the ones who are looking for an outdoor stage.
-Huh? -Yeah, that's right. We are.
You can go ahead and use ours if you want to.
Huh?
- Hey, all right. - Cool.
Uh, we can really use it?
Sure, we love to showcase new talent.
Crank the speakers up to 11.
-Thank you very much. This is great. -Pikachu.
We finally met someone in Neon Town who's nice.
This will be perfect.
Isn't this great, Jigglypuff? You can sing from the stage.
Jigglypuff. Jigglypuff.
How sweet.
Now, everyone in town will hear.
And afterwards, the town is ours for the taking.
Hey. Don't forget these things.
Oh, our earplugs, of course.
- Huh, what's that? -Hmm?
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff, Jiggly J
-Song. -What's that song?
J Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff J
-Hmm? -Huh?
J Jigglypuff, Jiggly J
- Where's that coming from? -What is that?
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff, Jiggly J
J Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff J -I don't think my ears are plugged enough.
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jiggly J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jigglypuff J
J Jiggly... J
Hmm? Puff!
What a great nap that was.
-Uh-oh. Everybody in town fell asleep. -It sure seems so.
-I wonder where Jigglypuff went to. -Oh, I bet it's pretty mad.
I wanted to tell you,
I'm really sorry about starting that fight with you yesterday.
Oh, no, no. It was my fault.
Huh?
Jigglypuff's song not only puts people to sleep,
but maybe it has the power to make people nicer, too.
- Hey, it's you. -Huh?
I just wanted to apologize for bumping into you like that last night.
-Uh, you're that guy. -Yeah, I'm sorry.
That's okay. Thanks for the apology.
So, where's Jigglypuff gone?
-Did it get mad and run off somewhere? -Jigglypuff!
We've failed again. The earplugs didn't even work.
But the skies are blue and the air is so fresh.
Isn't life great?
Tra-la-la-la-la!
This is great. Everyone in town is so happy now.
Yeah, everyone needs a good rest now and then to recharge.
But where could Jigglypuff have run off to?
I wanted to capture it.
Maybe it started its own quest to find someone
who can hear its song all the way through.
I hope we meet Jigglypuff again.
After hearing Jigglypuff's song and resting up,
our heroes continue their journey refreshed in mind, body, and spirit.
-Puff. - Huh?
Jigglypuff.
Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff, Jiggly, jiggly, jig!
Wait for Jigglypuff.
