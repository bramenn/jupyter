Ichika likes you.
What do you want?
Must be rough, eh, Uesugi-kun?
Tutoring the Nakanos.
How did you know about that?
My dad's the president of this high school.
We and their father have been in a very friendly relationship.
Damn elite cabals.
I can't imagine you'd have the time to be tutoring right now, though.
Now that you've fallen from the top of our grade,
there've been discussions that I ought to take over.
I've finally taken the top position in our grade from you!
Yes!
I win! I win!
Yes! Oh, yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Uesugi-kun,
our long-standing rivalry has come to an end!
It began two years ago, when I was pursuing the top of the grade, and you appeared...
Wait, who are you?
Y'know, I'm Takeda Yusuke. I've been on your heels in grades this whole time.
Never heard of you.
I've only ever gotten full marks. I've never thought about anyone second or below.
Second or below?!
All right.
Let's begin our study session.
Um...
Is Takeda-kun joining us?
Why are you following me?
You don't have time to be doing this, do you?
There's something more important for you to be doing.
What are you talking about?
To be frank,
these girls are holding you back.
Holding him back?!
For him to quit tutoring would be in his best interest, above all else.
It's your fault.
You turned him into a mediocre man.
I'd appreciate if you'd free him already.
You're right.
But until last summer, or rather, if I hadn't taken this job,
I would have failed to even be a mediocre man.
I'd thought I knew it all just from memorizing textbooks cover to cover.
I never knew that there were such idiots in the world.
I'm going to stick with them for as long as they want.
Futaro.
If you insist, I'd like to see you prove it with results.
If you don't make it in, say, the top one hundred of the coming national mock exams,
I'll have you accept my conditions.
Top hundred?
Forget about it.
Top ten.
I'm going to continue tutoring them
and make it into the top ten of the national mock exams.
And I'm going to prove that they aren't holding me back.
Uesugi-san!
You're going big.
You don't stand a chance.
Especially if you're teaching the five of them at the same time.
Five Cranes in Return
Nakano Quintuplets
Futaro's birthday is coming up in three days, right?
We've been thinking about what to get him
But do you think it might get
in the way of his exam studies?
Let's scrap the idea for now
Sorry, I'm going to go get some fresh air.
I need to get their grades up so they can graduate.
I'd like to focus on my own mock exam, but...
No, I need to make both happen.
They aren't holding me back.
Futaro.
Miku.
Oh, I am very serious.
About the day after tomorrow...
About the day before yesterday...
Go ahead.
You go.
What are you guys talking about?
Wh-What does it matter?
Do you think Futaro will be okay?
He'll be fine.
All we can do is lighten his burden as much as we can.
So let's forget about the birthday thing for now.
Okay.
I can't regret what I did.
This is how I decided I was going to fight.
I've put the brakes on the others, so this is my chance!
I'm going to be the only one giving him a gift.
I can't be having second thoughts now.
I spent too long choosing, and now I'm late.
Nino.
What's that?
Oh, these?
Stress-relieving candles.
His birthday's almost here.
Oh, shoot.
I was supposed to keep it a secret until the day of.
Didn't you see my message last night?
Oh, that?
I did, but I want to give him a gift, so I will.
Hang on, does that mean I'm the only one giving him a gift?
It'll work even better, then.
I forgot.
Nino's brakes are busted!
So?
Huh? So what?
You have a gift for him too, don't you?
We're going to have to make one thing clear.
I asked you to stop Dad on the last day of our spring break vacation.
And yet, he arrived where we were supposed to meet up.
Do you have an explanation?
We all have different tastes for quintuplets, right?
Yeah, and that always makes doing the cooking a real pain.
Nino, do you like Futaro-kun?
I love him.
So do I.
Why does this have to be the one thing we agree on?
Sorry, Nino, but I don't plan on letting you have him.
How condescending, just because you're technically the oldest sister.
Who even gives a guy aromatherapy candles?
What? Your gift card's pretty tacky, too!
Why?
He can use it to buy what he really wants!
You scared me.
I thought Uesugi-san came back.
What are you making, Yotsuba?
One crane of thousand.
I thought we could make them for him to help his grades.
Isn't that something you give to sick people?
I've heard they do bring good luck.
Uesugi-san seems kind of tired.
He never admits it,
but tutoring us while he's also studying himself is a huge burden,
so I want him to at least stay healthy.
Done!
Didn't we agree not to do gifts, though?
Sorry!
I didn't mean it that way!
Y-Yotsuba, we're in the library.
You don't have to beat yourself up over it!
I hate myself!
I feel like I'm cheating!
I'm a horrible human being for breaking our agreement!
Um...
Sorry.
These are couples tickets for the gym.
I thought we could train together.
I asked for a partial advance on my pay so I could afford them.
Sorry for trying to get ahead.
We sure are quintuplets.
Let's do this, then.
It'll get in the way of his studying if we give him anything before the mock exams.
So let's all give him our gifts after.
Okay!
That sounds good.
H-Hey!
Who said you could decide?
Are you even okay with that?
You guys don't get him.
Even if we all give him our gifts, he's going to like mine the best.
So nothing on his actual birthday, then?
I know!
How about this?
Studying so late?
You must be having a rough time.
De-drowsifier
This is for you.
Itsuki.
What do you mean?
This isn't rough.
Who do you think I am?
I visited a cram school instructor named Shimoda-san the other day.
I don't know if it counts as work,
but I'm going to aim to improve my academic capabilities while I assist Shimoda-san.
Am I not good enough?
Please don't get upset.
This isn't about you.
I just wanted to do a job that I could make part of myself.
For the sake of my dream past the mock exams and past graduation,
I wanted to get a look at education in action.
I can never predict you guys.
Ever since the new term, Yotsuba, Nino, Ichika, and even Miku...
Has something happened?
I'll tell you someday.
How long has it been?
From: Raiha Onii-chan, when are you coming home? We're ready for your birthday party
Oh, yeah, that was today.
I should go home.
Five cranes?
What's this?
National Mock Exams Day 1 Day 2 840 Socials 1 840 Science 1 950 Socials 2 950 Science 2 1100 Japanese 1100 Math 1 1320 English (written)hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 1420 English (listening)hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I guess I'm not alone.
They're working hard, too.
I have to keep up.
We've received the results of the national mock exam from several days ago.
Though their grades vary, all of them have made considerable progress since last year.
I was eighth nationally.
6 Kurosaki Riko 7 Miyazono Akina 8 Takeda Yusuke 9 Ono Wakana 10 Azumi Hiroto
And Uesugi-kun...
5 Hashikawa Masaki 4 Maebashi Yuki 3 Uesugi
You got me.
Third nationally?
I have to tip my hat to you, Uesugi-kun.
Komugiya
Um...
This is a bakery, right?
Not a rock shop?
W-Well, Nakano-san just started working here.
It looks dead.
I don't get it.
I'm having her follow the instructions.
She has some mysterious ability to screw it up.
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.
H-Have confidence!
I think it's becoming more food-like than before.
Keep it up!
Okay.
It's bread!
Did you really make this, Miku?
Yup.
We can't quite sell this yet.
I'm glad you got this far, though, Miku-chan.
Thank you, manager.
Let's have Uesugi-san try this.
I bet he'll be surprised.
It's not that good yet.
Did you say you were aiming for the school trip?
Yes.
Lunch on the first day is supposed to be up to us.
In raiding and plundering be like fire.
I'm going to give him my best one when we're there.
I see!
I'm sure he'll love it.
There's one more problem, though.
We might not be able to spend lunch together if we aren't in the same group.
I want to tour Kyoto with him more than anything.
Miku...
Leave this to me!
School Trip
With the national mock exams over,
I'd like to discuss the school trip.
We'll be forming groups for our activities.
Each group can have up to five people.
Let's see...
Where is Uesugi-san?
There!
Hey! Uesugi
Yotsuba.
Over here.
What's up, Ichika?
I can't wait for the school trip, can you?
People are having trouble with forming groups of five or less...
but it's perfect for us, huh?
Good thing we're quintuplets, huh?
But what about Futaro-kun?
He's a third-year, and he doesn't seem to have any friends.
I'm worried about him.
Um... In that case...
All right.
We should make a sacrifice for him.
Ichika?
You, me, and Futaro-kun should form a group.
Is that okay?
Huh? Ichika!
Sorry, I got a call.
Okay, take care of it!
Jeez, Onii-chan.
You're glued to your desk again on your day off.
What else am I supposed to do on my precious day off?
Oh, right, I have to thank you for the birthday party.
Is it a gift?!
What is it?
Super easy-to-understand Exam questions
No thanks.
You don't need to thank me.
You should be thanking Yotsuba-san.
Why would you bring up Yotsuba?
I knew you'd forget!
Didn't she help you at school camp?
I told you, you need to give her something in return.
It's a new school year. I can't believe you'd just left it.
That's what's wrong with you, Onii-chan!
Huh? A gift for me?
From you?
My budget is 1,000... 1,500 yen.
Is that why you showed up here out of nowhere?
It's so like you to ask, though.
Shouldn't you make it a surprise or something?
I'm tired of giving gifts that people don't want.
Just tell me what you want.
Let's see...
I know a good place to go.
This is going to be a fun day!
You sure?
So far, we're just walking.
That's why it's fun.
This is a date.
Wh-Why don't we go for lunch first?
Lunch, huh? I'm up for anything.
This restaurant is Itsuki's favorite.
There's no way we're going to eat here for under 1,500 yen.
This is the spa Miku was a member at.
No way!
Cursed Reply
The movie Ichika's in.
Ooh.
Good thing she gave me tickets.
That wouldn't make it a gift from me.
Finally, I found it!
I've been looking for this.
Clothes, huh?
I'll buy you that, then.
I wouldn't mind going a little over budget.
Yay!
Nino's been wanting this.
I bet she'll be happy.
Hang on a second.
Yotsuba, what is it that you want?
The restaurant, the spa, the theater, shopping...
None of it was about you.
Um, just give me a second.
I'm going to think about it.
Uh...
Uesugi-san, what is it that I want?
Nakano
Where has Yotsuba gone?
We were supposed to clean up around the house today.
Itsuki-chan, do you recognize this box?
Oh, that's my stuff.
I packed up some clothes that I don't think I'll be wearing.
You should throw it out if you don't need it.
Not that I can talk.
Itsuki-chan, you dropped something.
This is from Kyoto.
I see.
Huh...
I'm surprised you know a place like this.
I come to this park often.
I hop on the swing when I'm a bit bummed.
I-I guess this is nothing fancy, though.
Let's go somewhere nicer.
It's been a while, but I've still got it.
Uesugi-san?
Are you impressed, Yotsuba?
Jeez, you're like a child.
Besides, that's not that impressive.
I'll show you how it's done. Watch this.
See? How's that!
I can go even higher!
I like this view you get when you swing full force.
It's not exactly a million-dollar nightscape,
but when I imagine that there's a home a familyfor every light...
I feel warm inside.
And then...
I beat my old record!
Can you come this far, Uesugi-san?
Of course I...
U-Uesugi-san!
Did you see that?!
What just happened?!
What is it that you want?
What on earth are you doing?
Anyway, it's late. Let's go home.
Huh? Okay.
Man, I never got her anything.
Do I have anything?
Super easy-to-understand Exam questions
I-If this will do...
That's so you, Uesugi-san.
Thank you.
But I already got what I wanted.
You did?
Yes.
Okay, then.
Are you sure?
Let's come back again.
With everyone, next time.
This is for middle schoolers!
Hey, you're all here today.
Well, let's start studying.
But first, I want to talk about the school trip.
Futaro, have you chosen who you're going to go with?
Wait!
Yotsuba said she has something to say.
U-Um...
Right?
What?
Hurry up.
U-Um, well...
Miku and Ichika can come with...
But Itsuki and Nino...
We sisters have to stay together.
Oh, I know!
Let's just all be in the same group!
You, too, Uesugi-san!
Wha?
That would be ideal, but we can only have up to five per group.
I meant everyone besides me.
That solves everything.
That's a bit much.
I can't have that, Yotsuba.
Is there a problem?
There is.
A huge one.
Yeah.
The problem is that no one wants that.
At the very least, I don't.
How about this, then?
Fu-kun and I form a group by ourselves.
Fu-kun?
I don't know what Yotsuba was about to say,
but that's been my plan all along.
I'm going with who I like.
You don't get to say no.
U-Uh, Nino, I never...
Stay out of this, Fu-kun.
Fu-kun...
I-I...
If you have something to say, say it now.
It's settled.
No, it's not!
Hear me out!
I told you to stay quiet!
Just be grateful that you get to go on a date with me!
I already made a group with some guys from our class.
Sorry.
Who's going to be the group leader?
You mustn't forget about me.
Why does it have to be this way?
I thought those five would make a group.
They must be really tight-knit, to go as sisters.
So it's the same as always.
I'm glad Futaro-kun has some friends now.
School Trip
This is so awkward!
