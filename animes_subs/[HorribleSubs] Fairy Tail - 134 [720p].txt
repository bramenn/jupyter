Huh?
Something's shining!
Natsu-nii...
This is delish!
Michelle made all of this!
Eat up!
Come on over, Romeo!
Um...
What is this?
From the looks of it, I'd say...
It's some kind of entrance, isn't it?
But how did this get here?
Everyone, back off!
Wait!
Cut it out!
It looks like magic doesn't work on it...
In the first place, we'll get nothing out of it if you break it! Jeez!
I wonder if there's a way to turn it on...
Hey, is this...
A keyhole?!
Yeah, right?
But we don't have a key...
If that's the problem, then leave it to me!
Ebi...
So would you open this lock?
With scissors, the life of any hair and makeup artist-ebi?
It's my fault... It's all my fault...
Don't cry!
Okay-ebi!
That was easy...
Men!
I knew he could do it!
Wonderful!
It was a cinch-ebi!
I-I have a bad feeling about this...
Labyrinth Rhapsody!
Gray-sama, this way...
Oh, the entrance, huh?
So this is it?
It's obviously suspicious...
For now, the only thing to do is go inside.
Forbidden! It is forbidden to enter!
Looks like a gatekeeper...
Yeesh...
Sorry...
But we don't have time to play!
What the hell is this?!
Our magic had no effect on it!
I am impervious under my gaze!
Magic has no effect...?
Pain in the ass...
Those eyes... Maybe...
So its eyes are its weakness! Nice job figuring that out!
It said impervious under my gaze, so Juvia thought maybe...
It's opening!
That's my Juvia-chan!
Please don't use -chan with my name!
Whatever, let's just go inside.
The remains of a church...
That mark... Zentopia?
What are those rocks for?
All of them have engravings on the surface...
Why don't we split up for now and look for anything that might be a part?
I'll look around the perimeter.
I'll check out the inside.
That mark...
These rocks are really suspicious.
Think I'll test them out...
What's this?
When the rocks are hit with magic, they move in the direction of their arrows.
But for what?
Do you know, Juvia-chan?
Juvia-chan thinks... Juvia told you to stop using chan with her name!
What?! Th-Then you don't mind if I address you casually?!
J-Juvia!
Morons... This isn't playtime!
Gray-sama is jealous! This is what Juvia's been waiting for!
We didn't come here to goof off! Think about what we should do with these rocks!
Right...
Don't scold Juvia-san!
Um... The Zentopia crest over there... Isn't there something a little strange about it?
Now that you mention it... It is a little off...
Far as I can recall, it should be more like this...
I see...
Maybe...
What are you gonna do?
Move the rocks...
You still don't get it?
So that's it!
You're slow on the uptake.
Right there?
Now all we need to do is hit these four arrows with magic at the same time...
Nothing's happening.
Wait...
Yes! You did it, Juvia!
Juvia is moved!
The light from our magic?
It's so bright!
Is it gonna throw somethin' else at us?
Hey... Is everyone okay?
Aye...
I'm alive, anyway...
I thought we were done for.
Where's Michelle?!
We'll pull her out on three!
Two... three!
Are you alright?!
So the entrance was under the desert, huh?
Scary!
Same as before. Magic doesn't work on it.
And this one doesn't seem to have a keyhole, huh?
When it comes to solving a puzzle like this, leave it to me!
It probably opens when you say the right magic words. I'll start with the cliche...
Open sesame!
Why sesame?
Alright then, open, sez me!
Hell if I know!
No, huh?
Then let's try using word combinations that are similar...
Sesame Street! Curry! Grilled fish! Caviar! Sesame sauce! Steak!
Boiled fish! Truffles! Sesame seed bun! Hamburger! Raw fish! Foie gras!
You say something too, Romeo!
Door, please open!
So we just had to be polite?
Huh? That's the mark of Zentopia.
I'll tell you,
these ruins are called the Sacred Graveyard.
It's written about in Zentopia history books and various other documents,
but its existence has never been proven.
Then...
We're the first ones here!
I see... This is what those old men were going on about...
It would be unbearable for them if this place were destroyed.
Like by Natsu...
Oh, shut up!
The door...
We're trapped in here?!
Don't panic.
If this were an adventure novel, at a time like this... we'd do this.
And then what would happen?
A hidden door would open!
Hey!
What are those things?!
G-Grotesque...
Huh?
Handsome couples?
Handsome how?!
This is totally a trap!
We're gonna get squished!
Bastards!
Don't!
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
What are you doing?!
It just seemed like the thing to do!
I've got it! If I move this back like it was...
Wait a second!
Th-That was close...
How are we going to get out of here?!
By turning this the opposite way! Maybe...
That's what it's for?
Hey!
This time from above?!
Huh?!
We got no other choice! Once more into the nostrils!
Look! This time, the nostrils are blocked off!
Any ideas?! Hey!
Talk about escaping from reality!
Punishment, is it?
Virgo!
Why are you in a swimsuit?!
Are you able to summon two at the same time now?!
I didn't summon her, she says.
But the princess is almost out of magic.
So... why the swimsuit?
Do you dislike young women in swimsuits?
Who cares?! Make a hole in the floor, she says.
Certainly!
It's the same thing over and over! she says.
Gray-sama...
Jeez... Wait'll you see where we got blown away to...
It seems we've been teleported here.
Are we meant to grow through that gate with all the arrow rocks?
Then the clock parts or whatever are at the end of it?
We can make a path with these rocks, right?
Probably...
But who thought up this roundabout crap?
Spicy!
Sugar Boy!
Yes, I am!
Thanks to Samuel, I figured out the entrance to the church right away,
but I didn't know how to get to this dimension...
I'm here thanks to you second-rate wizards!
He's the enemy, huh?
Bastard... You followed us?!
Once I get in there, I'll have no more use for you.
See, this is Zentopia territory, so I can guess where to find the part.
We're not letting you in there!
Spicy!
Suck your thumbs and observe!
Hey! Sit down, boys and girls!
Shit!
What the hell are you?!
This feels gross!
You two got caught?!
This is that asshole's magic!
That's right! I do Dog Whistle magic.
I can make these pretty hound dogs do whatever I want.
Dogs?!
All-righty! Time to say bye-bye.
Hold on! I'll freeze and shatter that junk!
Forget about us!
Please go after him, Gray-sama!
Alright...
If left alone, that gooey stuff saps your magic and your strength, so be careful!
Who are you talking to? We're both Ul's pupils. This is nothing.
I figured...
I wonder if you'll follow me...
I've had enough of your crap!
I'm gonna make you regret the hell out of ever makin' an enemy out of Fairy Tail!
I don't see any sign of Ice Boy. I guess he was just all talk...
Oh! Surprise! When did you get here?!
It wasn't easy, but I caught up to you.
You realized this gate goes around in a loop. Impressive.
All it took was a little observation.
It seems I need to have it out with you once and for all.
The result will be no different than in Edolas. I'm gonna kick your ass!
That?!
Wonderful!
You ain't gettin' it!
Why are you stripping?!
It's my thing!
It means I'm fired up, see.
You caught me off guard with that!
Unbelievable... W-Why...
Why is my heart going pitter-patter?
Huh? Where's Virgo?
Behind you...
What are you doing?!
Punishment, is it? she asks.
No... but why are you in there?
I feel calm in here, she says.
Looks like we're in another weird place.
Alright! Anyway, I say we keep goin'.
Princess, I repaired this for you.
Fleuve d'Etoile?!
Huh? It's just a normal whip now.
I upgraded it so it responds when you need it.
Wow! Thank you, Virgo!
And with that I will take my leave.
So she wants to crack the whip.
That's her character.
I can hear you!
Let's move on!
Aye!
The thing is, there's no door or anything!
Look at these statues!
Those are coffins, aren't they?
All of them?!
Maybe there's another hidden device...
I want to try touching them, but after what happened in that last room...
But isn't that human curiosity for you,
wanting to touch something even more when you know you shouldn't...
What the heck are you doing?!
That one resembles Gray, so the blood suddenly rushed to my head...
You're something else...
Is that the earth rumbling?
I think something's coming closer...
It looks like breaking the thing was the right answer!
I don't know about that...
Right answer, my ass!
Brilliant Blaze of the Fire Dragon!
Yep, it doesn't work!
When are you gonna learn?!
A bridge!
Three of them!
Maybe one of them is the real thing...
And the other two are dead ends, probably.
We don't got time to think it over! The right one!
Left!
The middle one!
Okay, Romeo-san! Who's correct?!
Um...
Michelle, with the middle bridge!
Hurry up!
Romeo was right!
W-Wait a second! What's that?!
From in front, too?!
I don't think it's gonna let us pass!
Between a rock and a hard rock, huh?!
Alright! We're gonna time this right an' then jump!
It's impossible!
We gotta do it!
Natsu-nii...
Happy, you pick up Lucy and Michelle!
Romeo, grab onto me!
I-I can do it myself!
Alright! Give it a shot!
Michelle, sure, but no way can I haul Lucy!
What are you tryin' to say?!
Here they come!
I did it!
You did awesome, Romeo!
My right arm's gonna rip off!
Enough already!
Romeo! Grab on with fire!
Alright!
Nee-san!
You can count on me!
I just got you back, but I need your help...
Fleuve d'Etoile!
Natsu! Romeo! Are you okay?!
Y-Yeah...
More or less...
So now what do we do?
Right now... the only way is down.
Down... At this height?
Get'im, li'l doggy! Yes!
Not so fast!
Oh, spicy! Or more like... cold!
Ice Make: Floor!
Hot!
Hot! Hot! Hot Boy, yes! Hot! Hot! Hot Boy, yes! Hot Boy, yes!
What?!
What the...?!
Gray-sama and the bad guy disappeared?!
No. My bet is they returned to our world. In which case...
If we don't jump into that light, too...
That's not bad either, really...
It's bad for Juvia!
Don't get mad. I was kidding.
Juvia is tired.
It's this magic that's doing it.
I don't think so...
Alright. Time to make a real effort...
You're in position to do Iced Shell?! Don't tell me...
Relax! I'm just gonna release some magic.
Focus on not getting caught up in its effect!
Okay.
You shattered it!
Let's go!
What's wrong?
Nothing! I need to get to Gray-sama quickly!
The exit is over there.
Gimme the part!
You'll have to pry it from my... cold... dead...
Let go and back off! Otherwise, I'll...
Yes! I love you, too!
What the hell are you talkin' about?! I mean, I'm not like that!
You're cold in both heart and soul, aren't you, Ice Boy?
In that case, I'll just have to
deliver my hot feelings... directly!
Hot!
Spicy, right?!
It's the property of fire I absorbed from Natsu-kun. I guess he was pretty cute, too...
This goop... ain't nothin'... I can't handle!
I love that expression! Come on, Ice Boy!
Gray! How long are you gonna let this goofball walk all over you?!
Get a hold of yourself! Don't bring shame on Ul!
Son of a bitch!
This wasn't the fault of Ul's magic! I was still just holdin' back!
Gray-sama! Together!
Let's go!
Like I said! You're gonna regret the hell out of ever makin' an enemy out of Fairy Tail!
Oh... beautiful...
I'm taking this.
And so... you're taking along my heart...?
What is this?
This is the lowest level of the graveyard...
It looks more like a town than a graveyard...
The gravekeeping priests lived here while they tended the graves.
They never went outside, but spent their whole lives here.
Or so the legend goes...
We gotta look for the part in this huge place?
Natsu-nii, can't you sniff it out?
It's the same as it was with the clock hand... I'm not really familiar with the smell.
Wait... No... This smell is...
I'm getting a chill. I have a bad feeling...
My hunch was right!
This kind of place is exciting, isn't it?
Hey, do you know why we came here?
To explore ruins, right?
What, are you playin' a video game?! If you have too much fun, I'll leave you behind!
It's rare for you to be serious. What's wrong?
I want our team to be the first ones to get there, don't you?!
Yeah! You're acting like it's a game, too, Natsu!
Next time: Footprints of the Myth!
This ain't no game! It's a showdown!
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm moving on, so stick with me so you don't get lost.
What're you treatin' me like a kid for?!
