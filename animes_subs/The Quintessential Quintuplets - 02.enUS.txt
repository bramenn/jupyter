Thanks for gathering here today.
I mean, this is our home...
I thought you would've given up by now.
Didn't I tell you that we don't need a tutor?
Then prove it to me.
Prove it?
I'll have you take this test.
I promise to never talk to anyone who passes.
U-Uesugi-san?
A test?
Why should I have to bother?
Fine.
I'll take it.
Itsuki, are you serious?
All I need to do is pass.
And then, I'll never have to see your face again.
Let's do this, guys!
Oh, fine.
What counts as a passing grade?
Sixtyno.
Make that fifty. That's good enough.
We don't really owe you this,
but you need to be taught not to underestimate us.
I'm done grading.
Amazing.
You all scored a 100!
Combined, that is.
Don't tell me you girls were...
Run for it!
These girls...
All five of them are potential flunkers!

Damn it...
I never would have thought...
balancing tutoring and my own studies...
would be so hard.
Barely made it.
I've never even seen an import like this.
It must be worth at least a million.
Wh-What?
Stop staring. It's rude.
Good morning!
You again?
Hey, Futaro-kun.
Running again?!
Look carefully.
I don't have anything on me.
Perfectly
Safe
I'm harmless.
You aren't fooling us!
He might try to teach us stuff once we've let down our guard.
What do you think I am?
I'll admit to our inadequacies.
But we'll solve our problems by ourselves.
We can study alone.
Exactly.
I see.
Then I assume you've reviewed the test.
Question 1: Name the warlord defeated by Mori Motonari at the Battle of Itsukushima.

Speechless
Speechless?
What I've realized is that these five girls utterly detest studying.
And...
They also hate me.

I'm just going to have to win the trust of each of them.
Huh?
Wait, Miku...
She got that question right.
Then why...
Miku?
Here's your barbecue beef com
Hey, Miku.
Having lunch right now?
Let's see, a 350 yen sandwich, and... Huh?
What's that drink?
Matcha Soda
Matcha soda.
Matcha?
I'm actually kind of curious what that'd taste like.
You're mean. I'm not letting you have any.
Can I ask you something?
About that question this morning...
Uesugi-san!
Yotsuba!
Sorry for running away this morning.
So, Miku...
Take a look at this!
My English homework.
I got all of the questions wrong.
Come on, you shouldn't get between them.
Huh? Between them?
You should have him help you study too, Ichika.
I think I'll pass.
You know, with us being stupid and all.
That doesn't mean you get to not study.
Besides, is it really a good idea to spend all your high school years studying?
We ought to be enjoying our youth more.
Falling in love and stuff.
Love...
That is the most foolish act of all, furthest removed from scholastic endeavors.
Love
Go ahead and fall in love if you'd like.
But if you do, you will peak in school.
Oh boy. He's too far gone.
I don't have anyone to go out with, even if I wanted to.
How about you, Miku?
Are there any guys you like?
N-No.
What's gotten into her?
That face...
As her sister, I can tell.
There's no mistake!
Miku's in love.
Miku's in love?
I need those girls to study.

Miku
What the...?
It's from Miku.
Come to the rooftop after school.
There's something I want to tell you.
I just can't hold it in any longer.
Me?!
Wait, a love letter?
Miku likes me?
But we only met three days ago!
What are you grinning about?
That's so creepy.
I'm not!
I'm not grinning!
This is a prank.
Stay cool, Uesugi Futaro.
I have zero reason to play along with this crap.
See?!
I fell for a cheap prank.
Not that it'd be okay if she actually...
Thank goodness.
You read my letter.
I wish I could've told you at the cafeteria.
But I didn't want anyone to hear this.
Huh?
I don't like where this is going.
Futaro...
Hey...
Miku's in love!
Uh, Miku...
I've been wanting to tell you...
I...?
I knew it was Sue Harukata!
Sue
Sue Harukata?
Sue Haru
Sue Harukata
There, I said it.
I feel better now.
T-Timeout!
What are you talking about?
This isn't some weird confession, is it?
Shut up already.
It's the answer to your question.
My question?
Question 1: Name the warlord defeated by Mori Motonari at the Battle of Itsukushima.
That one?
W-W-Wait!
Why are you answering that now?
S-Sorry!
Swift as the wind, silent as the woods
The Takeda crest?
Isn't that Takeda Shingen's...
Did you see it?
I did.
P-Please don't tell anyone.
I like Sengoku period warlords.
Akechi Mitsuhide
Takeda Shingen
Tokugawa Ieyasu

It started with a game I borrowed from Yotsuba.

During player's turn, movement speed is increased by 3 times.
I was fascinated by the ambitious warlords,
and I read lots of books, too.
But the guys the people in class like are all good-looking actors or models.
And I like bearded old guys.
I'm weird.
Yeah, she's weird all right.
It'd be all too easy to write her off as that.
But this is a golden opportunity.
It's not weird.
Have faith in what you like.
Speaking of which, I got a perfect score on my last History exam.
Really?
This is what the guy at the top of the grade is capable of.
Booyah
Take my lessons, and I'll teach you things about the warlords that you don't know.
Are you telling me you know more about them than I do?
Then, here's a question.
Blah Blah Blah
Nobunaga
It's commonly said that Nobunaga used to call Hideyoshi a monkey,
Monkey
Hideyoshi
but this is false.
What was his true nickname?
She won't stop talking!
So, Hideyoshi's nickname...
I think the History teacher mentioned it.
Bald rat?
Correct.
Thank you, Sensei!
There's a theory that Kenshin was actually a woman.
Yeah, totally.
Mitsunari never ate the persimmons.
Yeah, he totally didn't.
Apparently, Nobunaga put sake in a skull.
Y-Yeah, he totally did.
Warlords are the one thing linking History and Miku, who's running away from studies.
I'm going to make full use of them.
Oh, and...
I should head home.
I want to talk some more, though.
I bet you'd love to hear this one.
I know!
Let's focus on Japanese history for our next tutoring session.
Will you take it, Miku?
If you insist.
Fine.
Victory is mine.
I just need to find a spot for us to study.
The rest will be easy.
My livelihood depends on this.
Don't take this personally.
Wait.
A token of my goodwill.
Try it.
Matcha Soda
You said you were curious.
It'll be fine.
It doesn't have snot in it.
Just kidding.
Wait, did she just say snot?
What is she talking about?
Huh?
Do you not know this story?
I see.
You said you were smart, but you're all talk, huh?
I doubt I have anything to learn from you.
Bye-bye.
Reception
I'd like to borrow all of these.
O-Okay.
All talk?
How dare she?!
I'll teach her, whether she likes it or not!
Miku, I've been waiting for you.
What do you want, Futaro?
Fight me.
What?
You like Sengoku trivia, don't you?
I'll answer all of your questions this time.
No.
I'll be waiting at the west gate. Uesugi Futaro
You never learn, do you?
Are you afraid of being beaten at your only skill?
In Takeda Shingen's Furin Kazan,
what does the wind represent?
That's easy.
The answer is,
swift as the wind.
Damn her!
She fled again!
That's right.
They keep running away.
From me, and from studying.
She's not getting away anymore.
Whoa, Uesugi-san.
Y-Yotsuba?
You should watch where you're going.
Have you seen Miku?
She ran that way.
Thanks.
Damn it, where'd she go?
Whoa, Uesugi-san.
Y-Yotsuba?
You should watch where you're going.
Uh...
Sorry, Yotsuba.
Stay calm and hear me out.
Your doppelganger is over there.
You're right!
It's me!
You're dead.
I don't want to die!
What should I eat for my last meal?
Huh?
Is it just me, or is that Yotsuba's hair kind of long?
She took her ribbon off, too.
And she put on headphones.
It's Miku!
Thank goodness.
You tricky little brat!
I'm sorry for deceiving you the other day!
I spent the past two days
going through every book about the Sengoku period in the library.
Liar.
So, anyway...
Huh?!
I have confidence that I can talk to you as an equal now!
Warlord shiritori.
Ryuzoji Takanobu.
Bu?
Fu counts, too, right?
Fukushima Masanori.
Famous for being the most prominent of the Seven Spears of Shizugatake.
Kanamori Nagachika.
Ka...
Kawajiri Hidetaka.
Katakura Kojurou.
Uesugi Kagekatsu.
Tsu... Tsuda Nobuzumi.
Mi... Miyoshi Nagayoshi.
Shi... Shimazu Toyohisa.
Sa... Sanada Yukimura.
I can't keep this up.
Ra...
Why are you so desperate?
I didn't think you could keep up with me.
Not bad.
Uh, I was the slowest runner in my class.
So hot.
I-I'm thirsty.
Jeez, does she not have any shame?
Here.
Sorry.
You like this, don't you?
110 yen is money I'd rather not spend,
but there's no snot in it, of course.
That's from the anecdote about Ishida Mitsunari
Ishida Mitsunari
Otani Yoshitsugu
drinking tea with Otani Yoshitsugu's snot in it, right?
You wouldn't believe how many books I read to find that story.
Although, in the end,
Yotsuba happened to be there, so she looked it up on her phone for me.
Yotsuba?
Did you tell Yotsuba that I like warlords?
No, I didn't.
Do you need to keep it a secret from your sisters, too?
I can't tell them because they're my sisters.
Why not?
Of the five of us, I'm the biggest loser.
You're doing great, compared to the rest of them.
You scored the highest on that last exam, too.
You're so nice, Futaro.
A-Although that's still not saying much.
I can kind of tell, though.
The other four can do anything I can.
We're quintuplets, after all.
Hang on.
If what Miku says is true...
So just give up on me, and...
My job is to tutor the five of you.
I'm going to make sure you and the others all study.
I'm going to have the five of you graduate together with smiles on your faces.
Say what you want, but it's not happening.
The five of us can only score a 100 combined.
Yeah.
It's totally impossible.
Or so I thought, until today.
But now I'm confident, after what you just said.
You're quintuplets.
That means anything you can do, the other four can, too.
Flip that around, and anything the other four can do,
you can, too.
Take a look at this.
The exam results from last time.
Do you notice anything?
None of us got the same answers right.
Yup.
You're still all problem students with an average grade of 20.
But I see hope in this.
What any one of you can do, all of you can do.
Ichika, Nino, Yotsuba, and Itsuki.
And you, too, Miku.
I believe that all of you have the potential to score a 100 on your own.
Say what?
That's BS.
Seriously.
You're placing too much faith in the quintuplets thing.
If only the other four were as positive as you are.
I did call them, but...
It's not the other four, though.
It's the other three. Right, Miku?
Hey!
You came... did... you?
Sengoku Warlord Exam Problems
You put this idea in my head, Futaro.
That maybe...
Uesugi Futaro
Uesugi Futaro
Just maybe, I can do a little bit better, too.
Uesugi Futaro
So...
You'd better take responsibility.
I got this.
Eureka
Is it Uesugi-san that you like?
No way.
Huh?
Next Time on The Quintessential Quintuplets
Quintuplet Trivia!
Who has the best grades of the five of us?
Miku!
The brains of the quintuplets.
The strategist.
What's a strategist?
Someone who used their intellect to plan for Sengoku battles.
She won't stop talking!
