Piercing through the Macro sky,
a thunderbolt strikes the Earth
To awaken us, the young mankind,
the Light struck
Macross! Macross!
The brave youths who arise
and fight to protect their loved ones
will set out on their journey as the war rages on
Will you love me tomorrow?
Slicing through the darkness, they fly toward
that blue planet that shines in the distance
Macross! Macross!
Macross!
It is the year 2009.
The alien spacecraft that fell to Earth ten years before
has been reborn as the gigantic battleship Macross.
However, on the day that the Macross was scheduled to be launched,
its automatic defense system of alien origin suddenly activated itself,
firing the main cannon and destroying an unidentified warship.
Humanity was plunged into unavoidable conflict.
Meanwhile, Lynn Minmay, a young girl attending the launch ceremony,
have also found themselves in the midst of the battle.
SPACE FOLD
At this moment, the Macross is making its way into space.
Hikaru!
Hikaru!
I guess the shock was a little too much for him.
This is Skull Leader.
I left something on South Ataria Island, and I'm going back to get it.
Have some other squadron fly escort for the Macross.
What are you picking up?
Well... Valkyrie VT-102 and its pilot.
VT-102?
Now that you mention it, there was something strange about that pilot.
You think so, too, huh? Well, it's not so surprising...
A civilian?!
Oh, no!
No way!
This isn't something I'd want a girl to have to see...
What's wrong?
You look like you're shaking.
What? What is it?
Don't look!
What? Why not?
Just don't look!
Hey, Hikaru!
How long do you plan on staying here goofing off?
Aliens have the hots for you, huh? Talk about bad luck!
It can do that, too?
What's going on?
Handy, huh?
This is control. We are now engaging main thrusters.
Prepare for retrieval of Valkyrie squadrons. All units, move into landing positions.
This is Mountain Three. Following landing line.
You're cleared to land.
Hayase, is the Valkyrie retrieval completed?
Just a moment, sir.
All that's left is Major Focker and the civilian pilot in VT-102.
Knowing Focker, there's nothing to worry about.
Vanessa, where are ARMD-I and ARMD-II?
They're nearly at the rendezvous point and currently decelerating.
I estimate contact in 20 minutes.
Very good.
Claudia, how are we doing?
Right on schedule, sir.
But it's strange, isn't it, Captain?
If the enemy fleet can launch that kind of attack from orbit,
then why aren't they firing on us now?
So, that's bothering you too?
Yes, sir.
They may be toying with us.
You can't be serious! Toying with us?!
It's just a feeling.
Pay it no mind.
You've got to be kidding! I'm not going to go to the Macross!
Idiot! If you take her back to the island, you'll be risking her life!
And you call yourself a man?!
Um, my aunt and uncle are on the island in the shelter.
If they're in the shelter, they'll be fine! Even if this does turn into an all-out war.
But I really would like to go back to the island...
Once the fighting's over, I'll take you back personally.
That is what really worries me!
Well, what he means is...
This is Skull Leader!
Did you find what you'd left behind?
Yeah, the enemy had him scared so bad, he was falling over himself!
I was not!
So, this is the civilian?
That would explain why he didn't know anything.
Hey, what's with the old lady?
Old lady?!
She's the flight control officer of the Macross.
So, even Hikaru thinks she looks like an old lady?
Major Focker! I will expect a thorough explanation
as to why you let a civilian board VT-102.
Ooh, scary!
And you, Mr. Ichijo! This isn't over for you by a long shot!
What's her problem?
Maybe you should just apologize. People like her can be pretty scary.
I'm comin' in!
Requesting instructions...old lady!
Roger. We'd appreciate it if you didn't kill yourself when you land.
Retrieval of Reguld platoons is now in progress.
Only half of them are unharmed?
Yes, sir.
What's the enemy ship doing?
It's currently ascending through the planet's upper atmosphere.
They appear be trying to rendezvous with the space fleet from earlier.
Orders, sir?
It would be simple to shoot them down, but that ship interests me.
If they enter orbit, there's a possibility they will execute a fold and escape.
Yes, I know.
We'll have to launch a containment attack before they can join up with the others.
All ships, prepare to fire!
But why do you have to kill each other?
That's what war is.
I just can't understand the military...
You did some shooting yourself, though, didn't you?
I never imagined something like that could be inside.
Something like that...
Huh? Something like what?
What?
Hang on!
Well, here we are.
Sempai! What's wrong with you?!
Sempai!
Thank you, Sempai!
Well, I mean, if we left something like this on the battlefield,
it would just get in the way. So I, uh, had it stashed away.
This is the plane from the air show this morning, isn't it?
Rendezvous with ARMD-I and ARMD-II is complete.
Now moving into docking position. All hands to emergency stations.
Well, I've got work to do.
You two, stay right here. If you start wandering around, you'll get lost.
This ship is massive.
Now moving into docking alignment.
The enemy fleet appears to be regrouping.
Very well. Fire a barrage between the fleet and the battleship!
I don't care about the smaller ships, but do NOT hit that battleship.
Understood! Firing will now commence!
Target the enemy fleet! Aim wide of the battleship!
An attack?!
Yes, sir. It's coming from the same orbit as before. Range: 12,000 km.
ARMD-I has been destroyed, along with the Miranda and the Akishima.
Three ships at once? How much damage did we take?
We've taken no direct hits.
All sections show green.
What's our position?
Sir. We've almost completed a single orbit.
South Ataria Island is 800km ahead.
Our current altitude is 120km.
Claudia, make it look like we're going to land at South Ataria,
then initiate a sub-space transfer.
You mean the Fold System, sir? But, we haven't tested it yet!
It's definitely a risk.
But, if we just sit here, we'll be destroyed.
But sir, it's an alien system!
We can't just give up without trying!
Put the sub-space transfer,
I mean, the Fold System on standby!
Our target will be the far side of the Moon!
Check coordinates, then execute fold directly above the island.
You mean, near the surface?
The enemy won't see it coming.
But, shouldn't we get authorization from UN High Command?
This is an emergency. We'll contact them after we've reached the Moon.
But, sir!
Enough! That's an order!
Yes, sir!
Fold System, stand by.
All hands to emergency stations.
Power system check shows all green. Focusing power.
All hands to emergency stations! All hands to emergency stations!
This is not a drill.
The ship will execute a fold in five minutes.
It sure has gotten quiet, hasn't it?
I wonder if it's all over.
That's some ruckus, wouldn't you say?
This sure turned into one hell of a launch ceremony...
I have no idea how much damage we took.
I wonder if our shops are all right.
Who knows...
What happened to Minmay?
She hasn't come back yet.
There are plenty of other places she could've escaped to.
There's nothing to worry about.
That girl's pretty sharp about some things, you know?
You're really leaving?
You want to go back, too, don't you?
But...
Look, I won't force you or anything.
Ship is ready for fold.
T-minus three minutes to fold.
I wonder what that means.
Dunno. Anyway, we're leaving, so it's got nothing to do with us.
This is just a one-seater, isn't it?
We'll be fine. Go on, hop in.
Put this on.
Okay.
Can't you even put on a helmet straight?
Hold on tight.
To what?
I can't see my instruments!
Sorry!
You shouldn't let a little something like this scare you!
See?
Yeah, you're right.
T-minus ten seconds to fold.
Nine... Eight...
Seven... Six...
Five... Four...
Three... Two...
One... Zero!
Initiate fold!
What's going on?!
Wh...What?!
They're executing a fold near the surface?!
Is that even possible?
I do not know.
Locate their de-fold point at once!
Yes, sir!
What happened?
Switching to backup systems.
Captain, I'm picking up an object below the ship.
Of course you are. We're at the far side of the Moon.
It's much smaller than that, sir. I'll put it on screen.
The object is closing in!
What?
No, the ship is moving toward it.
Claudia, full reverse! Hurry!
I'm trying, but there's no response!
This is an emergency! All hands, brace for impact!
We're floating!
It's so pretty!
Wow!
Oh, man. The propeller's useless.
It's no use.
We must really be in outer space.
Is this space?
Is that what it looks like to you?
Huh? What's that?
Well, it's not an alarm clock, that's for sure.
I can't tell her that we're leaking air.
Let's go back.
Hey, don't get so worked up.
I sure hope the booster works.
Here we go.
Okay.
We're moving.
I think this'll work!
Now then, where's the Macross?
All right!
Here goes!
Oh, no! We can't get in!
What?!
Perfect!
The remaining enemy forces appear to have been destroyed.
What's the status on the evacuees in the shelter?
They're being brought on board.
Fortunately, there don't seem to be many dead or wounded.
That's good to hear. Hayase!
Sir.
Have you been able to contact UN High Command?
Shammy?
I've called and called, but...
No response, huh? And it's not a malfunction?
No. Um, sir? About our current location...
You've pinpointed our location? Where are we?
We're just inside the orbit of Pluto.
What?!
Pluto? It can't be!
I said we shouldn't have tried to fold.
Captain...
Captain!
Now, now, hold on. There's no need to worry.
If we made it this far out, we can just fold again and go back.
Really, sir?
What is it?
But...!
Fine. I'm on my way.
Captain?
It looks like the Fold System has completely disappeared.
Disappeared? You can't be serious!
It's gone?
But why?!
But that means we can't go back!
It looks like we're in for a long trip.
Hikaru and Minmay's joy at being saved is short-lived.
Ironically, the section of the Macross that they have flown into
has been sealed off from the rest of the giant ship.
Not a single person knows where they are.
With no means of escaping their forced confinement,
Hikaru and Minmay must watch as time ticks cruelly away.
LYNN MINMAY
I won't follow it anymore,
the shadow you cast as you run away
We all keep running until the end,
but we still can't see the goal
What awaits us after today?
What awaits us beyond tomorrow?
Even now, I keep running toward
the light that shines so far away
