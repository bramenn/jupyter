You're alive, Ichika.
I knew the whole time.
Are you okay?
You're not hurt, are you?
I'm not hurt.
Why are you here?
Did you come to see me
I was looking for you!
Do you know how worried we were after you went missing?
Missing?
How am I...?
You sent out a distress signal, didn't you?
Huh?
Th-That was an accident.
Then why was the signal lost from the unmanned pod...
S-Some things kind of happened...
Uh, that was me.
I thought Senpai... I mean, Ichika-san, was in danger...
So I...
Who are you?
I'll introduce him to you.
This is Kaito Kirishima-kun.
He's my, um...
Boyfriend... kinda...
N-Nice to meet you.
Wh-Wha...
What were you thinking, Ichika?!
U-Um...
Not only are you interacting with the locals,
but now you've got a boyfriend?! What the hell?!
You know Federation law, right?
That hurts...
You know what it says, right?
You're interacting with Kaito-kun, too...
I came here to save you!
This was an emergency!
I had an emergency, too...
Do you realize how worried your family has been?!
You don't get what's going on, do you?!
It hurts...
Remon-senpai, you're late.
I was thinking too much about how the story should continue.
Where are Ichika and Kirishima-kun?
They haven't come yet.
I wonder if they got the time wrong.
Tanigawa-san, sorry to ask, but could you go take a look?
I'll introduce myself properly this time.
I'm Emika Takatsuki, Ichika's older sister.
I'm Kaito Kirishima.
Kirishima-kun, right?
Thank you for taking Ichika in after she'd been in an accident.
I thank you on behalf of our family.
Oh, it was nothing.
I'm sorry for all the trouble.
I'll be taking Ichika back myself.
Huh?!
Onee-chan!
A distress call was received from a remote planet...
And contact was lost with the unmanned pod that went to save you.
Ichika, they haven't just declared you a crash victim, they've labeled you missing.
Do you know how worried we were when we heard that?
All our relatives are talking about it.
What?
So I took a paid vacation,
rented the latest ship,
and came out here to do my best to find you.
And what do I find?
I was so worried, and you're just living here without a care in the world,
and you even have a boyfriend.
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't think people would make such a big deal about it...
U-Um, Onee-san!
I think I might like the sound of that.
It's not bad to have a younger guy call you that once in a while.
Now that you know Ichika-san is safe,
there shouldn't be a problem anymore, right?
That's true!
They've already formed a search party.
Huh?
But if you report back that I'm safe...
You were designated missing on a planet
that's a grade F on the industrial scale,
where interaction with the locals is forbidden.
From the Federation's point of view,
I'm sure they'd want to verify the situation as quickly as possible.
If they found you and found out what you've been doing,
you would be arrested and taken into custody on the spot.
You would be prosecuted in accordance with Federation law.
But...
Is there anything we can do to stop that?
That's why I'm here.
Ichika, you'll be coming back with me before things get out of hand.
No way...
I don't want to.
I'm not going to leave Kaito-kun.
I never will.
If you stay here, you'll cause problems for Kirishima-kun and the rest of the planet.
I haven't done anything wrong.
That's not the problem here.
Why can't you understand?!
Senpai, calm down.
Let's listen to what your sister has to say,
and then we'll figure out what
There's only one choice.
Ichika, you already understand the situation, right?
Rinon!
Senpai!
Senpai...
I'm sorry, Kirishima-kun.
You had to see something that wasn't exactly pleasant.
It's okay...
Takatsuki... senpai...
Tani...
What are you doing?
We're supposed to be filming... already...
Why aren't you wearing any shoes?
Senpai?
Uh...
Does Sen I mean,
Ichika-san...
Must she return home?
She must.
Could she go back home and then come back here again?
Given the situation, I imagine that would be difficult.
Then...
Then could you take me into space with you?!
I'll do anything!
My sister's not very elegant and she's stubborn.
Are you sure about that?
Yes!
Let's... get a change of scenery, shall we?
Y-You're going back?
They're already looking for me.
And I couldn't get away from them if I tried.
I don't think they'd listen to what I had to say, either.
So you can't do anything about it?
No.
And if I try to stay here, things are going to get really bad.
So I have to...
So you're just going to leave?
You're going to leave Kaito-kun behind and go back to space?
But I can't do anything about
So you're going to give up on being with the guy you like?!
So you dated Kaito-kun knowing that you'd just give up,
knowing that your feelings for him weren't really that strong.
Do you know...
Do you know how I've felt?
Tanigawa-san...
Just do whatever you want!
Just give up already, leave him, and go back to space or whatever!
This planet is nice...
There's so much nature left.
My planet doesn't look a thing like it,
but it still feels like I've been here before.
Ichika-san said the same thing.
She said that there's an image of a place in her head,
and it's somewhere on this planet.
That's why she came to this planet.
That image is inside me, too.
That image is probably...
And now we've inherited that.
Why would they do that?
Who knows?
Maybe that's where they buried a bunch of treasure or something?
I didn't really care that much about it,
but it may have been on Ichika's mind this whole time.
When I looked for Ichika, I scanned this whole planet,
but there was no place here like the one I have in my head.
I know you said you want to go into space with us,
but there's no way I can take someone from a...
This planet would first have to develop the technology for interstellar flight,
make contact with us, join the Galactic Federation,
and then what you want could happen.
For that to happen, this planet would probably require...
Is there... Is there another way?
Unless Federation law was amended somehow, it's just not possible.
Thank you, Kirishima-kun.
You care about Ichika so much.
But...
I'm going to take Ichika back home.
It's for her own good.
I never thought she'd get a boyfriend.
I only came here to get her.
I never thought I'd have to do this instead.
You're Ichika Takatsuki-san's sister, correct?
Who's there?!
Kanna hasn't come back yet.
Remon-senpai went somewhere, too.
And what are Kai and Ichika-senpai doing?
I hope he's not fooling around while we're supposed to be filming.
Might be kind of lucky for me, though.
You think so?
Yep.
What are you talking about?
Kanna.
Wh-Where are Kai and Ichika-senpai?
I don't know.
What's wrong, Kanna?
Takatsuki-senpai said she's going back to space.
Someone's come to take her back.
What?
She said some stuff's going on.
She has no choice.
So we're not making the movie anymore.
There's no point in being here any longer, so let's go home!
W-Wait a second, Kanna.
What?
Does Takatsuki-senpai really want to go back to space?
I don't...
What about Kai?!
Are you okay with this?
She's going to go and leave Kai behind.
Are you okay with all of this?
Are you really okay with all of this?!
Of...
Of...
Of course not!
I was talking to your sister until just a little while ago.
I asked her to take me into space with you, but she said no.
I'm not going to give up...
on finding a way to stay with you.
Tanigawa-san got mad at me.
Huh? Why?
Senpai, you aren't...
Rinon, jump me...
Se
Senpai!
I don't think so.
Senpai, aren't you giving up a little too quickly?
Tetsuro...
Kitahara-san...
We heard what was going on, so we came here.
We couldn't just let you go like that.
I-It'd be a problem for us.
I mean, if you left, we wouldn't be able to film the movie anymore.
Tanigawa-san...
I want you to stay here.
Me, too.
B-But...
Kirishima-kun's here.
But...
Say how you really feel!
What do you really want?!
I don't want to go...
I don't want to return home...
I don't want to leave him...
I love Kaito-kun.
I love you, too!
I want to stay with you!
I don't care if all of outer space is against me!
Kaito-kun...
Then that's what you should do!
Thank you...
So what are you going to do?
Are you going to run?
Are you going to hide somewhere?
Th-That's...
Seems like you have a problem on your hands.
Remon?
I have some good news for you.
Episode 11 Don't go, Senpai.
Senpai can stay here on Earth?!
That's right.
There's a low probability this will actually work, however.
But it's not zero.
What do we have to do?
Ichika, you were searching for the image you had in your head, right?
Yes...
Then that means there's a possibility...
B-But that's just something I saw in my head...
Reference Room
Senpai's sister said that she also has an identical image in her head,
but she also said there wasn't any place like that on Earth.
Leaving behind an image like that is a rather complex piece of work.
They may have used some method to make it impossible to find...
Then how can we find it?
We can try comparing the data you've gathered...
I get it.
If there's a place on the map that's not in her data,
then that means...
Remon, how did you figure that out?
Someone gave me some advice.
You mean...
Onee-chan...
I was being so selfish, but you still...
Thank your friend, Ichika.
There's not much time. Get to work.
Right!
If we can find that location,
and find something that proves Earthlings and aliens have come in contact before...
Then Earth will lose its status as an F on the industrial scale.
If we can find that before the search party arrives...
Senpai, we only have to look at areas in Japan, right?
Yeah, judging by the plants and surroundings in the image I have,
I think we can limit our search to just Shinshu.
We're going to find it!
Yeah!
Something's coming... from the right...
You should sleep a little bit, too, Kai.
But we don't know when they'll come for Senpai.
Then I'll tell you something to help you stay awake.
Something?
I told Kanna I liked her the other day.
No way!
You What?!
I knew how she'd respond, though.
That's why you told me about Tanigawa...
I was thinking too much about myself.
So I don't want you to end up the same way.
Tetsuro...
Also, Mio told me she liked me when we went to Okinawa.
Seriously?
Seriously.
After I got into high school, I hadn't really been doing anything,
so I was thinking I wanted to at least do something,
and I guess a lot of things happened, after all.
Yeah, especially after Senpai came, right?
This summer's unbelievable.
Yeah, I mean, we're talking about...
I can't really do anything else,
but I hope you find it, Ichika.
The place you're looking for,
and your future...
When did I...
You can sleep a little bit longer.
We're already up.
You wanna sleep in my lap?
No, I...
Why are you guys acting so lovey-dovey?
I-I wasn't trying to...
Yeah, I wasn't...
What?!
I-I found it!
This place hasn't been checked!
All right!
Senpai.
Right.
Ichika, can you hear me?
Onee-chan?
The search party is close to the planet.
You need to hurry
Onee-chan!
Senpai!
Rinon, hurry up and jump us to that location!
Rinon?
What's wrong?!
What?
There's a linkage anti-field?
Deployed over the entire planet?
We can't teleport?
What should we do?
It'll take three hours to get there by train.
There's someone coming after her, right?
We have to hurry.
What's going on?
There's no one driving?
It's me.
Remon-senpai?!
I thought this might happen,
so I'm glad I got a car ready.
Senpai, you have a license?
Yes, most of them.
Most of them?
Who's going to be coming after you?
I wonder what else she has...
Probably another rescue pod like before.
Ichika, they're going to come after you by scanning for your biological data, right?
Yeah, but why do you know that?
Put this on.
It'll reduce the biological responses you're giving off.
Also...
These devices.
When you turn them on,
they'll transmit biological data identical to Ichika's.
Remon...
Did you also get those from...?
That's right...
I had your sister's help.
Onee-chan...
All right, let's keep heading towards
It's creaking!
I-It can't be...
It's coming after us!
It's making another pass!
Ishigaki-kun.
Got it.
Me, too!
I'm going, too!
Mio!
Let me go with you.
Tetsuro!
Make it there, Kai!
Good luck!
Mio, turn it on!
Okay!
Come on, come after us.
Bingo!
Tetsuro!
Mio!
What is it?
You wanna go see a movie sometime?
Huh?
Without Kanna or Kai!
Just the two of us!
Yeah, let's go!
Remon-senpai, take Route 70.
We have a little bit more than ten kilometers to go.
Behind us!
There's more of them!
I'll go.
Tanigawa-san!
I'm not doing this for you.
I'm doing it for the person I like!
I want the person I like to keep smiling.
Tanigawa!
I'm going to make you regret this three years from now!
Be happy, jerk!
It doesn't look like anything else is coming.
Kirishima-kun, take this.
It's my camera.
What are we going to do?
Isn't it obvious?
We're going to film.
The heroine evades her pursuers' attacks and heads toward her destination.
Seems like we'll be able to film a pretty nice climax.
And we'll leave the epilogue up to God.
That's the best part of making a movie.
I'm ready here!
And... action!
Persistent, aren't we?
Wh-What's up with this car?!
Episode 12 Waiting there, in the summer.
We won't forget...
No matter how much time passes...
We'll be...
