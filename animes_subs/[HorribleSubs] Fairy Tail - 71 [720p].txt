Gray!
If you've really betrayed Fairy Tail, then you must have some reason!
No reason.
Nothin' like that.
What?
Gray...
Yes-yes-yes!
And now all my research has come to fruition, and I have completed my Dragonoid!
Shouldn't you people be singing my praises or something?
Is that the voice of this Daphne person?
Give us Natsu back this instant!
Sorry, but no can do.
I'm sure you realize that my Dragonoid here moves by sucking out Natsu Dragneel's magic power.
Sucking out my magic power?
Friendship will overcome the dead.
Until I've sucked out all that magic power,
I ain't givin' Natsu Dragneel back!
To a wizard, one's magic power is their very life!
Give back Natsu now!
So, what are we going to do?
At this rate...
Screw this!
Yes-yes-yes...
As long as you keep up the good work,
we'll be fully charged in no time.
Then, my Dragonoid will be operational for half an eternity!
You want to get in her way? Just try it.
Although even with your powers combined,
I highly doubt you can hold out long enough to see it fully charged.
Gray...
I've heard of a dangerous, dragon-crazed wizard who was trying to create an artificial dragon...
Is that you?
Such slanderous rumors... So far from the truth.
They should say the genius scientist Daphne succeeded in creating an artificial dragon.
Artificial dragon?
Could it be...
The egg remains I found back then...
It was truly a long struggle for me to perfect it.
It all started with the first step: Successfully hatching an artificial dragon from an egg.
The city I lived in was the perfect place to gather data, or so I thought.
But the people who come from my city can all use Hidden, see.
Unable to experiment on the city, I had no more use for it.
Yes-yes-yes! If you like playing hide-and-go-seek so much...
As punishment, I made it so they could not dispel their Hidden.
I also punished the incomplete dragons who were unable
to sense the people who had vanished with their Hidden.
Back then? When I went to that city...
That voice...
Is that Igneel?
Wait! Answer me!
Igneel!
After that, I left the city.
Igneel, where are you?
Igneel!
Ever since then, it became known as the City without Sound.
I continued my research, and finally it dawned on me.
I needed the power of a Dragon Slayer to activate the Dragonoid.
Yes-yes-yes, Natsu Dragneel!
Salamander!
Keep working until you drop dead!
For me, and my evil ambitions!
Get fired up!
What are you doing? That's dangerous!
Looks like it's not just big, it's also gonna be seriously tough!
Aye...
You fiend!
What are you planning to do by creating such a thing?
Yes-yes-yes.
My great ambition is to complete the perfect Dragonoid!
Even this is nothing more than a prototype.
First up, we have to test its current ability! Test!!
Lower half's mobility is sub-par, I see. Yes-yes.
Walking is impossible, say?
She's trouble! She's really big trouble!
Ooh, I know! She's what they call a Mad Scientist!
We must stop it somehow.
But...
With Natsu-san inside, we can't just attack carelessly!
Oh, does it really matter?
Carla!
Gray...
Is this what you wished for?
Gray, you bastard!
You've gone and done it this time!
As I am a Man, I will bring you back to the guild!
Don't think ill of me.
This is Master's orders.
That master?
Yeah. Looks like he got word of Daphne.
He's decided to ask Gray how to get rid of that giant thing.
Erza!
Wait... Don't tell me... It's...
It's flying!
Flying? That's so unfair!
Like you can complain.
Oh, no... It's heading straight for Magnolia!
How dare she...
It's already too late for anyone to stop my Dragonoid.
Lucy and the rest of you return to the guild and get everyone mobilized.
We'll protect Magnolia, everyone.
But, what would happen to...
I will stop that Dragonoid!
Understood.
Let's go, Happy!
Aye, sir!
Gray... What could it be?
I will do all that I can.
You deal with Gray, okay?
Aye, sir!
And you take care of Natsu,'kay?
Your word as a Man!
Leave him to me.
Stop!
That thing again?
His name is Lizardman.
Requip!
An artificial creature that mimics people's attributes?
Even if you have the same attributes as I, you don't carry the same burdens!
Yes-yes... Good for you.
But how about this?
I've made sure to take careful records of the previous battle's data.
You'll soon find out the power of my Lizardmen v. 2.5!
Titania... Erza Scarlet!
What the hell?
Everyone okay?
Yeah, somehow.
I see. These are the spiky fellows Erza talked about.
Came to take Gray back, have we?
Looks more like they're here to wipe us all out!
A Man will repel the enemy!
This'll be fun!
Let's rumble!
Here I come!
Man!
Don't panic! Take shelter in Fairy Tail!
Everyone! This way!
So that's the Dragon-thing that Lucy mentioned?
The city's gonna be destroyed at this rate!
We can't guarantee that the guild will be safe, either...
Does the master know about this?
He went to gather everyone from the guild.
The bunch that went to capture Gray ain't come back either!
What the heck is going on?
Elfman...
Man, what a hard head!
Beast Arm... Iron Bull!
Smoke Rush!
That's a Smoke Fake?
That's my magic!
Damn it... I've lost my touch... I'm sorry.
Wakaba!
You're not gettin' him back!
He's heavy...
Damn it all... Were you really working with them behind the scenes, Gray?
I've been saved by Natsu countless times...
When I screwed up on a job...
Ever since he was a kid, he had a smart mouth,
and never thought about consequences to his actions.
But...
But... Even so...
For shame, Gray...
For a Man, what matters is how he takes responsibility!
And I'll see to it that Gray takes responsibility for this!
Take Over: Beast Soul!
Yes-yes-yes...
What a beautiful city.
I'm getting chills up my spine just thinking about how fun it'll be to pulverize it!
So sit there in your box seat and watch the fireworks!
Assuming you even have the strength to do that...
Damn it... I can't move...
Natsu... Natsu, the Dragon Slayer...
That voice...
I know I've heard it somewhere...
Young man.
Huh? The pot's talking?
We are the people who live in this city.
How do you do?
You're just a shadow!
No, no...
Because of a magic called Hidden, you can't see our bodies anymore!
Huh? I don't get it.
Then just undo the magic, right?
We called out to you because we can't do that.
Who are you?
Me?
I'm a Fairy Tail Wizard! I'm the Dragon Slayer, Natsu!
What?! A Dragon Slayer? Seriously?
I ain't gonna lie.
And you don't have to be that surprised.
Natsu... Natsu, the Dragon Slayer.
Please, rid us of this magic curse!
Sure, I guess...
What should I do?
Like destroy the wall?
No. You must defeat the one who controls dragons.
Huh? What are you blabbing about?
No one can control a dragon! Are you nuts?
But if there is someone like that, I'll beat'em.
Will you promise?
Yeah. It's a promise.
Then, we'll wait.
We will place our hopes with you.
We will always be waiting...
Huh?
Hey!
Where'd you go?
I thought it was a dream or something, so I'd completely forgotten.
Defeat the one who controls dragons...
Crap... So this is what they meant?
Well, I promised, didn't I?!
Natsu Dragneel's power's grown higher than my data!
At this rate, my Dragonoid will go into overdrive!
What was that?
Natsu...
I ain't gonna lose!
Yes-yes-yes...
At times like this, if I calmly and meticulously
keep sucking up your magic at a reasonable pace, then AOK.
Yes-yes, excellent work. Thank you for the lovely magic power!
Damn it...
Give me a break here!
We've got trouble! Elfman and the others came back, but...
Elfman!
Take Wakaba and Macao to the back!
See to them!
Are you okay? What happened?
Nee-chan... Take it from here... Save Natsu!
He's...
I'm sorry... I...
I killed Lisanna...
I should have brought you with us!
Then this wouldn't have...
Quit it already!
Stop bawling all over yourself!
If you keep moping around like that forever,
that ain't gonna make Lisanna smile, will it?
Lisanna...
She was always smiling, no matter what.
She was smiling until the very end.
I'm sure that's the way she was! That's Lisanna!
It's the sad times when she smiled even more!
Isn't that what they call being a man?!
A Man...
Okay. Leave Natsu to me.
Elfman!
I'll heal him with my Sky Magic!
Please, Wendy.
Hey! You awake, Gray?
Tell us what the hell's going on here!
If you don't, I'll...
Please, stop!
There is no way that Gray-sama has betrayed Fairy Tail!
Juvia believes in him!
No matter what people say... Even if the whole world turned against him!
Juvia...
Enough, Juvia.
You're takin' me to Gramps, right?
I don't think we have time to kill.
Follow me.
We're making sure you don't try anything funny.
Juvia...
Gray-sama...
Elfman!
He should be fine now.
Wendy!
Wendy!
I'm okay... I have to cure Wakaba-san and Macao-san soon, or...
Stop it! If you use any more Sky Magic, your own life will be at risk!
I don't care!
Well, you should!
I want to help everyone!
Then I can really be a member of Fairy Tail!
Sheesh, you're so stubborn...
Everyone, please work together and save Natsu!
Yeah. We all owe Natsu, big time.
Yeah. When we were beat up by Phantom...
Natsu fought for us back then.
Natsu gave me courage!
It's the same for everyone else, right?
This time, we'll be the ones to save Natsu!
All right! If we all work together, we can save Natsu!
Aye, sir!
Everyone...
Wait!
Master!
Fairy Tail is a guild that lives and dies with Magnolia.
Our first priority is to protect the city from being destroyed!
You want us to attack that thing?
But Natsu is inside of it!
Use any means necessary to stop the Dragonoid!
What? He'll be fine!
His body's built nice and sturdy!
Natsu!
Can you hear me, Natsu?
You are not a wizard that would be done in by something like this!
Erza...
We...
We are always like this.
We communicated by fighting.
If you hadn't been there,
I would have already thrown away my life.
I cannot lose you!
No matter what!
Natsu, I am going to bring you back with me!
Daphne!
Oh, too bad.
Time's up.
I'll stomp you flat, Erza Scarlet!
Blast Bullet!
Stinger Shoot!
Magic Card Explosion!
Water Slicer!
Sand Spear!
Looks like it's started...
Tell me why.
I'll take full responsibility.
I said, tell me why!
Gray!
Gramps... Only Natsu can defeat that Dragonoid!
So the master decided that destroying the Dragonoid was the top priority?
What about Natsu?
He said he was sturdily built, so he should be fine.
Oh, I see.
Natsu!
On Master's orders, we will stop the Dragonoid with our full strength!
Before we do that, I want to check with you!
Let us hear you!
Sure, I'll let you hear...
Natsu...
Ready?
Cock an ear and listen up.
Bust this thing up, and me along with it!
No matter how far away, we'll come when you call!
Whether it's searching for monsters or defeating monsters...
Secret requests? Leave them to us!
No matter what the problem, we'll solve it with one punch!
What's that, you say?
That's Fairy Tail in a nutshell!
Next Time: Fairy Tail Wizards.
Perfect!
Yeah, I think we should cut out your lines, Natsu. They get in the way.
Huh? Did I say something wrong?
