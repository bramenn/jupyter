Nana had a red tattoo on her arm.
It was the lotus flower, the flower also known as Ren...
What that flower meant to her,
of course, I had no way of knowing at the time.
When I was darkness at that time
With trembling lips
The more I struggle
The more this wound deepens
The broken promise hurt me
Nobody can save me
God, I have only one request
Stop tearing apart my love
I need your love
I'm a broken rose
Sorrow tumbling down is your song
All alone with nowhere to go in my life
I need your love
I'm a broken rose
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain
With your smile, your eyes, and sing me, just for me
I wanna need your love
I'm a broken rose
I wanna need your love
Ohh, that's bright. I've gotta get curtains.
I've gotta get to work!
What time is it?
What am I gonna do?!
Good morning, Hachiko.
It's a nice day. Wanna go for a walk?
Why didn't you wake me up?!
- You idiot, idiot, idiot! - Why should I hafta wake you up?
Because, I have to work!
The shop opens at 11 and I'm late my first day!
Late? It's still early.
You don't have to be at work until about ten, right?
You got lots of time.
You're kidding. But my alarm clock said eleven.
The clock you got yesterday at Mizukoshi's?
You mean it's broken already?
Nana, I don't think this clock is moving.
It's still at the time it was when I set it last night.
I'm gonna get that Mizukoshi, just as soon as I get to work.
The refrigerator better be working.
Oh good. It's nice and cold.
Were you cooling something?
Beer. Want some?
Yay!
No, not yay! You got work, remember?
But I'm thirsty! No, I'm hungry!
I should have bought something!
By the way, I ate the hamburger.
It was awesome good! Thanks.
You ate it all by yourself. Not fair!
Well then, write do not eat on the darn thing next time!
A present for Nana From Hachi Well then, write do not eat on the darn thing next time!
I wonder if there's a classy cafe or something like that open right now.
At this time of the morning? What do you expect?
I'll get you some dog food at the convenience store.
Found a cute bakery!
They all look really good! I don't know which one to get!
You really do have a good nose, don't you?
Being a dog.
Let's eat by the riverside. It looks so refreshing. A mini-picnic.
We need to get a table.
Hey, Nana.
The gas man's coming to open the valve today, isn't he?
Oh yeah. He said he could come in the morning.
I'll be at home, so don't you worry about it.
You go to work.
Your stuff from home is arriving today too, isn't it?
I'll be there to accept it.
Sorry. I've been leaving everything to you since yesterday.
No worries.
I got nothing better to do anyway.
But still...
What are you going to do about work?
Don't you have to find a job?
If you're not particular, jobs are easy to come by.
I wonder if that's true. Like, is life that easy?
Bought on impulse
Bought on impulse I know it's not for me to say, but...
Bought on impulse 50's headband I know it's not for me to say, but...
Bought on impulse 50's headband 70's dress and shoes I know it's not for me to say, but...
I know it's not for me to say, but...
Bought on impulse 50's headband 70's dress and shoes Hasn't been paid yet.
Hello, how are you today?
Jun-chan!
This place really suits you.
Shoji came over last night, you know.
Said you were going to be working here,
so I thought I'd come by and check it out.
It's good to see you got a good job.
Oh, so Shoji went over to your place after that!
Yup. He spent the rest of the night
drinking with Kyosuke until morning.
Oh good. I really didn't know what I would do
if he had gone to Sachiko's.
Who's Sachiko?
She's like an apprentice of the Demon Lord.
If it makes it easier to understand, she's kinda like the Muddy Mistress?
I have no idea what you're saying.
Nana, is this your friend?
Nice to see you, I'm Mizukoshi. I run the joint.
Oh, Mr. Mizukoshi, this is my best friend Jun-chan.
She's an art student.
Thank you for looking after Nana.
Jun-chan? Not Kyu, Japanese for nine?
Stop that, Mr. Mizukoshi.
By the way, Hachi...
- Hachi? - About this clock.
Did you fix it?
Well actually, it's natural it won't move without batteries in it.
Oh of course. How embarrassing. I'm so sorry.
No, it's my fault.
I guess I forgot to put batteries in the box.
I'll set it for you later.
Sorry to trouble you. Thank you.
Oh, why don't you go for lunch with your friend
while business is still slow?
Really? You don't mind?
No problem. I'll watch the shop.
Yay! See you in a bit.
Your disease, it's started again.
You know the Jackson burgers are really good!
I should've known there was something going on,
you finding a job so quickly.
Didn't expect such a young boss.
Koichi Sato! Another burger please.
You got it.
Hey, you know I don't care.
As long as you have a job.
Never mind the reasons for sticking to it.
Just don't give Shoji a hard time.
Like last night, too, he got drunk and started saying stuff.
Saying stuff?!
Last night, too? Is he always saying stuff about me?
Uh...
So actually, Shoji really doesn't like me!
Because I'm good for nothing!
It's not like that.
Shoji is so in love with you
he doesn't know what to do with himself.
You're not going to find a man like that just anywhere, you know that?
You gotta take better care of him, man.
Otherwise, that's when heaven'll get you back.
I know that.
But what do I need to do, and how, in order to take better care of him?
Actually, I thought I was taking pretty good care of him.
I wonder if I should have spent the night with him last night.
Nana, it's eight o'clock, so I'm going to close up shop now.
Oh, okay!
Thanks for hanging in there.
Must have tired you out being such a slow business and all.
Not at all.
Just to think that I can work
amongst all this cute stuff every day from now,
I'm totally happy.
As long as you don't mind.
Are you hungry?
Do you want to go for something to eat after we close up?
I'll buy.
Really?
- Heaven'll get you back! - What do you want to have?
Is there anything you don't like?
I'm sorry, Mr. Mizukoshi.
I have other plans for tonight. It totally slipped my mind.
- A date? - No! It's not like that!
You don't have to be embarrassed.
You're that age, you're allowed to have a boyfriend or two.
Tell him to visit the shop. I'll give him a discount.
Thank you.
I messed up.
No, no, it's fine. I've got Shoji.
I'd be in trouble if things started to look good with Mr. Mizukoshi.
Like, these thoughts alone are totally inconsiderate of Shoji.
No way. It's not like that. I can't go on living without Shoji!
Why don't I call him?
Oh, Shoji...
Your phone is being re-directed to the answering service center.
Please leave a message after,.,
Maybe he's still working.
Call me when you get off work.
Call me when you get off work. Just because I'm in Tokyo now doesn't necessarily mean
Call me when you get off work.
Call me when you get off work. that I can see Shoji any time I want.
that I can see Shoji any time I want.
Send that I can see Shoji any time I want.
that I can see Shoji any time I want.
That's natural, but it feels kind of lonely.
I should have stayed over at Shoji's last night, after all.
Shoji's got his job,
and he's going to start going to school now too.
He'll be busier than ever. And I've got work now.
And working is kinda tiring.
Are we not going to be able to see each other when we want?
I guess life isn't so easy, after all.
I thought that if I at least made it to Tokyo, I could have everything my way.
In fact, I am getting my way, aren't I?
It's almost scary. I'm on a roll, even.
But I hardly get the feeling I've grasped anything in these hands.
I wonder why?
Besides, what is it that I really want?
Time with Shoji...
cute clothes and knick-knacks... classy apartment and furniture...
Sure they're all important, but something's missing.
Am I asking for too much?
Oh, hi Hachiko.
How was work?
What are you doing, Nana?
Carpentry.
I'm making a table and some chairs.
Wow! That's awesome! So elaborate and so cute!
We need a table to eat on, don't we?
I'll be finished in a minute, so when I'm done, let's eat.
But I didn't buy any groceries.
I'll go get something at the convenience store!
I've made some stew, if that'll do.
Huh?
And salad.
This looks so good! This is super!
Oh and your things arrived, so I stuck them in your room.
I handed your guarantor papers over to Mr. Ando, too.
I also received your key. It's over there.
Thank you, Nana!
What's that? I didn't really do anything.
Stop crying!
Nothing's gone wrong since I got to Tokyo.
In fact, it's Nana. It's always fun when I'm with Nana.
I always feel so positive.
It's strange, because we're so different in every way.
I guess this is what they mean when people say you just click.
Incredible! It's perfect!
The size is just right for the window!
Something store-bought just wouldn't work like this.
Right? Do you like it?
Oh, I do! You are so talented!
Hey, this is no big deal.
Besides, I got some scraps from a nearby construction site,
so it's basically free.
While I was at it,
I got one of the young workers to help me shave the wood.
Nana, you could be a carpenter! Cool, a girl carpenter!
Why don't you look for work in that line?
Might work,
but say I do this every day and then cut a finger or something.
I won't be able to the play guitar.
Oh, right, your guitar...
Shall we eat?
Hey Nana, are you looking to be a professional guitarist?
What, are you kidding?
I'm not good enough to make it as a pro.
But you used to play in a band, didn't you?
Well yeah, but I wasn't the guitarist, I was a vocalist.
You were the singer!
Awesome! Cool! Respect!
About what?
Well...
Tell me that after you hear me sing, man.
Yeah, I think I'd like to hear her sing.
There's no doubt in my mind that she'd be cool.
I'll be her greatest fan, for sure.
Hey Nana?
I've been wondering, that tattoo on your arm.
Is it real?
It's not a sticker?
Ah, yeah.
I knew it!
Wow! I've heard tattooing is incredibly painful.
You're so brave! I was scared just getting my ears pierced.
A bit of pain makes it all worth doing.
You think so?
Kinda like, being aware that you're alive?
Are you a masochist?
No, actually if I had the choice, I'm more the sadist.
So true.
But Nana...
That's the flower of the lotus, isn't it? Why did you choose the lotus?
Actually, it's the ren.
Huh?
Sui-ren?
Just plain ren.
You mean lotus.
I said no.
But that's totally a lotus.
Oh shut up!
But it definitely is a lotus. Why are you being so stubborn?
Who's the stubborn one?!
Who could it be at this time of night?
Miss Osaki. I have a delivery for you.
It could be the stuff from Yasu!
That man sure works fast.
What a guy.
Good evening.
Nobu! What the heck are you doing here?!
Oh wonderful! The exact response I was expecting!
Good!
Wow! This is delicious! I am so impressed!
- You'll make a good wife, Nana. - No... Umm...
You have the same name, but what a difference!
Thanks for the compliment. I made that.
Figures. I thought it was a bit...
If you don't like it, leave it!
What the heck are you doing here anyway? You!
Wha? I came to bring you your stuff!
It was an eight-hour drive, man! You could be thankful!
Well done, then. Now you may go.
- Get outta here. Go home! - Nana!
Please! Let me stay here just one night!
No way.
- In fact, I... - I don't wanna hear!
I ran away from home.
I told you, I don't wanna hear it!
Nana!
I have no attraction to my hometown, whatsoever.
Why do you treat him like that? He's your friend, isn't he?
Um, Nobu, is it?
Are you all right?
You don't have to be polite to me. I'm totally used to this.
Don't expect any hospitality, but you can stay here if you like.
Thanks. You're so kind...
I won't have it.
Nana, what are you going on about?
It's for him. He needs to smarten up!
Now you listen to me, Nobu.
You are to follow your father's footsteps and run that huge Japanese Inn.
Get it through your head.
I didn't choose to be born into that family.
Quit being a brat about it!
You are blessed, young man! Your future is guaranteed!
What's the need to throw away that happiness?!
I won't regret it in the least bit.
As long as I can play my guitar, I'm happy.
And I wanna play for you.
Don't make me repeat myself.
Hey Nana. Let's just at least let him stay tonight.
It's getting late already. Okay?
Oh, a phone?
Oh, it's mine.
Hello. Hey, Yasu.
Yeah, just got here a few minutes ago.
Hello Yasu? Do something about this stupid son, will ya?!
Why'd you get him to bring my stuff anyway?!
Oh sorry, but he insisted that he'd go.
What do you mean, but?! What are you gonna do about it?!
No smoking What do you mean, but?! What are you gonna do about it?!
No smoking
No smoking There's nothing I can do about it, Nana.
No smoking
No smoking Nobu's serious.
No smoking
Why don't you find some new band members and start over?
I know you'd prefer a band to going solo.
Besides, you can write lyrics but you can't write a tune.
Oh by the way, did ya listen to the tape?
Tape?
The new number Nobu wrote.
It's good.
If you sing it, in my opinion, nobody's got a chance over you guys.
This song is the best! It is so cool!
Did you really write this Nobu? I am so impressed! Really!
Nana.
Play it for me. I'd like to try and sing it.
Sure.
Oh, but I left my amp in the car!
This thing. No wonder it was so heavy.
What's this? Man, only one guest in the house tonight?
Pretty shabby if you ask me.
Oh, well, I guess that's how it is when just starting off.
One's better than none.
Good evening. We're Blast.
Good evening...
I'll make this a night you'll never forget.
I still can't forget that night.
There weren't any words to the song yet,
so you just sang a whole bunch of nonsense.
It was almost as if someone was putting a spell on me.
I became a prisoner of that voice of yours.
Our table became the stage,
your phone was the mike and the crescent moon was your spotlight.
Only you could make magic like that, Nana.
I still believe it.
The more I close my heart
The more this love tangles up
Nice and gently kiss me
Nobody can save me
Like a frozen rose
I want a peaceful sleep for my tears
I need your love
I'm a broken rose
Sorry dying, falling, is my soul
Collapsing in loneliness like a little girl.
I need your love
I'm a broken rose
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain
with your smile, your eyes, and sing me, just for me
I wanna need your love,.,
I'm a broken rose
I wanna need your love,.,
