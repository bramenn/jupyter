The prince should be with the princess.
Who was the one who decided that?
Kiss Him, Not Me
Can She Do It? A Real Life Otome Game
Nice one, Igarashi!
Thanks.
Nana, nice toss.
Well, of course it was.
Wow, talk about conceited.
Score.
Score.
Score!
So cute!
The prince with another prince.
Can't it be like that?
It should be like that!
Priceless. Absolutely priceless!
Lord, thank you for giving me this daily bread!
Oh, no! Nanashima-kun!
Crap, she really got pummeled!
Hey, are you okay? Serinuma!
Yeah.
It's okay. It's okay, Nanashima-kun.
Thanks for showing me something nice!
Don't die!
Don't die, Serinuma!
Infirmary
Oh, you're awake.
Are you all right? Can you see, Kae-chan?
A-chan? Where am I?
You don't remember?
Nanashima fell on top of you in P.E.
Oh, yeah.
He really hit you hard, huh?
I mean, my eyes were glued to them.
5x7 was unfolding right in front of me.
Come on, if you're talking those two, it's gotta be 7x5.
5 -> First character in Igarashi's name
7 -> First character in Nanashima's name
I get where you're coming from, though.
What?! It's gotta be 5x7.
Didn't you see who was hugging who?
It's 7x5. End of discussion.
I mean, they're tough servant and gentle prince-type characters, right?
A-chan, you just don't get it!
Right back at ya, Kae-chan.
My name is Serinuma Kae.
I'm a second-year in high school.
I'm a little... actually, it's pretty obvious!
I'm what you'd call a fujoshi.
I'm heating up.
I love seeing hot guys get along more than anything!
It's my favorite!
As my chest heats up from watching the passionate bonds between two guys, I pair them!
They don't even need a real connection.
My imagination is more than enough to pair them!
Any chance I get, I pair them!
This is my way of life!
And so, my classmates are no exception.
Nanashima really looks like Shion from Mirage Saga, doesn't he?
Oh, in that bad boy sorta way, right?
Yeah!
Excuse me, Serinuma-senpai.
If you're feeling better, would you kindly free up the bed?
Another student's here who isn't feeling well.
Oh, sorry, Shinomiya-kun. I'll head out now.
Let's go, A-chan.
S-Sure.
Honestly, you seem totally fine.
What?!
Look, here
It's fine, it's fine.
What's up with him?
That's Shinomiya-kun from first year.
We're both on the health committee.
Oh, so that's how he knew you.
He's pretty harsh for such a pretty boy.
But, doesn't that make it better?
The snootier a pretty boy is, the yummier he is, am I right?
You're right. The colder he acts, the hotter he gets!
Huh? Serinuma-san.
What happened to your face?
Mutsumi-senpai. I kinda had an accident during P.E.
I see. Are you all right?
Oh, yeah, totally! Thanks for asking.
Glad to hear it.
You know, Kae-chan, you seem to have a weird connection with hot guys.
Huh? You think so?
Mutsumi-senpai is great.
Maybe I should join the history club, too.
But, I dunno if I have a connection, per se.
Serinuma-san!
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
That's good. You really went flying back there. I was worried.
Nana.
What do you want?
Apologize. It's your fault, you know.
Uh, sorry.
Don't worry about it. You weren't hurt, Nanashima-kun?
I came out unscathed, thanks to you, the human cushion!
Human cushion?!
N-Nana!
I'm glad I was useful!
Nana!
C'mon, man.
Ow!
In any case, we're sorry.
Twitch!
What was that? Was that supposed to be an apology?
Jeez, the only good thing about Nanashima is his looks.
Don't let it bother you, Kae-chan.
A-chan.
Did you see that? Igarashi apologized even though Nanashima was the one who did it.
Is that a pairing? It is, right? That's a pairing! It's too much!
Okay, maybe let it bother you a little, Kae-chan.
It's all good. The cuteness makes me happy.
Really.
Even if I have a connection with hot guys, it's wasted on me.
A prince should be with a prince.
My happiness comes from peeping on the sidelines, not bothering them.
That's where I belong.
Shion plays a big part in Mirage Saga today, right?
Yup! I'm so looking forward to Shion!
Sorry if I spoil it on social media.
I mean, I definitely will.
That's fine. See you tomorrow!
Bye bye!
That's what I thought.
Until that day.
We reached out to the sky.
And gave one devoted prayer.
Slash through the darkness.
Ekka@ *** Shion's here! (q) =
This guy's tough!
This will be interesting!
Shion!
Today's animation is so pretty!
Phone: Ekka@*** Gyaaahh! (q) So cuuute! (q) Ekka@*** I feel like today's story's gonna be big!
Shion. This can't be!
Stand up! I'm begging you! Who is going to make Enchanito?
Shion!
Wh-What? What happened, Kae?
Shut up, fatty!
Serinuma Kae.
Is Serinuma absent again today?
She's been absent for a week already.
I can't reach her, and her tweets have stopped, too.
I hope she's okay.
Kae? Kae!
Stop shutting yourself in like this and come out.
You're not even eating. Goodness.
Takuro, do something, will you?
Huh?
Don't huh me! Aren't you worried about your little sister?
That fatty's such a pain.
Hey, fatso!
Get your ass out of bed!
Take a bath and eat!
You'll die if you keep at this, fatty!
No!
Don't give me that crap! Stop being a headache for mom!
C'mon!
Fine.
My hair's all oily.
I'm gonna take a bath.
I guess I'll tell A-chan what happened.
Shion...
What?
What kind of poster is this?
Huh?
Mom! The mirror's broken!
K-Kae?! So it really is you, Kae!
Seriously?!
It can't be.
This can't be real.
But...
This is reality, so there's nothing I can do.
Good morning.
Oh, no, everyone's staring at me.
Does my uniform look strange?
I did force it to fit.
I should've stayed home!
A-chan!
It's been so long!
Sorry I haven't been in touch! I broke my phone!
That voice... Kae-chan, is that you?!
You're kidding! You're Serinuma? Really?!
Right?! How did this happen?!
What happened?!
What happened to you?!
N-No...
Stop it! You're scaring her. Everyone, relax.
Are you okay?
Thanks, Igarashi-kun.
Uh, sorry.
Whoa, are you for real?
She got cute after losing some weight. Unreal.
Right, Nanashima?
Are you okay?
Hey, Nanashima?
Yeah!
That's crazy. Seriously?
She's a real hottie, now!
Hey, Nana...
But don't forget what she used to be. You know...
Kae-chan!
Whoa, you made her cry!
Jeez, what're you gonna do now?
You're the worst!
Me?!
When I see Nanashima-kun, I start to remember Shion!
What are you doing?
Don't run! It's danger
Shinomiya-kun.
I'm sorry.
W-Wait!
Wh-What?
Uh... Well...
The infirmary.
Right, you fell, so you should go to the infirmary.
Shinomiya-kun is being nice?
An aloof guy like him?
Infirmary
Excuse me.
Mutsumi-senpai?
What happened? You're hurt!
It's nothing. I saved a cat that was stuck in a tree.
I got pretty badly scratched.
What were you thinking?
And you, Serinuma-san? What happened?
Oh, I just
What is it, Shinomiya-kun?
H-Her name...
Huh? Serinuma-san?
Serinuma Kae-san.
It can't be!
I guess I changed so much that he didn't recognize me.
I suppose you've gotten a little thinner,
but it's easy to tell who you are.
You're the only one who knew it was me right away.
Your kindness hasn't changed.
You're still Serinuma-san.
Thank you.
That's right. I'm still me.
Nothing's changed.
Serinuma-san, would you like to see a movie with me next Sunday?
Huh?
Igarashi!
Hold on, man!
I'm the one that's
Nana?
Ah, there you are!
Serinuma-senpai, may I talk to you for a minute?
Oh, Serinuma-san. I wanted to talk to you.
Huh?
Right. Nothing should have changed...
Kiss Him, Not Me
Kiss Him, Not Me
Nakano
Wh-What do you think?
Cute, but hot pants on a date is a no.
Okay, next try this on!
What? Again?!
No whining!
You're the one who asked me to lend you some clothes!
Ugh. Okay.
Still, a date, huh? Kae-chan on a date!
Huh? You really think this is a date?
What? I'm talking to Serinuma-san here.
Quick to make the first move, as always.
I wanted to apologize for my rude behavior earlier.
I was wondering if I could borrow the next part of the book you lent me.
Hold on!
I can't hear with you all talking at once!
I was asking if you wanted to go to a movie with me on Sunday.
I-I was gonna ask the same thing!
Me, too!
Th-Then... me, too.
So, I've somehow ended up going with all of them.
What is this, an otome game?
More like...
How did all of this happen all of a sudden, anyway?!
C'mon, who can leave a cute chick like you alone?
Oh, how does that fit?
Hmm, it's kind of tight around my breasts.
Is that right?
Well, what's the problem? Nab yourself a boyfriend!
But, I dunno how to do any of that sorta stuff.
Kae-chan!
A scar created by a man can only be healed by another man.
Shion!
Get fired up for a new genre: the boyfriend! You can do it!
Real life's an impossible game! I can only do 2-D!
A-chan, does your boyfriend know you're an otaku?
No way! He doesn't have a clue.
If he knew, it'd be over.
That's right, you'd best keep that under wraps.
You're right. I can't let them find out.
It's just for one day. Totally doable!
Yeah!
So hot...
Beautiful. They're perfect.
I want to watch them like this forever.
Serinuma-san! Over here!
S-Sorry for being late.
Oh, don't worry about it.
So cute.
Shall we?
The movie should be fun.
The Twilight of Love
It's over here.
Seat Order Determined by Rock-paper-scissors
All right! No fantasies today! Not a single one!
Are you okay?
It's already evening!
God, this is boring.
Getting sleepy...
Stare...
It was pretty good, wasn't it?
Y-Yeah, sure was...
Shoot. I was so busy watching those two, I don't remember a thing.
The story was absolutely horrible.
Here, use this.
I'm fine.
Isn't your runny nose giving you a hard time, though?
M-My nose isn't running!
Uh, but it is.
What is this dark horse?!
A senpai who cleverly handles his stubborn kohai. Not bad at
No fantasies!
I-I'm going to use the bathroom real quick!
Away with you, dark thoughts! Away with you, dark thoughts!
Away with you, dark thoughts! Away
Serinuma-san.
Igarashi-kun?!
Where's everyone else?
Don't worry about them.
Just come here for a sec.
Why? Igarashi-kun?
Sorry. If we can't be alone, let me have you to myself for just a little bit.
Okay?
What do I do? For some reason...
My heart's beating really fast.
Smile.
Wait!
Nana, how'd you know?
I know exactly what's on your mind!
Is that right?
Score! A 5x7 shot!
A national treasure! Humanity's pride!
Wasn't I just all flustered over a guy like some normal girl?!
What the heck is wrong with me?!
Not good.
I don't think I can do this!
I'd like an SLT burger meal. With small fries and cola.
Captain Teke Teke Full Heart Set. I want it.
Captain Teke Teke
Eek! It's the captain!
Serinuma-senpai?
I'll have black tea and apple pie!
I've gotta ride this out!
Teach me the words that say more than I love you because I want your heart!
I want to sing Shion's character song.
What are you going to sing?
Maybe Kao-chan?
I wanna sing so badly I'm shaking.
Okay.
Nothing good will come of them finding out I'm an otaku!
I'm not gonna let my faults show!
Serinuma-san, is everything all right?
You look a little unwell.
Not at all. I'm super.
I am having a lot of fun.
Are you tired? Should we go to a cafe and rest?
No, no. Really, I'm fine.
But, maybe it's about time I headed home.
Limited edition Mirage Saga merchandise! This store only, just for today!
Wha...
It's the last shipment from the manufacturing warehouse!
What?!
If it's a product limited to Anime Ito only, then...
It can't be...
Could it be that ever-so-rare product that sold out in under 10 minutes?!
It can't be!
I want to go make sure!
And if I'm lucky, buy it!
Hey, Serinuma?
Seriously, what's the matter?
Nothing!
No!
Just bear with it, me!
I've kept it together until now.
Just a little more and this will all be over!
Only one limited item left!
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
I have to go!
Serinuma-san!
She's out.
I'm sorry.
The truth is...
I'm an otaku.
Oh. Okay.
I'm sorry I disappeared so suddenly like that.
But I know if I let this chance slip away...
I'd regret it for the rest of my life! I just couldn't.
Iga
Nana
Shi
Mu
It means that much?
You all asked me out today, and I did my best to enjoy the date like a normal person,
but I guess I couldn't.
I blew it. It was all for nothing.
I was trying so hard not to show my flaws that I didn't enjoy myself.
Really, I'm so sorry.
But, I just can't lie to myself.
Thank you for today.
Sorry, but I'm not following you.
What's the problem?
Isn't it a good thing to have something you like?
That's how I feel.
And besides, Serinuma-san,
your eyes are sparkling right now.
I much prefer you like this.
S-Senpai!
That's right! This is way better than the dead eyes you had before.
Yeah. Your spark was completely out.
I've seen anime before, too. Like Eva, or something?
Don't worry about it.
Next, let's go somewhere you want.
We'll go with you.
Yeah.
You guys!
Thank you!
Okay, I wanna check out the new product line. Let's head back to Anime Ito! Heart.
Iga
Nana
Shi
And that's what happened! It was so fun.
Everyone's so nice!
Oh, and look at what I got.
It's 5x7!
Why'd you even go on a date, Kae-chan?
Also, it's 7x5.
Hey, Igarashi.
Have you ever fallen for anyone?
Sure, same as everyone.
Yeah? So what's your type?
What's with the interrogation?
C'mon, just tell me.
I guess a girl with a good head on her shoulders. Mature.
No way! Don't you want a girl that's your age or younger?
Nah, I don't really like loud, childish girls. I can't deal with boisterous girls.
Isn't it hard to talk to someone who's so tame, though?
I go for girls that are upbeat and bright!
Next Time: The Strange Room And The Four High School Boys
Look Forward To It!
On a date, we'd go to an amusement park or pool!
