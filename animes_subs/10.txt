It was the first time I'd ever hugged a girl.
I could feel a slight heat beyond the soft sensation.
She was so fragile, I felt like she'd break if I held her any tighter.
So lost and sad...
Rikka...
Rikka?
Forget it! Forget it! Forget it! Forget it! Forget it! Forget it!
Students are to leave the school by 8pm at the latest.
Master!
Do you dare design to draw forth the deathly night of devils from this darkness?
Master?
You're still as death! Did you freeze yourself in time?!
It doesn't seem that you have.
Master?
What the death are you doing? Master!
Could it be that Master finally accepts me as...
Master, we mustn't!
I'm your servant! We mustn't give in to our emotions like this!
Though of course, it's only natural that strong joy should turn to passion...
Master?
I hugged Yuuta.
I love Yuuta.
Master?
No way... Are you just a fake copy of Master?!
So now we not only have a fake Forest Summer, but Master as well?!
I'm the real one.
But... does that mean...
Master, you f-f-fell in love with the Dark Flame Master?
Master, I am needed for an urgent matter of life and death! I must take my leave.
Dekomori...
Don't try to stop me!
As your servant, it's my duty to cast the one who stole your heart into the darkn
What should I do?
You said that you were able to protect the Wicked Eye for this long thanks to the Dark Flame Master.
I'm sure he'll be able to realize your heartfelt feelings as well.
I wonder.
I've been serving under you for a little over two years.
It's the duty of the servant to know everything about their master.
Dekomori...
There's no need for you to worry.
The Wicked Eye's power exceeds death itself!
You'll be saying 'Til death do we part in no time.
Then, you and Takanashi...
Yeah.
What should I do?
About what?
Am I supposed to confess?
You love her, don't you?
I think so...
But it's not because she's cute or hot!
She's way beyond help with her eighth-grader syndrome,
but there's more to her than just that!
She has her problems, and I feel sorry for her, but...
I mean... I'm not just doing it out of pity, of course...
Say no more, dude.
You don't need a reason to fall in love.
What an expert you must be.
Good luck!
Same to you.
That's damn creepy!
How dare you treat me this way after I listened to your troubles?!
No one asked you to!
You mess up everything by spreading half-true rumors in class!
But darn, you're lucky.
Takanashi's got the potential to place 4th on the cutie poll.
With a girl like that...
With a girl like that?
One day, you'll...
We'll what?
Yuuta, I regret to say that I have no prior experience regarding bodily interactions.
Regrettably, neither do I!
Don't even suggest that! Are you nuts?!
Well then... I've got something of my own to sort out, so I'll catch you later.
Kumin!
What?
Would you come with me to the school fair afterparty?
Sure!
Really?
Cut!
Why do I always have to endure your two-bit acting?
We're not acting! And why are you even here at all?!
We need to get ready for tomorrow's performance.
Where are Togashi and Takanashi?
Do not utter those names in my presence.
My mood is deathly foul.
We shall fight.
You think we have time for that?
Put that energy into looking for those two so that
They already left, for death's sake!
The Dark Flame Master said they had something to discuss of deathly importance
Um...
Follow my orders as bound by your pledge...
Follow my orders as bound by your pledge...
Follow my orders as bound by your pledge...
What's that?
An enchanted gem. It fulfills wishes.
I got it from Dekomori.
Wishes?
I can't go into details!
That's okay, I don't need to know.
You dropped it.
It's warm.
Strong wishes cause the gem to emit heat.
Which means
Don't!
Ouch...
It started raining...
Do you have an umbre Of course you do.
What did you want?
Oh, right.
I have something too.
Something highly confidential I must discuss with you.
I-I see.
I wanted to talk about... But not here.
This can't go on.
Hey...
Hey...
Schwarz Sechs Prototype Mk II!
How can you say its full name so fast?!
Hey!
Good thing it didn't fall into the river.
What's up?
The lights...
The lights... are moving.
Rikka...
I love you, Yuuta.
I love you, Yuuta.
Wait, I was gonna say it first!
No. The Wicked Eye is destined to always be first.
I'm the Dark Flame Master!
The Wicked Eye's the strongest of all.
Geez, whatever.
It took me ages to come up with this, so I'm saying it anyway.
Thou who art surrounded by the flames of darkness,
I, the Dark Flame Master, beseech thee to forge a lover's
Okay, screw that. The point is
Continue!
Yuuta!
Thou who art surrounded by the flames of darkness,
I, the Dark Flame Master, beseech thee to forge a lover's contract between us.
Okay.
Shouldn't you be leaning on my chest?
Is it embarrassing?
Then, your hand?
My pinky.
Your pinky, then.
I'm home!
You're late!
Sorry, Kuzuha.
Demandant, do you possess feelings of love for the respondent?
No.
All I feel is that I want to be divorced from the respondent as soon as possible.
What are you doing?
We have to talk.
Huh?
This one's lost its taste too. You can have it.
Can't we discuss this at home?
I can't allow Rikka to hear it.
It's from the head restaurant in Italy. They invited me there for training.
I have no reason to refuse.
You really are that good, huh?
Did you doubt me?
Not at all!
Whatever.
But isn't that nice?
I'm sure Rikka will be
You get it, don't you?
I can't let her live there by herself.
So Mom's moving in in my stead.
Rikka's mother?
What do you think?
I don't
Do you think it's gonna work out?
Rikka doesn't hate her mother, right? Then
Mom...
Mom tried to talk with Rikka a number of times.
She apologized for not telling her about Dad.
But...
What's wrong, Tooka?
Please help me!
I'm sure she'd listen to you!
You just need to tell her to grow up!
She's grown up enough.
I think that eyepatch is the armor by which she protects herself.
I'm sure she understands... all of it.
But she can't deal with the gloom in any other way.
Acting like that is the only way she can protect...
Protect what?
I don't know.
But I'd say she still wants to hold on to it.
If she listened to you or your mother and swallowed the bitter pill, it'd be all over.
She doesn't want that.
What's wrong with it being over?
There's no Horizon or Wicked Eye!
No matter how much she looks for Dad, she'll never find him!
Well...
How is affirming what she says better in any way?
She's never gonna get what she's looking for!
But...
Encouraging her like that...
is irresponsible.
Here's your cheese potato! Thank you very much!
Wow, it's really popular.
That's just on the outside! Inside, it's a cruel, backstabbing gang!
That's why I don't want anything to do with them anymore.
So it's golden on the outside, gooey on the inside, just like a cheese potato?
Spare me your smart comments!
And where are Takanashi and Togashi?
They said they were going to change.
Hurry up!
Just you watch! Our impromptu performance will take all your customers away!
Oh look, it's Forest Summer!
Don't call m
Sato! Suzuki!
Hey! Haven't seen you since junior high!
How old are you this year? 716?
Are you still catching lizards?
Don't bring that up!
Didn't you paint your lips purple to feign sickness, Sato?
Oh, you were into stuff like that too?
You too, Suzuki!
I remember you claiming you'd found fairies!
I just...
Fairies?
You never know what'll be unearthed next. Mining for eighth-grade memories is a dangerous job.
Yesterday's business is still far from over!
Today I've increased my powers fourfold!
Ugh, it's heavy!
You're nuts.
How is affirming what she says better in any way?
Encouraging her like that...
is irresponsible.
Yuuta, you're so cool!
You don't have to look that impressed!
Your move!
Vanish into the embrace of dark flames!
Yuuta, do it!
I don't wanna.
But you'll have to do it soon anyway.
Yeah, I guess so.
Vanish into the embrace of dark flames.
There was no power in that.
Can there be any power in it?
Of course. Open your legs, bend your knees, and flap the tail of your coat.
Yeah, yeah.
Vanish into the embrace of dark flames!
No pictures!
Next, together.
It's almost time to begin our mission.
Let's proceed to our positions.
Yeah... I'm not really feeling it, though.
Rikka!
What?
Nothing.
Your pinky.
Excuse me...
Yes?
Would a girl named Takanashi Rikka happen to be here?
She's...
She's not here right now.
I see.
Could you give her this?
Um...
It's okay. I'm leaving right away.
I think she still doesn't want to meet me yet.
Am I really being irresponsible?
Yuuta!
Why are you spacing out there?
It's about time we started!
We've got so many visitors too!
Rikka...
Take off your eyepatch.
It's time for our long-running talent show!
Let's start then! Number one, on stage!
I'm number one, class 1-3, Haruno Shinya! I'll be doing impersonations!
First, the principal!
Are you done with the performance?
Yeah. The brat and I managed to pull it off.
She came at me with killing intent, you know!
Sorry.
I didn't expect...
you to say something like that.
That lunchbox, you know...
It was still warm.
It had a good heft to it, too.
It was stuffed.
With love?
With reality.
Number two! Class 1-4, Isshiki Makoto!
I'll shout!
Tsuyuri Kumin!
Please go out with me!
Sorry...
What about Takanashi?
I'll go look for her.
Togashi!
I think you did the right thing.
Thanks.
Class 1-4, Takanashi Rikka.
I'll sing.
Take a look
at the stars of the night
The tiny lights
of the tiny stars
Sing of feeble
happiness
What is she doing?!
Dad...
Dad liked this song.
Rikka...
That was Takanashi Rikka from class 1-4!
Thank you very much!
Does this song bring back memories for you, or something like that?
Let's look for a
sparkling daydream...
