With two Pokemon badges pinned to his jacket,
our hero, Ash, marches boldly along the path to, uh...
-the path to... -Where are we going?
How many times do I have to tell you? Vermillion City.
It's got a luxury cruise ship and I'm dying to see it.
We won't have time for sightseeing.
I've heard that there's a really great Gym in Vermillion.
A Gym? All right! I'm going to win my third badge.
-Let's go! -Don't get your hopes up.
There are a lot of tough trainers around here.
Ah, bring them on!
I bet none of them has even one Pokemon badge.
Pidgeotto, finish it!
Oh, Rattata!
And I win!
That's number ten!
You're a really great Pokemon trainer.
Well, I guess I was pretty good there.
Wow! You've got badges.
-Oh, you mean these? - You got two?
I think getting him those badges was a mistake.
Uh-huh.
-Pika, pika. -I bet you could even beat A.J.
-A.J.? -Yeah, he lives over there.
He's never lost a single match.
Until now. He hasn't come against somebody like me.
He's getting a big head.
Yeah, but his brain's still the same size.
Pika, pika.
Look at that! This Gym isn't even licensed by the Pokemon League.
Undefeated? Big deal! I can beat him.
98 wins in a row.
You may have won ten battles,
but he's won almost ten times more matches than you have.
I go for quality, not quantity!
Are you my next victim?
You must be the wild Pokemon trainer.
Huh! That's my job.
But beating chumps like you is my hobby.
Ready to lose?
-Wow. -Now, this is not too shabby at all.
Free! Free!
-What's in the backpack? -The wild Pokemon that I just caught.
There's a whole bunch more in the tent and then some.
-Hey, can I see them after the match? -If you want.
So which Pokemon are you gonna choose for my 99th win?
99th? Hmm.
I'm afraid you're going to have to change your sign after this match.
You'll be formerly undefeated.
You may think that you're hot stuff, kid,
but you're not playing in the Pokemon little League anymore.
After I win 100 matches in a row, I'll start competing for badges.
That means he's only two wins away.
And he'll be extra psyched to win.
98 wins and you still don't have a badge? That's tough luck, A.J.
I have ten wins and I've won two Pokemon badges.
Did you buy those badges or steal them?
Either that or you competed in some loser Gyms.
Where were they, Failure City or Wimpsville?
What do you mean, loser Gyms?
Hey, Ash! Pulverize this guy.
Let's get started, then. Sandshrew, go!
A Sandshrew, huh? This should be interesting.
Let's be careful now, Ash.
Remember, Sandshrew is a Ground type,
so Pikachu's electricity is no good against it.
I know exactly what I'm doing. I don't need your help.
Pidgeotto, I choose you!
-Sandshrew, go. -Pidgeotto, dive at it!
Ash is lucky. The flying Pokemon should have the advantage here.
Too bad Sandshrew can't fly.
-Pidgeotto! -Finish it!
Uh-oh! Pidgeotto, return!
Butterfree, I choose you!
You can do it! Flying versus ground should be no problem.
That's what you think, kid. Now watch and weep.
Go! Stun Spore!
Free?
That Sandshrew is well-trained.
He controls it with a crack of his whip like a lion tamer.
-Shrew! -Free!
-Butterfree! -It's not so free anymore.
Chu!
Come on, Pikachu. You've got to help your friends.
Pikachu!
Nice work.
-That Sandshrew is very tempting. -We should grab it.
Hmm. Looks fat. You two got to carry it.
The outfit that trainer is wearing is positively hideous.
That shirt looks like it's from a century or two ago.
He'd fit right in perfectly at a museum.
At least he doesn't look like he's trick-or-treating like you do.
-Unh! -Meowth! Unh.
And that makes victory number 99.
It's not fair. I'm the one with the badges.
How about two out of three?
Stop whining, kid. Nobody wants to compete against a crybaby.
Hey, there's something fishy here.
I didn't have any problems winning until I battled in your ring.
How do I know this whole match wasn't rigged?
That's it. You cheated!
How else could Sandshrew defeat Butterfree?
Flying Pokemon always have the advantage over Ground Pokemon.
Chill out.
What do you say we go replay the match someplace else, huh?
Ash doesn't know when to quit, does he?
That A.J. sure is strong. I don't get it. How is he so good?
One more chance.
Come back when you grow up.
Hmm. It's not fair.
Looks like you'll have to rethink the way you train.
-What do you mean? - You call that last match a fight?
It's time for some serious training.
Rattata!
Get back in the water!
Knock it off!
Now what do you want, a swimming match?
-You're hurting Sandshrew. -Mind your own business.
I don't need any amateurs teaching me how to train Pokemon.
You call that training? What's that?
-It looks like a straitjacket. - That's no straitjacket.
It's a strength intensifier.
-Who invented that thing? -I did.
It's my own secret weapon for unleashing a Pokemon's powers.
Sandshrew, back in the pool!
But Sandshrews are weakened by water.
-I know that. -You'll hurt it!
Sandshrew, dive!
Nice dive.
-Good work. -The water doesn't weaken your Sandshrew?
You're looking at the only Sandshrew in the world
that's strong enough to withstand water.
Sandshrew, pick up your pacing!
Hey, wait. I thought you said pacing, not passing.
-Pikachu! -Huh, I said padding.
I mean, I said pacing!
Why are you so tough on Sandshrew?
I have to be tough, but I ask no more of Sandshrew
than I do of myself, the very best.
But you aren't nearly as tough on any of your other Pokemon.
That's because Sandshrew is the first Pokemon I ever caught.
I will never forget that moment.
We promised to do whatever it took to become
the greatest Pokemon and trainer of all time.
Nothing would stop us from reaching our dream,
no matter how difficult our path.
Enduring fierce storms and raging winds,
we're sacrificed everything to achieve our dream.
And it was worth it. We're an unbeatable team.
What you're doing is wrong.
A great trainer should make friends with his Pokemon.
Why should I listen to you?
Hey, Brock, don't you have anything to say about this?
I do. Your Pokemon are all in great shape.
What kind of Pokemon food do you give them?
-Ah. -My own recipe.
Come on, I'll show you.
To get the results I want, I have to carefully monitor the Pokemon diets.
-Of course, the recipe is secret. - Oh, yeah, of course.
You know, I mix my own food too.
Pikachu!
-Insulated gloves? -Check.
-Big rubber ball? -Check, check, check-a-rooni.
Team Rocket will do what it has to do...
To snatch that little Pikachu.
Maybe we should go back to our old motto.
This one doesn't feel right.
Hey, how about a theme-Meowth song?
And I can even do a little dance solo.
Everyone loves me-ooh-thic.
A song's no good.
A dance won't work.
-Here's a line you'll like. -And what's that?
How about, choreography killed the cat?
Okay, you wimps get a 15-minute break.
-Hey! -Now what do you want?
Your Pokemon are totally wiped out.
You better believe it.
In this Gym, we live by the rule no pain, no gain,
but judging by your little stuffed Pikachu over there, you don't follow any rules.
It's not a stuffed Pikachu. Take it back!
Hey, did you hear me? I said take it back!
- -Don't, Ash!
You don't win badges for being buddy, buddy with a Pokemon!
Knock it off, you two!
Isn't there a rule against splashing in the pool?
Pika, pika, chu...
I'm getting dizzy.
Stop complaining. Look for Pikachu.
- Roll over there. - What's that?
- Could it be Pikachu? - Yeah, that's it. Now hurry!
All that rolling made me nauseous.
Got it.
- Lets go. - Hurry! I feel sick!
- Watch where you're going! - This way!
Hey, take it easy. Ah, my leg fell asleep.
I wish your mouth would.
Why do you keep hanging around here?
There must be other trainers you can bother.
Yeah, right.
Time's up. Back to work, all of you!
Hey, where's Sandshrew? Well, that's weird.
What's your Pikachu doing?
Oh. Ohh!
Pikachu.
-It's no use. -Here, give it to me.
-Huh? -Pikachu!
Pikachu, you're okay.
Pikachu, have you seen Sandshrew?
-Pika. -You haven't.
Sandshrew! Where are you?
Maybe it ran away.
What are you talking about?
The way you treat your Pokemon, I'm surprised they all haven't run away.
Sandshrew and I have been together for a long time.
Yeah, I know, but when Sandshrew saw how well Pikachu and I get along,
it thought, I deserve better.
I'll find a trainer who treats me like Ash treats Pikachu?
Sandshrew would not break the promise we made,
not after all we've been through, not just before our 100th victory!
Chu.
Now move it. Go find Sandshrew.
-Free! -Rattata!
Those clowns will never catch up with us.
I'm exhausted. You take the bag now.
But a real gentleman always carries the bag.
Is that so? Well, as you know, I'm no gentleman.
You've all had enough of A.J.
and the way he pushes you around, haven't you?
Well, you don't have to put up with it anymore,
because now you can come with me.
Anyone who's coming with me, raise your hand!
Just raise your hand. Get them up there.
-Ash is making a fool of himself again. -Mm.
You see what happens when you try to start a mutiny in my Gym?
My Pokemon are all loyal.
So then where's Sandshrew?
-Meowth! -
Sandshrew.
How could they possibly pick him over me?
Wow, A.J. does care about them.
-Pika, pi, chu! -What is it?
Meowth!
So then it must've been Team Rocket that kidnapped Sandshrew.
-Wake up. -Meowth?
Hey, where am I? What's going on here?
How am I gonna get out of this mess?
- Prepare for trouble. - Make that double.
-Meowth? -Ugh, Team Rocket.
Use the old motto.
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love,
to extend our reach to the stars above...
-Jessie. -James.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light!
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Meowth! That's right!
That felt great. We don't need a theme song.
It's a classic.
So these are the creeps who kidnapped my Sandshrew?
Mm, that was an unfortunate mix-up.
We have no interest in your second-rate Sandshrew.
Second-rate?
The only Pokemon we want is Pikachu.
You can keep all those other wimps.
Wimps, are they?
That's it! Huh?
I'll take care of this.
No one insults my Pokemon and gets away with it.
Let's step outside.
Uh-oh.
Team Rocket has insulted our Gym!
We'll answer them with our 100th win.
100th.
That's right. As Sandshrew and I vowed.
Good luck!
Your small talk will cost you big-time!
-Ekans, go! -Your turn, Koffing!
Ekans!
Koffing!
Sandshrew, go!
-Koffing! -Ekans!
Ekans, bind it now!
Ekans!
-It's so strong. -Good work!
Excellent!
Koffing, Sludge attack!
Koffing!
Meowth, don't just stand there.
Stop pussyfooting around!
Just biting my time.
Ah! The moment of tooth!
Finish it! Sandshrew, Fissure Strike!
Go, Sandshrew! Drill into the ground till it splits!
That's it! I forfeit the match!
-Koffing! -Ekans!
-Come back here! -Meowth, where are you going?
To write us a theme song!
Not that again! Ugh!
We did it, Sandshrew! We finally reached victory number 100!
Today, all our sacrifices and hard work have finally paid off!
Now we can start winning our badges.
When I return here, I'm gonna be the number one Pokemon Master.
Why don't you come along with us?
Thanks, but Sandshrew and I have our own path that we must follow.
Someday we'll meet again at the big Pokemon League competition.
Okay, but next time, you better be in shape,
because I only want to beat expert trainers.
That's a deal.
So long!
He's tough, but pretty cool.
Yeah, looks like you've found another rival.
A.J., I'm not going to lose next time!
I'll train hard to become the greatest Pokemon Master in the world,
following my own path.
There are many paths that lead to the Pokemon League
and Ash is just beginning to discover his own.
What lies on that path is unknown,
but one thing's for sure,
he'll never forget the name of that place with the great Gym again.
-J Pokemon! J -Its that time again!
A hundred and fifty Pokemon, five days a week.
Thats about 30 or so each day.
Its not too hard, just listen real good!
