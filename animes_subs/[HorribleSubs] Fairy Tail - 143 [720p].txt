Yeesh. You're gonna make me drunk without even drinking anything.
So, did you find out anything?
Everything is starting to add up.
Thanks to you, Dora...
Mest.
The new Oracion Seis is responsible for the serial destruction of those churches.
In some of the churches that they attacked,
there were signs that someone had been taking shelter there.
About the victims,
there's no record of them in any of Zentopia's documents.
At first, I thought they were corpses...
It must be some kind of suspended animation.
It's like... No, never mind.
The Zentopia headquarters
and the underground organization that exists among some of the local parishes...
Something is happening there that involves whoever had been secretly harbored.
And we need to find out the identity of that person?
Did you hear something, Nico?
Anti-Link!
Oh, my! A handsome man!
The new Oracion Seis!
So you're the one called Angel?
An-gel-tan!
You're my angel!
I hate clingy men.
What is he? Another one of the Six Generals?
No!
I'm Legion's number one lancer, Dan Straight!
I was devoted to Lu-tan, but now I'm devoted to Ange-pon!
I should tell you, I'm devoted to Laxus.
What are you two competing for?!
Hey, wench! Where'd you put the Infinity Clock?!
A stupid question...
The cost is 40. Be embraced by the power...
That's Angel Magic...
How profound! How awe-inspiring!
Although that shadow by her eye is disquieting...
I summon Shamsiel, angel of sunlight!
Here I am! How are you?!
What the hell is that?!
It's plump and cute!
Play with them.
Roger! Let's play! Pick me up!
Sure, I'll play! I'll carry you!
What the hell did you come here for?!
Dark Ecriture! Pain!
Ice Make Saucer!
That tingled!
An angel's sun rays are bright!
Be destroyed by your own voice.
Evergreen! Max!
There's something I want to ask you.
Do you know Cubelios?
I see.
What are you convinced about, asshole?!
This guy can hear people's thoughts.
Isn't that a mild form of sexual harassment?!
I have no more use for you.
Evergreen!
What was that?!
That wasn't only Listening Magic!
He absorbed sound, amplified it, and fired it.
It makes the air vibrate. I see...
I can hear you.
Robe of Remoteness.
You're thinking it will mitigate my sound attack enough for you to strike a blow.
I can hear it.
That movement, that swordsmanship...
Impressive, Titania. Your movements have become keener.
You didn't defeat Grimoire's Azuma for nothing.
If I recall correctly, Natsu beat this guy by attacking without thinking and a loud voice.
That was seven years ago.
That won't work on me now.
Nonsense!
Seven years ago...
Because of you people,
Erza!
I lost Cubelios!
Give me back my friend... Give me back Cubelios!
Cubelios...
It's okay, Nico. The curate went out on our behalf yesterday.
Hey...
Yeah...
Who are you?
Are you... a Celestial Wizard?
Wendy!
Nico!
Wait!
Let go of me!
Calm down!
I'm Lahar, the Captain of the Enforcement and Detention Corps of the Magic Council.
I'm here on an investigation.
The Magic Council?
It's been seven years...
She would probably look like this now.
If that girl had lived...
Hang in there! Please hang in there, Bickslow-san!
Forget about me. Get out of here, Wendy!
It's pointless. He can't move.
You left yourself wide open, little girl.
Up against natural phenomena,
human strength and grit are very easily mowed down.
Why?
Even though you might have had a chance of winning by abandoning him...
Abandoning... Abandoning a friend is unthinkable!
Friend?
Idiot! Don't be so soft!
Sometimes the courage to leave a comrade is necessary!
No! I'll never abandon a friend!
Friend...
What's that?
Who are they?
What was that just now?!
Did you see that, Wendy? He...
Open! Gate of the Chisel! Caelum!
Please keep watch.
Two gates open simultaneously...
Um... Is there something you want to say?
You've been staring at me.
Is a Celestial Wizard so unusual?
No... That's not it.
Your name is Katja?
You remind me of someone I knew.
I do?
Who are you calling flat as an ironing board?!
I didn't say anything!
Why are you fooling around?
Uh, pardon me.
N-No, I'm the one who owes you an apology.
So, I remind you of a girl?
She died seven years ago.
If I had done things differently then...
Huh. I'm a little envious.
Even though she died years ago, you still care about her...
I don't have anyone like that...
No, even if I did, 100 years is...
I'd already given up.
One church after another was attacked,
and most of my friends had passed on.
What do you mean by given up?
Living now.
Now...?
So I thought I'd at least
remember even a little of this age's landscape...
It's okay. We'll...
We'll...
Tell me.
Are you the one who's been given shelter by this church?
Yes.
Who the devil are you... Both of you?!
Caelum!
What was that?!
Oh, no!
Katja! Behind you!
I found you.
Hold on!
Be careful, Mest! That guy's...
Destroy... the vessel...
Already, there is not a moment to waste.
News of the archbishop's madness has begun to leak to the outside world.
We must elect the next archbishop with all due haste and hold the inauguration...
Quiet!
Now more than ever, with Zentopia's secret techniques being lost,
you must realize
that the archbishop's personality
will be the only support for the confused, powerless lambs.
However...
Are you sure about this?
Maggots.
Replacing the archbishop at this late date would change nothing.
The end is in our grasp...
Destroy... the vessel. Destroy!
Bastard!
You're very quick.
Lahar! Take this girl and get away!
Understood!
But I...
Go, I said!
Mest-san...
Let's leave this to him. There's no need to worry.
Despite appearances, he's quite skilled. Moreover...
Um... Thank you!
I've thrown away a lot...
Destroy...
Monster... Let's have a showdown to see who's faster!
Shit... He's fast!
But this ain't over yet!
Direct Line!
He moves so fast that it's easy to be fooled...
And if that's true, if I surround him with my even simpler Direct Line,
I can see your movements.
Shit! The blank of the last seven years I've spent drinking is kicking my ass!
Am I too fast? My apologies.
No one can catch up to me.
Stop it! Stay out of my head! I don't need any memories!
Bastard. His memories are coming back.
Keep away, Kageyama! Don't say anything to me!
His memories are trying to come back, while some kind of force is resisting it.
Right now, it looks like you're gonna be crushed by your own memories!
It looks painful.
If I could restore his memories with my Healing Magic...
Just how soft-hearted are you?!
I'll try it!
It's your fault, little girl! Die!
Roar of the Sky Dragon! Plus Cure!
Get blown away, little girl!
Remember!
You're in over your head!
Hey!
Jeez, how pathetic can you get?!
Is this the kind of strength that I wished for?
You're...
Something came out of his soul.
Oh, no... I...
I hurt someone with my power of healing?
No. I saw what happened.
You healed him.
You healed his heart.
You'll explain?
Yes.
What the new Oracion Seis is after
is the destruction of regional churches, and the Anti-Link, which you've seen.
Anti-Link?
Ever since the formation of Zentopia,
there's been a secret underground organization operating from within.
We Neville Celestial Wizards have been sheltered by them.
Neville? The Celestial Wizard and author of Key of the Starry Heavens?
We're the descendants of Will Neville's disciples.
And at the same time, there's also a biological link to a certain something.
What?!
As long as we live, we have to protect it.
These markings testify to that.
But they're also an abominable curse.
What is it you're protecting? And the victims up to now...
They're neither alive nor dead. What the devil are they?!
They're...
Run, Wen... dy...
Bastard!
I'm going to activate the Anti-Link amplitude limiter.
This is the end of me...
What's happening?!
Huh? Nothing...
Katja!
No... It can't be... Hey!
Katja! Open your eyes!
The Anti-Link is complete.
I found you, Will Neville.
Not a bad job, being able to sleep for eternity in this moldy underground lair.
However, there aren't many of your disciples left.
The cruel, cursed vessels...
What? There's no need for concern.
I'll accept all of the nightmare that you saw.
Are you okay? Stay with me.
I'm more worried about you, after fighting him...
Never mind me! I don't know what the hell happened...
It seems that when the Anti-Link was activated, the biological link was severed.
But I'm not cursed...
At the same time, though, it seems all of your magic has disappeared.
Nico! Thank you for everything!
Tell that to everyone else, too!
Right... It won't be 100 years from now.
I'm sure we'll be able to meet again sometime.
You understand what he says.
Yes. I couldn't pick up most of it,
but he said thank you to you too, and Get your paws off of her!
P-Pardon me!
So you're no longer a Celestial Wizard.
I-I'm sorry...
It looks like I couldn't protect you in the end.
Oh, no. You did protect me. From a terrible curse...
I can live now
thanks to no one but you.
Thank you.
I-I...
You too, live for the present.
Letting yourself forever be caught up in the past
only results in missing opportunities to learn important things, Mest.
What are you talking about?
I'm not Mest. I'm Doranbolt!
Yes.
Break loose from the past and learn with your own eyes and ears that they're safe.
That's the beginning of your new path.
One thing bothers me...
It's like Samuel said. I have a strange feeling that something is out of place, too.
For some reason...
This doesn't make sense! I haven't even been able to land one punch!
And he wants us to attack him head on?!
This feeling that something is wrong... It's like Cana's divinations are backfiring...
From the front or back, I'm gonna beat the crap outta you!
Hey... Natsu, wait!
Zentopia was after the hand of the Infinity Clock
that Lucy's dad left her.
But in the end, both we and Legion
were totally trashed by the new Oracion Seis.
Natsu!
It ain't over yet! In fact, I can do this all day, asshole!
I'm gonna take you apart, I guarantee it!
Yeah! It has nothing to do with whether we have good battle chemistry or not!
Amen!
I feel like we're overlooking something that's incredibly important.
I hope Natsu is okay...
It seems we've hit a dead end...
Gildarts, what's that?
Someone's here.
Looks like she's alive...
Who is it? And what's she doing hidden down here?
Um... After a major accident several years ago, it seems she was receiving treatment here.
But even if she recovers, this lacrima is designed to keep her in a comatose state.
Meaning that if she woke up, it would be inconvenient for someone?
So, what's her name?
It says Michelle Lobster. It's no mistake. This is her.
What? This girl is Michelle?!
So it seems.
She lost her family in an accident at the Lobster Plantation. She's their only daughter...
Michelle Lobster.
Hey, wait a second.
Then who the hell is that with Lucy?!
What's that?! The sound of bells? Coming from the sky?
Natsu, Natsu! That must mean it's lunchtime!
I'm hungry!
Huh? Lunchtime already?
Alright! Then let's go out to eat somewhere, Lucy's treat!
Aye, sir! Hey, there's a giant fish flying through the air!
Then that'll be our lunch!
Next time: Unleashed Despair!
I wonder if we can eat that...
If you're fired up, you can eat most things, right?
I don't know... That obviously looks like it'd be tough to chew...
