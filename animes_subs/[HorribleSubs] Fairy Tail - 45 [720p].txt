Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Laxus started the Battle of Fairy Tail.
Erza defeated Eve of the Raijin Tribe,
and those of us who were stoned finally turned back to normal!
But just when we thought the game was over, Laxus activated the Thunder Palace,
and everyone in the entire city is being held hostage!
The real battle starts now!
Yo Ho! Steer that rudder! Hard to port!
Yo Ho! Our high-flyin' lives are every which way!
When the sun goes down, there's a bon voyage bash.
It ain't sad at all.
As long as we're alive, we'll meet again somewhere!
Blast straight through a headwind, set off!
Stay strong until the tears dry up! A man gotta be tough.
Friends, friends, laugh one day!
As proof of our strong, strong bonds!
Now, grab that map to the shining future!
Wow!
It's the Lion clad in Light!
I told you, it's no use! Your attacks won't affect souls!
Because no matter how many you destroy, I can just manipulate other bodies!
Get to it, my new babies!
No matter how many come at us, I won't let them get near Lucy!
Now's our chance!
Aye, sir!
Whoa there...
Don't freak me out like that, cosplay princess!
That's not it, jeez!
Lucy, force him back!
Bickslow himself isn't that strong!
What the hell are you saying, you bastard!
Damn it...
Guess I have no choice.
Huh?
Could he be...
Satan's Descent!
Figure Eyes!
Don't look into his eyes!
All the Raijin Tribe have secondary magic in their eyes!
Eve uses it as her main magic,
but if you look into Bickslow's eyes, you turn into a doll, and your soul will be manipulated!
Seriously?
Close call!
So, your eyes closed?
Yup!
Don't open your eyes, you two!
My Doll Possession and Figure Eyes are an unbeatable combination!
Lucy, close my gate temporarily and take shelter in Horologium!
You're the one who just showed up!
And I had my keys taken away from me!
Plus...
I trust you, so do something!
Right!
Let's go for it, Lucy!
When I give the signal, open your eyes and charge in!
But if I open my eyes...
You trust me, right?
Got it...
Regulus is fully risen.
Lion Flare!
My... My eyes!
Lucy!
Okay!
Loke... There's no way you can beat me!
I'm nothing like I was back then.
I met Lucy, and I regained my true powers as a Spirit.
No... I met Lucy and got even stronger!
I'm not like those dolls you manipulate!
Love makes Spirits stronger!
Regulus Impact!
Thank you, Loke.
Look, Lucy...
The light of love!
Uh...
He lllikes you...
Please don't roll your tongue like that.
Huh? I feel so weak...
That's because you opened two of the Zodiac gates...
I'll come to save you any time.
Yeah... Thanks.
Lucy won!
No way!
That cheerleader can fight?
Lucy's strong, man.
You're joking! I mean, she's a cheerleader!
I knew Lu-chan could do it!
Cheerleaders are strong!
I've gotta solve this, too!
I ain't never heard that before!
Why, you...
Haven't you ever heard of the Tortoise and the Cheerleader?
That's a hare, not a cheer!
And the hare lost!
Sure, the first time.
If I can just figure this part out...
But then the hare won like a hundred times in a row afterwards.
If I rewrite the runes...
But this is the hardest part to...
That makes sense. Learning from failure.
That's it!
What's it?
I got it! You read the two grammars at different rates to decipher it!
Then I match the corresponding time differentiated letters and convert to Gheel grammar...
Then translate into Rogue...
I solved it!
Wait a sec! I'll rewrite the runes!
Yeah!
Natsu... Gajeel...
Are you ready? You're about to join the Battle of Fairy Tail!
I'm all fired up!
It's time for rampage!
Elfman...
Nee-chan...
You're injured really bad...
Thank goodness... You're back to normal.
I'm sorry, Elfman.
I'm sorry...
Why are you apologizing?
Both during Phantom's attack and now...
I wasn't able to do anything...
And...
You don't have to.
All you need to do is greet everyone with a smile
after this pointless fighting is over with.
Please...
Don't cry.
Juvia...
How much longer until the Thunder Palace activates?
About 30 minutes, perhaps.
Laxus, damn him...
Battle of Fairy Tail, my ass!
He's just hiding himself and doing nothing!
Where can he be?
Laxus is saving his magical power.
He's saving his energy in case he has to fight the master for real.
Freed!
So that's the person who made the runes?
Running away?
Wait, Freed!
Shoot, runes!
A trap?
Rule: Exiting these runes is forbidden,
until one of you can no longer fight.
I'll fight whoever the victor is.
Now, begin.
That's a cheap trick, Freed!
If you wanna go at it, you don't have to do this! I'll take you on!
Now let me out!
Or could it be that you're scared of taking us both on by yourself?
Scared of two women? How pitiful, Freed!
I just don't want to dirty my own hands if I can help it.
Say that again, you bastard!
So this is how you got the allies to fight each other...
Allies?
Well, I'd prefer it if Cana remained.
Juvia Lockser...
You are and will always be Phantom's woman...
Who knows when she'll turn her sword against Fairy Tail again?
Damn you, Freed!
I suppose there is nothing else to be done.
Juvia, you're...
Freed-san, will you really fight the one that remains with honor?
I will never break my rules.
That's good to hear.
Are you serious, Juvia?
You'll just be playing into his...
It's no use! You can't get out of the runes no matter how high you go!
If it takes being injured to open the path...
If it's between my friend or myself...
The lacrima?
Don't attack that!
Then Juvia will lead the way!
Juvia!
Juvia!
This way the runes are... unlocked...
What the hell were you thinking?
Juvia wants people to hurry and accept her...
I love everyone...
What are you saying?
You're already one of us...
Being accepted? You're already our friend...
You're a wonderful Fairy Tail wizard!
Cana-san...
That makes Juvia... happy...
Juvia!
I can't believe her...
Instead of surviving herself, she chose to let her comrade live on...
Freed!
Damn it, there's too many people.
I can't find Laxus's smell.
Listen up Natsu, Gajeel...
If you get caught in Freed's runes, this will all be for nothing.
When you leave here, split up, got it?
One of these days I'll get my revenge on Salamander,
but first, I'll crush that arrogant thunder blow hard.
I've got quite a bone to pick with him.
Got a problem with that, Master Ivan?
Gajeel...
Right now, earning their trust is most important.
Don't get found out.
Act completely as a member of Fairy Tail, no matter what.
I'm already doin' that.
Fairy Tail's punishment will come later.
Roger...
Nee-chan, that's enough.
I can walk by myself.
I wasn't able to do anything, so this is the least I can do.
Nee-chan...
Don't you even understand the basics?
What?
No matter how powerful your spells are, if they don't hit your opponent, they're worthless.
Card Magic!
Heaven! Reverse Death! Mountain!
Summoned Lightning!
Ecriture of Darkness.
Rejection!
What's that?
That's... Cana!
You're a stubborn one.
Definitely one of the guild's old guard.
Take it back!
Take back what you said about Juvia being Phantom's woman!
Cana!
Damn it, what the hell is going on?
Stop it, Freed!
Why, you...
Elfman!
You lost to Eve.
You have no right to join back in the game.
Shut up!
That's enough!
Aren't we on the same team?
We once were, yes.
But those relationships no longer apply during this game
since our purpose is to change the guild.
Here, Laxus's enemy is my enemy.
Enough talking!
What's this?
It is forbidden for someone who has lost already to re-enter this game.
Those who break the rules will receive torture worse than death.
Ecriture of Darkness.
Pain.
Those letters will become your reality... Will become your every sensation...
Elfman!
Stop this, Freed!
Elfman can't fight anymore!
Ecriture of Darkness.
Fear!
Suffering!
Please!
I'll do anything!
Just, save him!
Pain! Pain! Pain!
Pain! Pain! Pain!
No!!
Ecriture of Darkness.
Annihilation!
Death?
Let's go home, Elf-niichan!
Lisanna!
Oh... This is odd...
I can't move... my body...
Don't speak!
Mira-nee... Where are you?
Right here.
Mira... nee...
You know...
I really...
See...
Lisanna...
Lisanna!
Lisanna!
What is this magical power?
Mirajane...
Ecriture of Darkness.
Wings!
Begone.
So this is the Take Over of the Demon Mirajane?
Satan Soul!
Darkness Stream!
Ecriture of...
I have no choice but to use the forbidden technique...
You need a demon to beat a demon!
Ecriture of Darkness!
Darkness!
Evil Spark!
W-What incredible magical power...
I had heard the rumors, but...
Is this really the same Mirajane?
But I cannot lose!
Darkness Breath!
Darkness Flare Bomb!
Did I get her?
What's that?
She's enveloping herself in river water?
How much magical power does she have?
Evil Explosion!
Soul Extinction!
Freed!
I-I can't win!
So this is the true power of the demon...
Mira-nee!
W-What are you going to do?
There's no point to this battle.
Arrogance of the victor, Mirajane?
Finish me off.
We're allies.
Members of the same guild.
We smile together.
And have a good time together...
And move forward, together...
Shut up!
My only ally is Laxus!
He's not the only one, right?
You've already realized this, Freed...
Although I don't believe relying on one person alone is completely bad...
There are lots of people all around you.
And those people are always connected with one another.
See? If you stretch out your hand, they're so close...
When people realize that it's lonely being alone, they'll become kind.
And you've realized it.
I didn't... want to do this...
We know.
Next year, let's enjoy the Harvest Festival together, okay?
Nee-chan...
You just can't beat her...
Freed vs. Mirajane: Both remove themselves from contention.
Battle of Fairy Tail...
Only one left... Laxus!
That time we laughed, saying we're both like each other,
we even kindly overlooked the little lies.
If we lose a place to go back to together, I don't care.
Because I'll protect that smile.
The meetings and partings numerous as the stars in the sky...
All the things I don't want to lose...
Right now I feel like I don't need any of them.
I just want to see you by my side,
all my happiness and sadness.
Let's start from here.
Let's start our tomorrow.
Let's do it like we've just been reborn.
Like flowers blown in a summer wind,
let us bloom brightly in this instant.
Finally, it's the showdown with Laxus!
Yeah! I'm all fired up!
Wouldn't it be better for you just to take a nap, Natsu?
It's usually the main character that beats the final boss like this.
What're you talkin' about?
Then, who's the main character?
You, Happy?
That may be the case...
Next time: Clash at Kardia Cathedral!
Hold it!
Trying to hog the spotlight, huh?
No fair!
When you consider my star power, it's only natural.
