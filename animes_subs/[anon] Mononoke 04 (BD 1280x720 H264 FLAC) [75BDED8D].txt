ED
Men are transient.
Time is hollow.
The sea is volatile.
Headed for the same port, we travel across the shifting waves.
Strange things occur, and we suspect one another.
Ayakashi, Mononoke, Umi Bozu.
As long as darkness exists within the hearts of men, there will always be more.
Let them come, for my invitation is what they fear most.
The blue moon illuminated
your wandering shadow.
I could never tell you all I wanted to say.
It was so very frustrating.
I think about your faked smile,
and forget all the hot tears we shed.
What do these empty husks,
those empty eyes of yours, reflect, my dear?
The transient quarter moon
hides in a rift in the clouds,
as darkness seeps up from the ground.
Tell me the truth, please.
Are you so despondent
that you still sit alone, sighing?
The Second Act
The Medicine Seller did indeed exorcise the Ghost Cat from the Sakai mansion,
but the Sakai family were all killed.
Just who did he save, in the end?
Whose side is he on?
With a face like that,
it will be a wonder if you ever marry.
Thats none of your business!
Not that youd tell me the truth, but let me ask anyway.
You didnt change the compasss heading, did you, Mr. Medicine Seller?
I wonder.
Even if I did not tamper with the compass,
the fact remains that I have been taken to the Dragons Triangle, the Ayakashis Sea.
By whom?
Is that sword alive?
I wonder.
You know, Mr. Medicine Seller, I understand that youre a powerful man,
but dont you think that aloof attitude of yours is a little over the top?
That kind of thing does nothing to impress us girls!
Right, right.
You said before that Ayakashi and Mononoke are different, right?
Arent they pretty much the same, though?
As you said, the Ayakashi are similar to Gods in that there are countless numbers of them.
Just as there are men and beasts and birds in this world,
there are many types of Ayakashi, which exist outside of our plane.
Are Ayakashi the ghosts of dead people?
In some cases.
The ghost ship we fought off was.
However, since tools and objects have souls as well, their variations are multifarious indeed.
No matter how they came to be, though, an Ayakashis reason for being is beyond human understanding.
Then, what about Mononoke?
Do you know what the ke” in Mononoke refers to?
If I knew, would I be asking?
It means disease.”
And the mono” refers to their godly nature.
Then, Mononoke haunt people like a disease?
Vengeance, sadness, fear.
What would happen if an Ayakashi were to unite with a strong human emotion?
It would become incredibly powerful, unhindered by attempts to seal it.
But your Sword of Exorcism could still kill it?
But without the Mononokes
Form, Truth and Regret, you cannot draw it.
What do you mean by truth” and regret”?
Truth is the state of the object.
Regret is the state of the soul.
I see, the state of things, is it
So, are there Mononoke here, as well as Ayakashi?
Egad, those monks are positively useless!
Be it Ayakashi or Mononoke, I will vanquish this one.
Come with us, please!
I will be right there.
Still
This could be problematic.
So many Onibi!
Its nice to have some light, but its still awfully creepy.
Theres something coming from the bow!
Thats an Ayakashi!
It looks like I should be able to cut it.
Ah, its an Ayakashi! Its flying!
Thats an Umizatou.
You wont be able to kill it with a sword.
Then what shall we do?
It will ask a question.
It will ask if it is frightening.
You must not answer that it is.
Tell it that it is not frightening.
Then will it leave?
Oh, um, wait
Oh, thats right!
I dont know what lies at the end of this journey.”
Tell it that is what you fear most.
Denizens of this ship, answer me this!
Here it comes.
I will question you one by one.
Refuse to answer, and you will be forced to wander the sea as the living dead!
Then, ask away!
Ready?
YYes.
What is it that you fear?
ThThat I dddont know what lies at the eend of
What do you truly fear?
Really, its that Ill lose all my mmmoney, and Ill become a penniless beggar!
WWait
Oh no, my precious goldfish!
I built an aquarium in the ship to carry them all this way!
What do you fear most?
I fear nothing in this world.
Since I inherited this sword, I have spilled the blood of a hundred men.
Hes nothing but a murderer.
Ive always wanted to kill an Ayakashi.
Thats impossible.
Sasaki Hyouei,
how dare you kill me.
Hyouei-san
Youre all dead! Youre dead!
You killed us all, Sasaki Hyouei!
Leave me be!
I didnt do it!
IIt was my sword! I just want to get to Edo!
Mr. Samurai!
I suppose that means he was lying when he said he feared nothing.
He must always have been afraid of those he killed in the past.
Do you go crazy if you lie to it?
Do you become like them?
Judging from their expressions, youre shown all your worst fears.
Then its the same whether you lie or tell the truth!
What should I do?
If the problem lies within you, no-one else can help.
Thats so weird.
Woman!
What do you fear most?
OOh dear, right now I fear you the most!
I wonder, though. What do I really fear most?
Tell me!
DDont rush me!
Um, Ive never really been in love, even.
I should have so many wonderful experiences ahead of me.
Ill marry a wonderful guy, and have a bunch of cute children
But, I suppose what I fear most is that Ill die without ever having done any of that.
NNo!
I dont want to get married! I dont want to have a baby like that!
Calm yourself.
All the Umizatou shows you is an illusion.
It is merely a bad dream.
Your true self does not change.
Mr. Medicine Seller
I suppose Im next.
What do you fear most?
II
What I fear most is
PPPastries!
Im afraid of pastries.
Hes just lying.
Look at this!
Its so plump and delici
I wonder what hes seeing.
Maybe I dont want to know.
Now then, of the three of us, who will have to answer the Umizatou next?
Ask me. I will answer.
What is it that you fear most?
What I fear most is
the knowledge that the edge of this world exists without Form, Truth or Regret.
Mr. Medicine Seller?
The Mononokes Sea, where the Ayakashi roam
Why was this ship sent to this sea?
Let me ask you.
II
What do you truly fear?
WhWhat I truly fear is
What I truly fear is
Genkei-sama.
Eh?
Genkei-sama is a wonderful master,
but so many unusual things have happened on this trip to Edo.
That is true.
We were chanting all night, but then
Sougen.
YYes, Genkei-sama?
Are you feeling seasick, after this long journey?
No, I
If you are, then go get some fresh air.
Get some fresh air.
I understand.
I see.
I had failed him,
and I left.
My master was the only one
who could have placed the magnet near the compass.
Why did you do that?
I did not want to involve you all,
but no ship dared take me to the Dragons Triangle, no matter how I pleaded.
You are trembling.
Why would you want to come here so badly, though it terrifies you so?
Umizatou, ask your question!
What do you fear?
What is it?
Hes been waiting for this.
For fifty years, I have trembled in fear every time Ive thought of it.
It is within this sea.
It has wandered this sea constantly, and even changed it, that the Ayakashi might swarm to it.
What is it?
It is
What made the Ayakashis Sea!
The
The Utsurobune on which my sister sailed, fifty years ago.
Is the Umizatou gone?
Whats an Utsurobune?
Well, its a sort of ship made by hollowing out a large tree.
Then, the hull is a cave?
If you get on a ship like that, youll never be able to get out!
Right. You couldnt get out.
Thats the kind of ship it is.
Eh?
Genkei-san, why would your sister get on a ship like that?
The sound of chains!
The chains that bound the Utsurobune!
Is that an illusion, too?
Its the Utsurobune!
Its not an illusion! I can see it, too!
Genkei-sama, what happened fifty years ago?
Why did your sister get into that Utsurobune?
How can such a small ship make such huge waves?
What is this sound?
Its coming from inside.
Its a person!
Theres someone in there!
Shes been in there for fifty years? Thats impossible!
I cant take it! I cant I cant stand such fear!
What are this Mononokes Truth and Regret?
What are this Mononokes Truth and Regret?
What are this Mononokes Truth and Regret?
Let me ask you that.
Forgive me, Oyou.
I have not forgotten you even once in the last fifty years.
You went into the Utsurobune in my place of your own accord,
and were taken to the Dragons Triangle.
Why?
Why do you harbor such hatred, that you could change the sea and draw all these Ayakashi?
Why is it?
The Mononokes Form
has arrived.
To be continued
Without you, I just cant smile.
I walk this banal town,
feeling such intense emotions.
I know that if I could treasure them and live on,
I would need nothing else.
The summer flowers that bloomed in the sky
Come falling down, dancing in the wind.
I can barely recall the night sky
where they all came tumbling down,
so what I can still recall is all the more precious.
