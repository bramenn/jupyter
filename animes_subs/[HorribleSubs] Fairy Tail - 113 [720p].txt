The S Class Wizard Advancement Exam was held on Tenroujima.
I ended up participating as Cana's partner after she confessed something to me.
But during the exam Zeref appeared!
And Grimoire Heart came to attack!
What in the world is going to happen?!
Cana acquired one of the 3 Grand Spells of the guild, Fairy Glitter.
But it wasn't enough to stand up to the magic power
of the second-in-command of Grimoire Heart, Bluenote.
Cana was facing a truly dire situation.
But that's when Cana's father, Gildarts, returned!
This guy... He's Gildarts.
Father...
Gildarts!
Get away from this place.
What?!
Tenrou Tree.
I've never seen Gildarts this angry.
The tension in the air is incredible!
Go!
The ground's...
Incredible...
How much magic power do the both of them have?!
Thank you, Carla...
Huh? I didn't exactly cover for you.
I was pushed back? Me?!
It won't come off!
Sheesh!
I think maybe we should get away from here, like he said.
Y-Yeah...
But...
Let's go.
We would just get in Gildarts's way here.
This guy...
So strong!
I wanna see this fight!
We're leaving, Natsu!
Be careful, Father.
Cana, hurry up!
It was a very important exam...
It meant much more to the kids than the adults knew.
The determination of those kids to step out into tomorrow...
You trampled all over it!
Argh! I wanna see how the fight ends up!
Right now, joining up with everyone else comes first!
Yeah...
If we go to the camp, everyone might be there.
We've got to regroup and prepare, or else...
And Mest-san... I mean, Dranbalt-san will surely help us!
That guy?
Cana, are you okay?
Yeah, thank you.
This is Fairy Tail's base camp, where Natsu's group is heading.
The wounded members are carried here.
However...
I am one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory, Rustyrose!
I'll devour every last Fairy!
Lisanna, we're gonna protect everyone back there!
Understood! I'm not going to let him lay a finger on Mira-nee!
I can only maintain my battle form for a short time.
I have to finish this quickly.
Women, a cat, and the wounded?
Honestly, this doesn't seem like it'll be a particularly dramatic event.
Too bad...
Even if it's the injured, I will not hold back.
I will crush you all!
What the hell?
You're just picking on the weak!
The strongest Dark Guild, my butt!
Don't you feel any shame?!
Is that how you do things, huh?
We will sacrifice as many people as it takes to create our ideal world.
And besides, no weaklings are meant to survive there.
You will never create an ideal world that way!
Yes! We learned that first-hand in Edolas!
Then use your powers and try to stop me!
You should try to shake my fragment much, much more!
Cry! Scream!
Those voices will be your requiem!
Who the hell are you?!
Fried! Bickslow!
You came back?!
We noticed the signal flare.
We came back together with Gildarts.
Gildarts is back, too?
I'll turn the whole bunch of you into tragic memorial stardust!
We never planned on fighting you fair and square.
The two of us together will wipe you out completely.
By hurting Ever and our comrades, you have sinned.
Rules do not apply to you.
Baryon Formation!
In my left hand dwells a shield of gold that defends against all!
Within my feet dwell Pegasus's wings!
You think you can beat the power of imagination?
You think you can beat my infinite power?!
Sacred Guardian Beast, Gale Belfast!
Mow them all down! Make my fragment shake!
What... is that?
Summoning magic... Wait, I can sense a different kind of magic.
Fried! Bickslow!
Be careful!
No need to remind us!
Seith Magic! Human Possession!
Crumble!
Impossible!
Ecriture of Darkness!
Darkness!
What the...
Now that's the Raijinshuu!
That's how they are when they fight seriously...
They really are amazing!
Stand up.
You have no path to forgiveness.
M-My fragment... It fears?
The giant tree, which makes its roots on Tenroujima...
There at its roots, the two strong warriors finally meet.
Erza and Azuma.
You finished off Wendy?!
And not just that girl.
All of your comrades should be getting destroyed by my allies right now.
Don't be ridiculous!
We have Natsu and Mirajane here as well!
So you couldn't...
I don't know about this wizard you call Natsu...
Perhaps you think I am lying?
I will find out for myself with my own two eyes!
I have good luck.
Demon Mirajane, and now Titania, Erza Scarlet.
How lucky I am to destroy both myself!
Further inside the island, Ultear met Gray and told him something shocking.
I don't understand.
You wanted to meet me?
I'm your ally?
That's right.
I've been searching for you all this time...
You were the most loved of Ul's students, and I am Ul's daughter!
We're almost like little brother and big sister.
W-What?! B-Brother and s-sister?!
Y-You're my sister?!
I mean it's kind of like that.
Of course I have no reason to hate you...
Hold it!
I'm not going to buy this all of a sudden!
You're our enemy, right?!
It's true that I'm a member of Grimoire Heart...
But even though we stand against each other, I'm sure that we can speak heart to heart.
Both of us follow the path Ul set out for us, after all.
The battle on Tenroujima headed toward its conclusion.
We all believed...
We believed we'd be victorious.
That's what we believed.
Fear... Catastrophe!
My fragment... It fears?!
But, no problem.
This is not bad!
Fear causes my power... my imagination to build up!
Go forth, spirits of Prettia!
Devour the Fairies' souls!
Here come more weird things!
Be careful, you two!
They're clinging to my body!
Does he mean his magic can turn anything he imagines into reality?!
How in the world can you fight against that?
This guy uses some creepy magic!
Fried and Bickslow...
Oh, I remember now. You two are part of the Raijinshuu, right?
Those groupies of Master Makarov's grandson,
who was expelled for trying and failing to take control of the guild.
What was his name again? Oh yeah, Laxus, I think.
Bastard.
A contemptible scoundrel like you has no right to utter Laxus' name!
Bastard...
Now, this guy can fly!
BLEVE!
Venus Photon Slicer!
What's so funny?
I've been waiting for someone strong like you.
This is fun.
I hear of your bravery quite often.
I think you and I may be of the same breed, where the fight is everything.
Only searching for those who are truly strong...
Sorry, but I cannot agree with that.
I do not search out those who are strong.
Not true.
You would never have obtained such strength unless you did.
As long as I have the power to protect my friends, that's all I need.
If I could trade for that power, I wouldn't care how weak I was.
I guess... that's contradictory.
You are an interesting one.
I wish I could fight you fair and square.
What do you mean?
I mean that time is up.
What?
My magic is of the forest. Tree magic.
The Lost Magic, Great Tree Ark.
My explosions are caused by using the magic of the great land to compress tree roots.
But the true power of this magic
is to root into the ground and to control the magic power residing in the great land.
Control the magic of the land?!
There was but one reason for me to arrive on this island before everyone else.
It was so I could prepare to take control over this island's magic.
What are you saying?
It is not what I would have wished for, but I cannot disobey a direct order.
W-What have you done, you fiend?!
What in the... The Tenrou Tree!
T-The island! The island is crumbling!
No!
It's that giant tree that's crumbling!
This is bad...
Maybe I should have forced them to evacuate after all!
Wendy, Natsu...
I hope you stay safe!
What the heck is happening?!
Carla, hurry!
You, too!
We have to hurry back to the camp!
Huh?
W-What is...
I feel so weak...
It's like all my energy is...
No...
What's going on?
Azuma, huh?
W-What is this?
All my power is disappearing!
What in the world...?
Fried, Bickslow!
Changing Stream!
The flow has reversed!
I will have the last laugh!
What's happening?
I can't bring out any of my power!
Damn it... I can't summon any power...
Crap! What's happening?
Damn you, old man... You gave Azuma some strange orders, didn't you?
Gildarts. Makarov... You have a fine chess piece in your possession.
To think someone else could stop Bluenote other than I.
It did take quite some time, but have you taken control over the magic of Tenroujima?
With this, Fairy Tail has lost even its slightest chance of victory!
Master Hades knows the power of this island well.
What?
The giant tree growing in its center, the Tenrou Tree...
It provides divine protection to those with the Fairy Tail mark,
and protects them from dying while on the island.
It has a special ability to amplify magic power.
So that's why the master has the exam on this island.
And you destroyed the Tenrou Tree?!
Yes. That nullified the divine protection on your lives.
And now, I am stealing away the magic power of every Fairy Tail wizard.
That's an elegant visual, fitting for all of you.
That's insane!
I don't believe you...
It's already complete.
Fairy Tail has surely been wiped out.
But...
Although I control the magic of the island, I have left you as you were.
Now then, Titania...
Your friends are at death's door around the island!
You are the only one who can save them!
Let's just see how great this power is that you have to protect your friends.
But man, the tree in the middle of this island is seriously big.
What kind of tree is it?
Aye!
It's called the Tenrou Tree, but I've never heard of that before.
Its name sounds strong!
Is it strong?
I don't think trees are strong or weak, really.
Wait... I bet if I punched it, it'd start moving or something!
Please, don't even think about that!
Next time: Erza vs. Azuma!
And anyway, if a big tree like this moved, you'd be squished flat, Natsu.
It's not like a tree can move around, anyway.
You're the one who brought it up!
