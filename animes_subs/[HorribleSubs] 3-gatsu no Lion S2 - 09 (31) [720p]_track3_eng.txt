Kingdom (Part 1)
COMFY
Wow!
Rei.
Good luck at the Newcomer Tournament finals tomorrow.
And so...
Here. Pork Cut'let's win!
PORK CUT'LET'S WIN
TA-DAA
Thank you for the
Delicious!
It's crispy!
And juicy!
Momo's cutlet is cut in cubes.
Yummy!
I know, right?
I cracked a raw egg on top of the hot pork cutlet.
So you're going to Osaka tomorrow?
For events like that, you arrive the day before, right?
Yes. The Kansai Shogi Hall has a few rooms available, so I'll be staying there.
And Hina, your bullet train leaves at eight tomorrow, right?
You have to be at school by seven?
NOM NOM
You have an early morning, so why don't I draw the bath?
Uh, okay.
Hina, buy me a souvenir!
Sure.
That's right. Hina's school trip is from tomorrow.
Two nights and three days in Kyoto.
Thank you for dinner.
Oh, what's wrong? You're done already?
I don't know what it is, but my stomach hurts.
Are you all right? Maybe it was too greasy.
It's unusual for you to have a stomachache.
Want some medicine?
Yeah.
Hina, that's...
You said your stomach hurts?
There. Lie on your right side.
Warming your back like this may make you feel a little better.
Yeah. Thank you.
Is she sick?
HMM HMM
Are you okay, Hina?
When I thought about her situation at school,
I can imagine how this three-day, two-night trip would be painful.
It was plain as day.
Are you okay? You know, you don't have to go to Kyoto.
No, I'll go.
I have a feeling that I need to go.
It feels like if I don't,
I'll regret it down the line, years from now, even after becoming an adult.
I think I wanted to have memories of not running away.
So, I can't explain it well,
but you wanted to get rid of things like that, right?
That one time, Takahashi immediately said he understood.
Hina...
I'm going to win.
I swear I'll win.
Nikaidou kept playing until he collapsed.
And the girl in front of me...
I swear I'll win before I come home.
When your stomach feels better, let's all go to a sweets shop.
You can have whatever toppings you like.
Thank you, Kiriyama.
They're all fighting to win...
Huh? Where am I?
Oh, that's right.
It's Osaka.
I came here to fight.
The Newcomer Tournament is open to shogi players who are 26 and under,
and 5th dan and under.
Each player is given five hours.
The match will probably continue until night time.
To be on the safe side, I'll buy breakfast, lunch,
and plenty of drinks.
Kiriyama is coming today, right?
Yeah. He's the guy who made our Hachi cry.
It's too bad what happened to that rich kid, but Yamazaki was going all out, too.
Yeah. After all, his unprecedented title of Eternal Newcomer King was on the line!
You can't blame him. Maintaining your health is part of the game.
Doing everything you can to beat your opponent,
no matter what condition they're in, is just etiquette.
Junkei just fought the way you're supposed to fight.
I suddenly recall what he said.
I'll have my shot at the title.
If I didn't think that, how could I go on?
I wonder how strongly Nikaidou felt...
when he said those words.
You're not mistaken, Rei Kiriyama.
Look to nature for the way of life.
This is the final match of the Newcomer Tournament.
I'm Junkei Yamazaki.
SHOGI HALL
It's quiet.
Only the sound of our pieces disturbs the air.
He's gunning for a Ranging Rook Castle.
He'll lock himself in, and intend to make this a drawn-out war.
While playing...
the question Why?...
keeps swirling around in my head.
When I looked at the game records, I sensed it.
You had plenty of moves that were open.
So why did you force a draw by repeating moves?
Because I didn't have a winning move.
You can't blame him. Maintaining your health is part of the game.
Doing everything you can to beat your opponent,
no matter what condition they're in, is just etiquette.
Junkei just fought the way you're supposed to fight.
The guys in the store said he fought the way you're supposed to fight.
But if you're not conquering your weakness of failing to read your opponent,
and then you would put that burden on someone else saying it's justified,
then I have just one reply.
Kingdom (Part 1)
Go to hell!
Two eyeballs in the dark.
They're examining my situation.
Waiting for me to make a mistake.
Waiting with bated breath...
for the moment I make a wrong move.
He waits patiently.
Like a shadow...
that I can't shake off.
Kingdom 2
In that case, I'll show you.
Whether I make a mistake or not...
I'll fling all of that mud away!
Don't try to act cool, Kiriyama!
If you really want to win, then persevere!
Don't just attack, you have to defend!
I finally caught up to you, Kiriyama.
I'll be waiting for the day when we have a match together.
Right, rival?
Kiriyama, can you hear me?
ROOK
Take better care of your shogi,
and yourself, Kiriyama!
I'm always like this.
Bravery and recklessness are similar but different!
I'm always so quick to focus on myself.
Thanks, Rei. I should be okay for the next one.
Other people's kindness, strength...
I would probably be cleaning up by myself and crying.
and loneliness.
I never...
I could never notice it.
It was frustrating.
I felt so pathetic.
Look to nature for the way of life.
Newcomer Tournament Finals
Idiot.
You really worried me there.
You did it. You did it, Kiriyama!
Yes. Yes, it was brilliant.
As expected from your dear rival, Master Harunobu.
SHOGI HALL
KANSAI SHOGI HALL
Thank you for everything.
Goodbye.
It really works! Shimada 8th-Dan gave me this stomach medicine.
Can I see? I've got stomach pain too.
It really works! When you have a stomachache because of nerves, consult Shimada 8th-Dan.
He's the authority on stomach pain.
Um, can I see that?
What, Kiriyama? You have stomach pains, too?
STOMACH MEDICINE
Want some?
Keep it. I've got plenty.
Whoa, hey, Kiriyama! Before that, congratulations!
You're the Newcomer King!
Uh... huh?
Kiriyama?
Suddenly the only thing I could think about
was Hinata, curled up like a little ball on the floor the night before last.
To the Parents School Trip Schedule
Kiyomizu Temple Heian Temple Lunch Free Time (Shinkyougoku) Ginkakuji Dinner
Kyoto Station is just one stop away with the bullet train!
Will I make it?
No, I'll go.
I have a feeling that I need to go.
It feels like if I don't,
I'll regret it down the line, years from now, even after becoming an adult.
To Shinkyougoku!
GIFT SHOP
NISHIKI TENMANGUU
UMINO SHOP
Damn it!
She's not here?
Of course she's not.
Like I could find a middle school student who doesn't have a phone
KYOTO GIFTS
in a town I barely know by running around randomly,
with free time in Shinkyougoku as my only hint.
What the hell am I doing?
What should I do?
- I can't make up my mind. - I know, right?
Oh, no way, that's totally cute!
Hina's middle school uniform.
Hey, where's Kiriyama?
I don't know. It's fine, right?
This is our free time. So he's free to do what he wants.
Oh, that's right.
I remember.
Not here.
Among this laughter,
someone who's all alone won't be found.
She couldn't be here.
That's right.
Whenever she feels like crying,
she heads for the river...
by herself.
Rei?
How?!
Why? What are you doing here?
How?!
Um... Well, uh, let's see...
You said your stomach hurt,
so I was wondering if you were okay.
So... Oh! That's right.
A colleague gave me a very effective stomach medicine, so...
H-Hina.
Hina, you've been hanging in there. I'm proud of you.
Hina loudly burst into tears
and didn't stop.
She got warmer and warmer.
Her uniform and head became sweaty.
The breeze off the river on this slightly cloudy day was chilly,
so I was worried she would catch a cold.
I was worried...
just so worried...
that I couldn't help it.

I thought maybe it was a dream.
I was in a strange town, all alone,
feeling lonely, and about to cry,
you came running over, out of breath, and with wind-tousled hair,
and stood before me.
ILLUSTRATION: MINEO MAYA
School trips bring back memories!
And when I think of Kyoto,
I think of tea, mochi shops, and Yatsuhashi!
Oh, I can't stop thinking about it!
