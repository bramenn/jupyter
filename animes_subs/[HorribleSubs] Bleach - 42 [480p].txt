Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
My love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Zabimaru
You still cant get up?
Thats pitiful!
You show up after all this time, and this is what I get.
You couldve said something nicer.
Ive already recovered. Im able to fight any time.
Now its your turn.
Get off your back and get well, already!
And let us fight that Zangetsu bastard!
The next time for sure, Ill
Ill win! ...win!
You fool Were you asleep, or something?
Hes no longer the one I must fight.
Is that so?
Then who must you fight?
Who will you fight now?
You leave me no choice.
Before it goes to your head, Ill show you
This power gap that youll never bridge,
not in a thousand years
No, Ichigo! Run!
Scatter
You!
Its been a long time, eh?
Byakuya boy.
Yoruichi Shihoin
Who is she? I dont know her.
No
Ive heard that name before.
I think it was
Former Commander of the Stealth Force and
Captain of Squad One Punishment Force,
Yoruichi Shihoin.
I havent seen you in a while.
Youve been in hiding for over a hundred years.
I thought you were dead.
Yoruichi
You came to rescue me, didnt you?
Thank you.
Sorry, though.
Step aside.
Ive got to defeat this guy.
Defeat him?
You? Defeat him?
You fool!
Wh-Whatre you doing Yorui
Medicine?
Gaten” or hoten.”
You thrust a powerful anesthetic directly into him, didnt you?
What do you intend to do with him, Yoruichi?
Ukitake
Nothing you do will help.
Theres no escaping from here.
Oh You talk like a big shot now, dont you? Byakuya boy.
Have you ever once beaten me at tag”?
Would you like to try me?
Did you think you could escape with such a slow Flash Step?
Did you think you could capture me with such a slow Flash Step?
Three days.
In three days, Ill make this boy stronger than you.
This fight is postponed until then.
Give chase, if you wish.
Flash Master” Yoruichi
wont be caught by the likes of you yet.
They got away
Uh Hey!
Wherere you going, Byakuya?
Didnt you come to capture the ryoka?
Ive lost interest.
Do what you want now.
Good grief, hes as willful as ever.
R-Rukia!
The tension drained out of her when Byakuya left.
Its only natural.
Hey! Sentaro! Kiyone! Come out here!
You called, Captain, sir?!
So you did follow me. How long were you there?
From the time you said, My, my, how dangerous,”
and stopped Captain Kuchiki, Captain, sir!
From the very start, then?
Didnt I tell you not to come because it was dangerous?
Forgive me, sir!
I respect you so very much, that I simply had to follow you here!
No fair, Kotsubaki!
Captain! I feel the same! I love y
N-No! I respect you very much!
Ha-h?! I respect him much, much more than you, by far!
Ha-ah?! Shut up, Mt. Fuji-head!
Wanna fight, booger-face?!
Fine with me!
Well, never mind.
Anyhow, Kiyone, contact 4th Squad. One apprehended. Wounded.
Yes, sir.
Send for an advanced relief squad ASAP.
Huh?
Sentaro, you take Kuchiki back to the cell.
Yes, sir.
Move.
N-No! I cant let Rukia go back in there
Move! Damned booger!
You think Im doing this because I want to?!
Sorry, Kuchiki
The captain and I will appeal to the top brass afterwards
and get you out of the cell.
Huh?!
Be patient until then.
No fair, Kotsubaki!
I worry much, much more about Kuchiki than you!
Kuchiki, the captain and I will promise, promise to get you out, all right?!
Why do you keep copying what I say?!
Wanna fight, copycat?!
Any time!
You hurry up and call 4th Squad!
Shut up! I was just about to!
Uhsir
You want to know why Im helping you?
Uhyes.
Of course, Ill help you.
We dont know who killed Aizen yet.
And its very likely that you outsiders know something about it.
We cant kill you without investigating first.
And above all else
Though your methods were bad, you tried to rescue my subordinate.
I cant let you die.
No one back there, either, sir!
I see! Fine!
Hey! You men take the East Nijo area!
The ryoka are cunning! Dont lose them!
Yes, sir!
Thanks for the report!
By the way
Ive never seen you two before. Are you new?
Yes, sir!
We joined this period! Im Inoue! Please remember me, sir!
Im Ishida. Pleaseremember me, sir.
My word
Whaddya say? Why not come to my place tonight?
Sir?
You mustve heard of me. Toshimori Umesada!
This year, I made 15th in the 20-seat Ninth Squad!
Not that Im boasting,
but Im the most successful of all my comrades!
Ill treat you good
When ryoka have infiltrated, and a wartime alert has been issued,
I hardly think a squad leader has time for propositioning women.
What?! You lowly underling! You dare lecture me?!
Sir Umesada!
Nothing here, sir!
Awaiting further instructions, sir!
Dammit! Remember this!
Once this commotion is over,
Im gonna give it to you good!!
Be my guest.
By then, Ill be long gone.
Thanks, Ishida!
It wasnt much I just dislike his type.
Still, how incredible.
Aw, I wasnt that great
It worked out beautifully.
Im awesome!
Oh, right
What?! Steal the Soul Reapers clothing?!
Shh! Not so loud, Ishida!
Were just going to borrow their clothes!
Appearance-wise,
were not so different from Soul Reapers.
Only our clothes are.
If we can look like them, well be able to get around more easily.
So we need their clothes?
Yes, were borrowing them!
But
Here they come!
When I say, Go,” okay?
Ready, set, go!
AhhI forgot to jump out.
Ms. Inoue
Oh! Here, your clothes.
I was quite surprised.
You knocked those two out without using your spirit powers.
Youre surprisingly strong, arent you?
Oh, really? Eh, heh, heh.
Actually, I learned a little karate from Tatsuki.
Huh?
She said I had the skills of a first-level student.
Sh-She did?
Now, then. Wed better get changed!
W-W-Wait! Wait, Ms. Inoue!
Huh?
OhI see. Sorry, sorry!
Boys and girls cant dress in the same room, can they?
I just felt like I was with Tatsuki
Ohwell I
That being the case, here!
Ishidas Special Dressing Room” Comfy” Spacious”
Go right in!
Shouldnt it be the other way around?
Ishida! Ready? Open up!
W-Wait!
Now, then
I got those two to tell me
about the Senzaikyu where Kuchiki is being held.
The others must already be headed there.
Even Kurosaki He might already have gotten there.
I see. Wed better hurry, then.
Weve got to help him before he screws up, all alone.
Right!
What squad shall we say were from?
Oh Yes
We should be able to answer quickly if were asked, right?
Ummyoure right
Maybe its because I havent fought in a hundred years.
Im breathing hard after only a hundred Flash Steps or so.
How weak Ive grown.
Oh, youre awake, Ichigo?
Where am I?
Why?
Whyd you bring me back alone?!
I was the one with the best chance of surviving back there!
Now Ganju, Hanataro, and Rukia will all be killed!
Dont be so vain.
No one back there had any chance against Byakuya.
You!
Be still! Do you want to open up those wounds again?
Gotohell
One person was all I could carry and get away from Byakuya.
Then why didnt you take Rukia instead of me?
True
Back then, no one there had any chance of defeating Byakuya.
But you alone have the ability to.
Thats why I brought you back.
Besides, Ukitake was there, too.
Hes Rukias superior, with a strong sense of obligation.
Though youre insurgents,
hed never blindly kill anyone who came to save Rukia.
So, Ichigo, dont worry. Grow strong here.
As you are now, youd never defeat Byakuya.
But Ill train you so that you can.
Then go back and rescue everyone with your own hands!
Hows the pain?
Its much better than earlier.
We cant wait for you to recover completely.
It might hurt, but you must do this.
Right!
I dunno if Ive seen this place before
Youre the first outsider Ive ever brought here.
Impressive, huh?
Huhh
Well, never mind.
Times short, right? Lets get started!
Fine. Now
First, are you aware that your zanpaku-to
is already in released mode?
It is?
Released mode, like Kenpachi Zarakis?
No wonder its shape was different from other peoples swords.
And it never transformed when I called its name
Humph. You werent aware of it, after all?
Then you dont know Zangetsu can be released to another level?
Huh?!
Not just Zangetsu.
All zanpaku-to swords can be released to two levels.
The first release is called Shikai.” The second release is Bankai.”
To perform these two releases,
thats a requirement for squad captains.
Requirement?
Right.
Except for one,
all squad captains of the Court Guard have mastered Bankai.”
One?
Kenpachi Zaraki.
In the vast history of the Soul Society,
hes about the only one to become captain without achieving Bankai”
or even knowing the name of his zanpaku-to.
It shows how greatly the 13 Court Guard Squads must value
his fighting prowess and tenacity.
Having fought him, you should know that best of all.
The difference in power between the Shikai and Bankai levels,
though dependent on each fighters ability and discipline,
can be considered roughly five to ten times greater.
Ten times?
An amazing increase, right?
Thats why, in order to achieve Bankai,”
even strong fighters train for over 10 years.
W-Wait a minute!
I aint got time! I know!
But there is a way.
Itll be pretty dangerous,
but youll use a completely different method and master Bankai” in three days!
Three days?!
Happy people
Come on, come on, come on
Happy people
Here we go!
Everybody stand up! Everybody fight!
Within your heart, you may feel uneasy
But keep your head right up!
To the sky!
No matter when (Oh yeah!)
No matter where (Oh yeah!)
Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!)
Ill be here for you
Happy people in the house!!!
With a tough smile
Happy people in the house!!!
Lets live!
Wow
Happy people in the house
All right
Happy people
Ishida, what squad shall we say we are?
Does each squad have a unique characteristic?
Im sure!
Like a squad that loves flowers, or a musical squad,
or a squad that tells great jokes.
Inoue, you dont understand a Soul Reapers work, do you?
