Shichimiya.
You can't do things like this.
You just can't!
I have no experience when it comes to romance...
Shichimiya.
As dense as I am, seeing her tears were enough to make me realize.
I realized what Shichimiya had been attempting to make war with.
Why she asked me those questions, and why she made me say those things.
The water mage's attack has intensified. Rescue requested.
And why she wept.
What are you doing?
New discovery. I would like to commence exploration.
Forget it. You haven't brought your umbrella.
Kuzuha said...
What does Kuzuha have to do with anything?
Just duck under here.
You're freezing.
Dark beings always maintain a low body temperature.
I'm coming in.
I made you some rice gruel. Try to eat some.
EPISODE XI BLUE MOON RAGNAROK
Can you sit up?
The real world is becoming distorted!
Is it due to the weakened state of Wicked Lord Shingan?!
Hey, you okay?
You still have a fever.
I want you to stay in bed for another day.
I cannot afford to.
Listen, you have a cold.
Remember how you tried to go out yesterday...
Ugh, the world is banishing me.
I am fine now. A night's sleep has fully restored me.
No way. You are grounded until you're all better.
Where are you trying to go anyway?
That I cannot answer. I have said so before.
I put the question to you as Dark Flame Master! Where do you go?
It's not like I'll do anything with that information, you know.
I just don't like you going off somewhere...
Forgive me.
But soon, all will be revealed.
Master!
How could you perish this way and leave me alone?!
It's d-d-death!
She is not dead!
She'll be better soon, right?
If I were so inclined...
Gasp! Do you mean that to recover...
Please don't provide her with a scenario.
Stay back or you'll catch her cold.
Master! I'll be waiting for you!
I swear this to you!
Thank you both, but we can't have you catching her cold.
That's true.
See you around, Chimera.
Take care of that cold. I'm sure you have stacks of homework to do.
You spoke what must remain unspoken.
What do you mean?!
Tell them the cat ate your homework.
I want to know about Sophia.
Huh?
I made several attempts to contact her through her electro-protocol code...
O-oh, really? I wonder what's wrong?
She said she was really busy.
He's so transparent.
From the moment Shichimiya said she was going to make war...
You're saying you realized?
It was easy to tell.
All that girl ever looked at was you.
Actually, it was Toka who told us about it.
So? What are you gonna do about it?
Do about it?
You can't just leave her like that.
That girl is in love with you.
How am I supposed to know what to do?
I never even had a girlfriend before now.
MYSTERY JEWEL 298 YEN
Don't get defiant with me.
I'm just being honest. What should I do?
Pardon?
Aren't women supposed to know about this sort of thing?
H-how am I supposed to know?
Chicken.
I'm not chickening out.
Then stay out of it.
You're always such a busybody, like that time with Rikka.
I help you guys out when you need it!
I never asked for your help.
Do what you want. See if I care!
Kumin-senpai, let's go.
What?
What?
Ow!
What the hell?!
It's nothing!
Don't knock people over for nothing!
It's nothing, but it's also something!
Who do you think you are? Dekomori?! It's nothing, but it's also something!
What?
Shichimiya!
Hero!
What is she doing?
Whoa, hey!
I have returned!
What do you think you're doing? You could have died!
Ripples and magical energy were vital...
I get it!
Please don't accept that.
Thanks to that, I've conquered it for good!
I am 100 victorious! From now on...
It sounds like a game that's being gradually ruined by sequels.
That's why you can permanently delete what happened earlier! Let it disappear!
Shichimiya, will that do it?
Yup! That'll do it!
That's a relief.
Oh! Angel detected!
Togashi.
What?
Did you take what she just said seriously...?
You mean she isn't?
What the...?!
Why would she be fine?! She's acting tough!
How am I supposed to see that?
Just look at her!
I've hung out with her enough to know how she works!
Then what do you expect from me?!
Well...
Do you know how they say that love is like a dream?
With a dream, you eventually wake up from it.
It's hard to force yourself to wake up.
Kumin-senpai.
Where are you going?
Who cares? You're not my keeper.
What's with her?
Morisummer loves you.
What?
She loves Rikka, and Dekomori...
She loves chunibyo.
I'm a bit jealous of you guys.
I wish I could have chunibyo too.
You do?
Then I could feel the same way as all of you.
But I doubt that's how you get chunibyo.
The fact that you admire it means that you have a good case of chunibyo.
You think so?
Aren't you Wicked Lord Shingan the Second, Kumin-senpai?
YOU'VE GOT MAIL
Morisummer!
Sophia, you appear to have lost your way.
What brings you here?
Did you regain your memory?!
Wanna eat some medicinal plants?
I do not!
I expressly came wearing this uniform, hoping it would make it easier to communicate.
It's a tight fit.
Huh?
Ahem. Sophia.
I have words for you.
The words of the magician Morisummer.
Morisummer once fought someone who stole her identity...
That is when she made a realization.
She realized how one might face and fight one's other inner self face-to-face.
One's other inner self?
Yes. You must look outwards to know thyself.
Just as I found myself when I fought my imposter...
I am certain that you, too, have an opponent to face.
Find that opponent.
Morisummer.
Then your path will open before you.
Thank you.
What a total pain. Message received?
Morisummer! Thank you.
I'll give you a supply of magical energy!
You're too close! Stop that.
It's you!
Hey, Mjolnir Hammer! Come over here!
Was Dark Flame Master not enough for you?!
Do you dare mess with Fake Mori Summer as well?!
Unforgivable!
How do you feel?
Kuzuha, is the moon out?
It's a lovely full moon. It's going to be a blue moon tonight.
A blue moon.
Shichimiya is in love with me, but I love Rikka.
Forget it. It's too complex. What should I do?
Shichimiya.
Hero. Or rather Dark Flame Master!
Wanna see my magic?
Shichimiya.
I've been looking everywhere...
This is the only way to settle the score. Which means...
This is war!
But you're...
Here I come! Devil Lord, recognized!
Big Brother. Oh, Satone?
Uh, yeah.
Big Brother, Rikka is gone!
What?
I only looked away for a moment.
Why that...
What do we do?
Shichimiya.
There's a blue moon out tonight.
Yeah.
I think she probably realized that there's a blue moon out tonight.
Blue moon?
You really don't remember?
This is it!
Dark Flame Dragon?
Hero, you're the one who said that the Dark Flame Dragon...
You said you wanted it brought back to life.
To whom I am bound by the absolute contract, unchanged from long ago and for all eternity.
Even if I should travel through time and dimensions...
At this very moment, in this world of chaos...
A world I was born into by mistake...
I fear that in the not too distant future, I will pass into nothingness.
I hereby entrust thee...
With the power of its form, which can plunge this world into shadow.
With the power to consume this fallacious world...
Three keys are needed to revive the Dark Flame Dragon.
Skuld.
Belldandy.
And Urd.
You, to whom I am bound by the absolute contract.
If you indeed hold the power to share my destiny...
You, to whom I am bound for eternity. I will enter a period of slumber...
I want you to endow me with power...
Is this where it's hidden?
I only half-remember it, but it has to be around here.
I have to dig here.
What's this?
The Wicked Lord Shingan left this here.
I think these are markers to show this has already been searched.
No way.
You mean...?
I also searched for them.
I just couldn't find Urd.
The key you sent into the past.
The only way to send a key into the past is to utilize the parallel world.
According to your memo, the entrance to the parallel world...
But I didn't know which pylon to start counting from.
So, she went through each and every one?
Forgive me. But soon, all will be revealed.
All this time, she's been doing it for that?
Do you know where it is?
Yeah, but just vaguely!
I remember this street!
This way!
Rikka.
No matter how serious you were about chunibyo.
No matter how serious you were about love...
Rikka! Rikka! Rikka!
Hero.
Rikka!
Yuta.
What are you doing?!
Yuta, is this it?
Urd?
You idiot!
You went out looking for this while you're sick with a cold?!
Do you want to make it worse?!
But it said the one you are bound to...
That's no reason.
I am bound to you for eternity.
I have to find it.
I have to find it, and prove it!
Yuta?
What're you doing? You don't have to do all that!
But I'm supposed to be bound to you...
But Sophia did, so I had to...
I can't breathe.
Yuta?
Yuta, are you bound to me?
Yes, we are bound together by the absolute contract.
I broke a bone in my second summer of middle school.
So, I went and buried it inside the cast.
I'm amazed at all the effort I went through back then.
Here.
That's incredible!
Nobody could tell where it is from that clue.
It was so hard to bury it in metal that I gave up halfway.
I guess things really do stay untouched after so many years.
It's just a rock.
That is the enchanted stone that will summon the Dark Flame Dragon.
Sorta.
The blue moon.
I researched back then to find out there'd be a blue moon tonight.
Rikka. Or rather...
You, to whom I am bound for eternity!
Be destroyed, real.
Blow up, synapses.
Vanishment...
Incredible.
Hero!
Or rather, Ghelzonianses! This is war!
Let me do combat with the Dark Flame Dragon at full power!
What?
I finally realized which opponent I must fight.
My true enemy I must fight...
That is the enemy with whom I must fight!
That is the opponent with whom I must settle my score!
Shichimiya. I understand.
I am Ghelzonianses!
I am the one who will destroy the entire world and give it new form!
Magical devil girl!
You wish to retain your magic for eternity!
Observe the power of my Dark Flame Dragon...
I couldn't ask for more!
The Dark Flame Dragon never actually existed.
So it could never actually be seen.
However...
Wh-what is that?!
However...
Rikka's cold came back with a vengeance and knocked her down.
Yuta, I am going back in time to July 20th.
Impossible!
With a catastrophic amount of homework still looming...
What? Really?
I've got too much homework.
You'll miss Yumeha growing up.
I'm gonna transform!
I was unable to go visit them in Jakarta as I was told to.
And then...
How are you handling your homework?
No problem is too great for the born-again Sophia!
Shichimiya concluded her battle with the Dark Flame Dragon...
So, what exactly has changed about you?
I never change.
I am a magical devil girl, for all eternity.
In order to stay unchanged, I needed a powerful life-changing battle...
What's that supposed to mean? Wait...
Is that the natural logic of the world?
That's it. It's the natural logic of the world.
Going out to look for angels again?
Yeah. Say, Hero?
Bye-bye.
