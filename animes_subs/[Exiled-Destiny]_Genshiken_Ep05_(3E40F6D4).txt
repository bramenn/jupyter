Genshiken
I woke up and as usual forgot my cell and missed the Express.
My life reflected in the train window.
I'm sure I have something that I won't lose to anyone in Japan...
I can't run fast, though.
I'm not that strongly-built.
Here I go, at my dauntless pace.
Pass away, today's sadness, raining in the sun!
Hesitation, repetition, dreaming all night, all night.
Farewell sadness, to outer space you go!
Look to the sky and shout at the top of your lungs!
At this tempo!
Right now, at this tempo!
Genshiken Right now, at this tempo!
How the wind blows...
This sure is sudden.
And it's this semester.
At least wait until the end of the school year.
You said it.
Notice from Club Student Council
As a result of no evident activity it has been determined that...
The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture
S-She's all smiles.
That's a Kohsaka-esque smile.
You really look happy...
You can speak, you know...
Oh well, what can you do when the whole club's getting closed down?
Right?
That's true.
Yeah!
What do we do?
What's that supposed...
I guess it's legit, then?
Um...
Isn't that what it means now that they've decided?
But I only just recently joined...
I guess you should've joined the Manga Club or whatever after all.
Well, not that I'd really know.
How can you say that, Saki?
Because I'm not a member here!
Yet you're here all the time.
It ain't because I wanna be.
Even if Genshiken is dissolved, it won't solve your otaku problems...
Nothing.
I wonder why we got chosen.
Aren't there other clubs that don't appear to be active?
Being chosen before Kingaiken does certainly seem a little unreasonable.
K-Kingai?
The Society for the Study of the Present-day Food Service Industry.
What's that?
They mainly try the food at family restaurants.
That's it?
That's it.
And you're below them...
All righty.
Well, it is true that we hardly ever do anything.
I guess recycling 90 of what we used...
Yeah, well...
Hmph, you guys.
You don't have the guts to protest the council, do you?
It looks like you're just going to give in.
Hi there!
So Genshiken's going under?
I had a feeling it would happen eventually, you know.
I mean, it doesn't serve any purpose.
Kohsaka, once this place is gone come to the Manga Club.
Our arms are open!
Ohno, cosplay's the in thing.
We could really use you.
Right...
Sexual harassment.
We don't need Madarame and crew.
Is that so.
I don't like him.
Nobody likes him.
So that's it?
I can't have Kohsaka joining that guy's club.
But once this one is gone...
You'll join them?
It's not like you don't do anything.
What about that cosplay photo session at the festival?
But later on, the club council got mad at us for not arranging that beforehand.
Yeah.
They were mad, all right.
Yeah, yeah.
You guys all piss me off.
So, what's it going to be?
Come again?
Are you going to let one scrap of paper and...
Well?
Hold on, didn't you want to see Genshiken fail?
Oh yeah, I sure do.
But, I can't stand to see it happen like this!
Or to see you guys not even get mad about it...
Ohno.
Yes?
Let's go.
W-Where?
The council office! Come on, stand up.
But, right now?
Yes!
Why me?
Sex appeal!
Wh-What do you think?
I think she's totally lost it.
L-Looks like trouble.
What do we do?
I don't know if it matters anymore...
Club Student Council Of fice
Ahh, I knew you'd come...
Stick out your chest.
I can't.
Maybe that notice was a little abrupt...
I'd like you to reconsider.
Mr. Chairman, I'll handle this.
I'm Vice-chairman Kitagawa.
Let me explain the situation.
One reason is that we are at capacity for club office space.
The applications for new clubs are listed here...
Not every one of them is legitimate...
Still, announcing the closure of clubs without any previous notice is...
Wait.
There's one more important thing.
The number of clubs that hardly do anything is considerable.
That itself wouldn't be so bad...
They chat, they eat, they smoke, they drink, they nap, they store things.
These uses are unacceptable and they are extremely widespread!
Why do we have to provide precious office space to scum like that?
I don't understand it!
Uh, Kitagawa...
Furthermore, according to something I overheard today...
Scum like that will be forced to vacate with the help of the athletic clubs!
Their property will be divvied up between other clubs!
K-Kitagawa...
Hold on.
Genshiken has been investigated.
All they do in their office is play video games!
At the school festival they held what became a...
The only things of enough value to warrant a precious club office are here!
Those game systems are older ones, and they have a lot of research value.
Huh?
It may look like they're just playing, but games and anime...
Watching over its development and transformation is the main activity of...
And regarding the school festival cosplay,
it was certainly wrong to not make advance arrangements...
That alone is enough to keep it out of the doomed inactive club category.
Any way you look at it, I'd say that someone is using...
What'd you just say, you otaku?
I'm not an otaku!
Kitagawa, calm down.
Saki... Kitagawa, calm down.
Saki did the best she could.
So, how'd it go?
Isn't that obvious?
She seems even more unapproachable than usual.
S-She's dangerous right now.
Genshiken
That dick, Kitagawa...
Dick...
She's a woman...
A dried up sexless wench like her is the same as a dick.
She's the type who'd strap on a helmet...
Ouch...
Calling people otaku...
Hey, can anyone figure out what her weakness is?
Like with a wiretap, or hidden camera.
What makes you ask?
Is that really the light you see us in?
But you're all otaku.
None of us are techie otaku!
Useless...
Ow...
Besides, isn't this a personal grudge now?
That's because you guys weren't there.
We can't be careless about things about this.
Kitagawa's serious.
You're really gonna be crushed and driven out of here.
You okay with that?
We aren't...
Dammit!
Suioh University
Takana Soba discontinued
Excuse me, why isn't there any more takana soba?
I don't really know, but I guess not many people bought it?
If that's the case, I've never seen anyone buy or eat...
You know, you should ask someone above me about it.
They don't have the one you like anymore.
It's not a big deal...
Oh, I always just get this.
Hey, about those new clubs that want to start up...
You're here alone?
And early, too.
I was wondering if there's a good way to get at Kitagawa.
You're headstrong too, Saki.
I have something you may find useful.
Mr. Chairman, when did you get here?
Just now.
You know something I can use?
Yeah, listen to this.
The Variety Discussion Group?
Maybe it's a chat club?
That's absurd! It must be a joke!
Hi.
Hello.
What do you want?
Well...
Kitagawa, let's talk outside real quick.
Huh?
What gives?
Oh there's nothing to worry about.
Watch your step.
I don't trust this.
If Genshiken goes away, the first problem we'll be up against is...
Are you guys cold?
Let's go to the cafeteria, it's warm in there.
What's this about?
Winter sure has arrived.
Isn't winter great?
Huh?
I mean, summer sucks because it's so hot!
I think summer and winter both have their good points.
Yeah, but y'know, when it's hot and muggy it makes you feel all itchy.
Like on your head and... feet!
How did you know?
W-Whatever do you mean?
Oh, it's not hot...
You'd even threaten me to make sure your club can keep going?
All I'm trying to say is that summer sucks.
Just tell me how you know.
Did you hear it from someone?
I saw it with my own eyes.
It must have been about a month ago.
A month ago?
The council office door was slightly ajar...
You were putting on athlete's foot medicine...
I had a feeling I was being watched...
Now, don't you have something to say?
Or rather, aren't we the ones with the bargaining chip now?
Pardon me.
Is anything wrong, Kitagawa?
No, it's nothing...
But...
You can go back in the office...
Hey, Mr. Chairman.
What do you think about all this?
The way that notice went out about the clubs closing down.
Don't you think it's mean, not giving them a foot to stand on?
Hmm, it might have been better to go through a probation period first.
Wouldn't it?
That's what Kitagawa and I were discussing.
It looks like she understands too.
So, Mr. Chairman, let's just pretend that never happened.
Just a moment.
Kitagawa, are you sure nothing's wrong?
Nothing, really...
Is it the athlete's foot?
How did you know?
Well... sorry, I've seen it.
The medicine was sticking out of your bag.
It looks like he knew...
Wait, no, that doesn't matter!
Would you like to go out with me?
All of a sudden...
Seriously?
I'm serious, I've been waiting for the chance.
But you might catch it from a floor mat...
Fine! Infect me!
Thank goodness.
As long as we submit a written activity program, we can be re-evaluated.
At this rate, I'm sure Genshiken won't be shut down.
I guess.
But in a way it feels like this worked out too well.
Huh?
Did our chairman already know about them?
Hey!
Listen, Kasukabe.
You're saying it here?
It's not like we're cool with Genshiken shutting down.
So, well, we can at least help you.
Let us!
You guys are a riot, worse than useless!
We've already taken care of it.
Uh, you have?
Hello, porcini!
Tokino Akiyama spotted! Shall I attack?
Wait, a fool like you would never hit her at that range.
Encircle her, then...
Ah, Mr. Chairman.
It went well.
The scenario turned out a little different though.
I see.
Now the chairman and vice-chairman are an item.
Really...
Did you know about them?
No, I didn't...
But how about officially joining Genshiken, Kasukabe?
No.
That was prompt.
Mr. Chairman, there's no way she'll ever join, is there?
Well, I guess you needn't be forced into it...
You've used this office so much as it is.
You're practically a member anyway.
What do you mean?
Kohsa...
Mr. Chairman, the student council thing was weird enough...
Is it really a coincidence?
Yeah, you and Kohsaka are also a coin...
That's a lie!
I made sure I was very careful.
Don't tell me you use spy cameras?
I would never do such a thing.
Something like that would be really bad...
A ton of trouble for me!
What a bind...
What're you doing?
If I were that kind of person...
But there are no such people, are there?
I'll join.
What?
What's wrong, Kasukabe?
S-Seriously?
T-Then are you going to cosplay?
I doubt it.
I'm thrilled to be one of us.
That being said...
That was a joke...
Frigging athlete's foot couple!
Thanks to you I had to...
It sure was a surprise when you joined Genshiken, though.
It surprised me too.
Otaple.
Otaple?
I'd say it probably means otaku couple.
What'd you say?
We took no detours or shortcuts...
Only vivid dreams extended deep into the shadows.
We aren't quite grown up.
Simple but complicated glistening like marbles.
The time we could see from there sparkled, even if nothing big happened.
What we see from the marbles in our hands now is a little different...
Viva! Model Train
Viva! Mushrooms
I say we do this. Viva! Mushrooms
Thirty minutes remain.
We're out of time.
Chihiro, you're into computers.
I'll bet you know what kind of homepage draws in the most people.
Well, yes I do.
Then tell us!
We can make a homepage based on that theory!
But I don't think you'll...
This is no time to argue about it!
What? I'm not doing that!
Chihiro! What's gotten into you?
That's why I didn't want to tell you...
Fifteen minutes remain.
We've got no choice.
Huh?
Their site's lame-o!
We're about to demolish them!
WTF!
One minute remains!
What's the matter?
When you cosplayed for the school festival, where'd you get changed?
In here...
What is it?
Hey, what's wrong?
Did you see Kujiun yesterday?
Yeah, I saw it. It was crazy.
The Federation's art department is a monster!
Oh, but I saw on the homepage that the art director is setting up a new studio.
What? I'll become the executive king?
And so, it seems there's a lot of trouble brewing there now.
He stole something quite precious. Your employees.
Hey, all those otaku quotes are really stupid.
Once again I have said a worthless thing.
Knock it off!
Coming! I'm coming!
