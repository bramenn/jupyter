Why did you... kill her?
She was pregnant...
Murderer!
The child was tainted as well.
There was no saving it.
How can you...?
Oh, my God.
Ikoma!
You are...!
what are you...?
Bastard!
How dare you!
What is the meaning of this?!
Was I... trying to bite her?!
No way... am I turning into a Kabane?!
You can drop the act, monster!
Corpse wench!
Corpseless.
Anyway, launch the Iron Fortress.
The Corpses are here.
What?
Stop pushing!
Hurry, the Corpses are coming!
We're not done with the repairs!
They can't wait for us to be done!
We have to get out of here first!
Stay back!
Are you sure you don't want me to fight?
I'm sorry...
There's no mistake.
The Corpseless brought the Corpses here.
The damned jinxes.
I don't want the Corpseless here.
We should be throwing them off the train!
This has all failed so miserably.
That's not true.
Don't worry, there are no bite marks.
Thank you.
I wish I could have a sweet bun...
Is Ayame-sama here?!
I do not see her.
I shall be there shortly!
What now?
Be strong.
How are you going to take responsibility for this unmitigated disaster?
This is what happens when you trust the Corpseless!
Watch your tongue!
You are addressing the Yomokawa heir!
The people are uneasy.
They feel it may be too dangerous to leave the Iron Fortress in your hands.
You bastard!
How dare you!
Indeed...
Yes, it may be true that I am lacking.
Ayame-sama.
So you will admit to it.
Then please hand over the master key.
We will be taking control of the Iron Fortress now.
Engineer!
Change course for the mountains.
The mountains are dangerous!
It's surrounded by high ground, and more vulnerable to Corpses attacks!
It's the faster way to Diamond Citadel.
So much for Corpseless ...
Some Corpseless I am...
In the end I'm just a Corpse!
You're hungry, aren't you?
I'm starving too.
Stop!
Takumi!
We dont want any Corpseless lovers!
Did you forget you got saved by these Corpseless s?
Why me too?
Hurry up and get inside now!
You've got to be kidding me.
Stay back, Takumi!
I might be a Corpse!
Seems like it.
I heard you attacked Ayame-sama.
You dog.
Pervert.
Why?!
Here, I brought you this.
You're not going to let them order you around, are you?
Takumi...
This is perfect.
We were just getting hungry.
Right, Ikoma?
Huh?
Hey!
Maybe I'll ask you.
Stop it!
I'm trying to give people the choice.
What was that?
It's from outside.
They're going to disconnect our car!
Hey, there's people here!
Shut up, traitor!
Anybody who sides with the Corpses aren't human!
They're all cowards.
Just as brother said.
Stop!
What was that?
It can't be!
Corpse s!
It's the Corpses!
Oh, my God!
Open this door!
It's a Bizarro.
What?
It's learned how to fight from experience
They're formidable.
Move.
Damn it, this won't work.
It's the Corpses!
Save us!
Help-
It's the Corpses!
Corpses are inside!
Co -
The seventh car and back have been taken over!
The Corpses have invaded the train cars?!
Isn't there some way to disconnect the cars without the master key?
You're not going to save them?!
Sometimes it's necessary to simply minimize casualties!
Leave it to me.
We will take care of this.
No, I will go as well.
We are heading to the rear cars.
I ask those who are able to follow me!
Send everyone without weapons to the front!
We need to stop the Corpses!
Let's go, Nameless.
We'll exit from the service hatch and go after it.
You want to go outside?
It's our only option.
We are... stopping the Bizarro ourselves!
Fire!
Kurusu, go get your sword!
What?
You saw how the Corpseless fought.
Close combat is possible.
As long as you're a trained Knight!
Hold your position!
Well, I said that...
Damn it.
We'll go as soon as we clear the tunnel!
You wouldn't do that.
We'll be passing in and out of tunnels for a while.
Unless you actually want to get your head lopped off.
I can't quit now!
If I could at least know when we'd clear a tunnel.
The entrance said Yodose Cavern, didn't it?
You could read that?
At this speed?
Then maybe we're lucky.
There'll be a break in tunnels after three more.
That'll be when we strike.
Kuranosuke!
Ayame-sama.
I am a Warrior as well!
No way...
There's no end.
Ayame-sama, please stay back.
Kurusu...
We'll be able to go after this one!
We take out the Corpses on top before we reach the next tunnel...
Thats right!
Ikoma.
I might be... coming to my limit sooner than I thought.
If that's the case, you'll be on your own.
Can you do it?
What other choice do I have?!
I figured you'd say that.
Nameless -chan!
I'm sorry.
Um...
I know they may have said some awful things to you...
Hey, I need someone around to keep this Iron Fortress moving, after all.
We're through!
Let's go.
Don't order me around.
Ikoma!
You can do it!
We're almost there!
You're way slower than Nameless!
What are you spacing out for?!
Pay attention!
All right, we've cleared the top.
Nameless?
Kurusu!
Who... is this?!
How is this possible?
The Corpse knows sword fighting?!
Kurusu!
Back me up!
Kurusu, hang in there!
Hurry, he needs to be treated!
Ikoma...
You have to take down the Bizarro.
Okay.
Don't get thrown off.
I'm counting on you.
If you're a dead meat... by the time I wake up...
Ikoma!
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
She's only sleeping!
Take care of her!
Okay!
Me too...?
Jiro!
I will... save them!
More! Send more shields!
Purification!
I will... protect them!
I will... defeat him!
I don't care who...
And I'll take him down!
Corpseless?
I see.
If we had his gun...
You saw it pierce through the Corpse's heart, didn't you?
A-Ayame-sama!
Ikoma!
This is a contract!
In exchange for my blood...
You're not getting past!
Hurry up!
Your motions are too big.
You've got a lot to learn!
Ikoma did it!
Purification!
Purification!
Victory!
Purification! Purification!
Purification! Purification! Purification! Purification!
Damn it.
We will have the two Corpseless s ride with us on the Iron Fortress.
But... the Corpseless s crave blood.
What are you going to?
I shall offer them my own blood.
I am opposed to this.
You will not be able to provide enough blood to the two of them on your own.
She won't be alone.
Please use my blood as well.
You won't mind if the blood comes from a guy, right?
It's true that they are good to have on our side.
Thank you, everyone.
Perhaps the souls of those we couldn't save...
If they do...
That I promise to live for her too.
And even if she feels a little lonely...
Are you human or a Corpse?!
I'm neither!
I'm a Corpseless!
I will remember that day
Losing myself
In steam
Countless mistakes are made
When I can't see anything ahead
You said
Ask your own burning blood
Answer my beat
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress
Stand up
And slam everything onto the ground
My soul is devoted to my friend
Burn your life
Change the world
Fitting in with the crowd
Like a puzzle piece
Is a lie without a shadow
Forgotten glory
Irritation is filled
In a box
Waiting to start
Delusional goal
Don't be above your daydream
Smooth vision
If your dream loses its way
I will sing I will build a bridge
To sound the silence
Rhythm continues, forever to stay on one side
Passed townscape goes far away with ending love
To undelivered torn image
Resistance is awakened Disqualified impulse
Chapter Four
Flowing Blood
