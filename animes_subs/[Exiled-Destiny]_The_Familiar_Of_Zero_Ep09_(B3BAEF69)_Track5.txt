I don't want you to go!
I'm just going to do laundry.
You're lying! You're going to sneak off and go see another girl.
I won't see anyone, okay? I'll be right back!
Really?
Really.
Really, for real?
Really, for real, really!
So you behave, okay?
Yeah. I'll be lonely, but I'll be waiting.
Then...
Saito...
Hurry back.
Louise...
A history of the couple's romance that starts from the first kiss
You, the one who cast magic on this destiny, suddenly appeared
The sky where two moons never fade away
That's an impossibility, right?
This is the first time I've felt anything like this
I'm feeling more and more at ease with this place
Even if you trip and become depressed
I will always hold you tight with a squeeze
The story where we met that day stays hot with a sweet kiss
See, you can cast magic, and the wishes will surely come true
A history of the couple's romance that starts from the first kiss
You, the one who cast magic on this destiny, suddenly appeared
Louise's Change of Heart
A love potion?!
It was a slight error that Louise drank it.
You must have been there when the effects kicked in.
Montmorency!
Can it be that you were trying to make me drink it?!
Oh, how touching!
To think you would go that far to capture my feelings.
It doesn't have to be you in particular.
Seeing someone is nothing but a way to pass time.
I just don't like being cheated on!
There is no way that I would cheat.
I am an eternal servant of love.
Save that for later!
You have no eye for the mood.
Hey, Mon-Mon!
My name is Montmorency!
Hurry up and get Louise back to normal!
The effects will wear off in due time.
When is that?
Maybe a month from now,
or a year from now.
Wait a minute, you were planning on making me...
You've got to be kidding!
Good morning.
Oh, Siesta...
You really were waiting for another girl!
What are you talking about?
No matter how you look at it, she was just passing by!
I love you so much, yet you...
Saito, you idiot, idiot!
Come on!
Don't cry...
Oh, um, this isn't what it seems to be. There's a bit of a reason...
What isn't what it seems to be?
Saito, don't you love me?
No, nobody said such a thing...
My, aren't you popular?
Siesta, I'm telling you, listen to me!
Hey, Siesta!
You really love that woman after all, don't you?
That's not it!
Saito, you idiot!
Sheesh!
Here we go.
You know, about earlier...
It's all right.
I don't mind at all.
Besides, there was nothing there to begin with.
In any case, just listen to me.
That's all because of a love potion.
Love potion?
Yeah, apparently she mistakenly ingested one somehow last night,
and she's been like that ever since.
You don't have to tell such a lie. I really don't mind.
A lie? It's not a lie...
Even peasants like me know.
Drugs to alter people's emotions are banned by law.
What was that?!
I'm sorry, but I'm busy now.
Hey, wait, Siesta!
So that's what it was.
Damn that Mon-Mon...
Louise must be mad.
What are you doing?
At least put on a pair of panties!
I won't put one on!
Why not?
Um... if you'd like, you can tell me why...
Because I have no sex appeal.
I know that because I was told so many times the other day.
The other day?
Oh, at the Fairy Cafe...
That's why you keep going to other girls, Saito.
That's why you won't do anything to me
even though we're always in the same room.
Anything?
Does that mean I can do something?
That's off limits!
Of course...
But if it's a little bit, I'd look the other way.
If it was for like an hour,
I'd close my eyes and pretend I didn't know about it.
You say that, but...
Anyway...
Please, put something on, okay?
I was lonely for all this time!
You idiot!
Look, you're acting strange because of a love potion.
That's not true. It's not because of a love potion!
When I look at you, Saito,
my heart gets all painful, and it starts to race...
Saito!
Ouch...
Dammit!
What's wrong?
Don't make faces like that!
You wait here. I'll make sure to turn you back to normal.
Isn't it all right?
I think it's a bit better for her to be smitten over you
than to be scolding you left and right like before.
Shut up!
I don't need the power of a love potion.
Am I not always at your side like this?
Isn't it just that there's no other girls to woo because of summer vacation?
That's not...
Hey, Mon-Mon!
Why don't you knock?!
You still have no manners at all.
Shut up!
Get Louise back to normal, right now!
Didn't I tell you before?
Until the effects wear off...
There's some potion or a way to undo the magic, isn't there?
It's not that there isn't one,
but you can't do it here.
I don't have the potion necessary to do it with.
And where is that?
Saito... Is that how you treat nobility?
Want to have another duel, Guiche?
Well, not really.
It's useless to speak of nobility and peasants with you, anyway.
Montmorency, for now, I think it's best if we listened to his orders.
You're so pathetic.
You say that, but even getting a Spirit Tear is really difficult!
Would you like to eat stale bread, Mon-Mon?
I heard somewhere that making love potions is illegal...
That's...
I guess I'll have to inform the principal about this.
Oh, all right! I guess I have no choice!
I'll go there and get it myself soon!
Go get such a rare potion?
I know where it is.
Though whether I can get it by going there is another matter.
All right, let's go tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Come to think of it, I think I saw Mr. Colbert in the lab earlier.
I'll go! You want me to go, don't you?
So where is that location?
Lake Lagdorian.
Water-based mages bind a pact with the spirit there.
Though I've only been there once, as a small child.
You just have to sleep together with me!
If you don't, I'll punish you!
All right, I get it, now sleep!
We're getting up early tomorrow.
Yeah...
I've seen this often enough...
Argh, I can't sleep at all now!
Along the border with Galia?
It'll take half the day to get there.
I didn't ask you to come with me, did I?
What would your knight be doing
if he didn't go with you at a time like this?
So sleepy...
Is she really going to be back to normal?
Lake Lagdorian is up ahead, past this hill.
So we finally get to see Lake Lagdorian, our destination.
He really is carefree. What part of him is a knight?
You know, I knitted this for you yesterday, Saito.
I see... It's a lovely hat.
It's not a hat! It's a sweater!
Oh, I see! You're right... It's a lovely jellyfish sweater!
Do you like it?
Yeah...
Help me!
What's this? Water up to here?
Is the Water Spirit or whatever really here?
It looks like the Water Spirit is upset.
Upset?
The water level is unusually high.
Unusually?
Look.
They're all underwater.
When I came here with my father as a child, it wasn't like this.
Let's wait a little while.
The spirit won't come out until after the sun sets.
Don't just sit there chatting idly! Before all that, save me...
All right, Robin... I want to contact one of my old friends.
Now, this should identify me.
Tell the old Water Spirit that
someone who bid a contract with it would like to talk to it.
If she can find it, Robin will bring it to us.
Will it come?
Who knows...
And the actual person involved is asleep.
In the past, I came here with my father,
and bid a contract with the spirit.
If the spirit remembers, I'm sure it will come.
And after that, we collect a tear...
Do we have to tell sad stories or something?
Idiot. It's just called a Tear.
We have to have it split off a tiny portion of its body!
Listen, okay?
If you make the spirit upset, we can forget the Tear,
and our lives will be in danger too!
You really have to be careful!
Gotcha.
It's here!
This is the Water Spirit...
Hey, this takes me back.
I am Montmorency Margarita la Fere de Montmorency...
A water user, of a family that has had a lasting pact with you.
If you remember anything about my blood,
please answer me in a way that we can recognize!
I remember, lonely one.
I remember the fluid that runs in your body.
It spoke!
I'm glad. O Water Spirit, I have a favor to ask.
A favor?
I would like to have a small piece of you.
We decline, lonely one.
Don't say that! Please, Water Spirit!
Wait! Knock it off!
If she gets in a bad mood...
I'll do whatever you tell me to, so just a bit...
A tiny bit...
Very well.
You would do anything, say you?
Yeah...
We are occupied with increasing the water,
and have no time to drive off attackers.
Attackers?
Some of your kind are attacking us.
We desire to be rid of them.
Attacking the Water Spirit? Who'd do such a fearless thing?
There's no way I'd know that!
All right.
If we defeat them, you'll give us a piece of your body, right?
We shall bestow it.
I don't want to be involved in a fight!
You want to be locked up, Mon-Mon?
All right! Do as you like!
Attacking the spirit that is at the bottom of the lake...
That's quite a mage we're up against.
How do you dive into the lake?
Most likely a user of air.
I think so too.
Using air magic, you can create a sphere of air
and use it to walk along the lake bottom.
I think we're up against quite a caster.
Is that so?
You're talking only to Montmorency!
You love her much more than you love me, don't you?!
That's not it! We're talking about something important,
on how to turn you back to normal!
Turning what part of me back to normal?
I'm totally normal right now.
I just love you, Saito!
I understand!
I love you too, Louise, so can you be quiet for a little while?
Yeah! I'll stay quiet.
For that to happen to Louise...
It really works well.
Don't think it's someone else's problem!
Someone's here!
It sounds like a spell is being cast.
Well, there's no doubt about it.
Be a good girl and stay here for a while.
Saito!
Montmorency...
As long as I am with you, I won't let you face any danger...
It's all right! You hurry up and go too! Hurry up and stop them!
Yeah... I guess so.
Hold on.
The opponent is a user of pretty powerful magic spells.
There's no way we would win going head-to-head against them.
You're going to help me?
Of course.
A noble would be shamed if he made a peasant fight all by himself.
Sorry!
Guiche, I had totally lost my faith in you until now.
Don't worry about it.
So, what do we do?
The plan is like this...
I'll use magic here to draw their attention.
Use that to surprise them with an ambush!
Understood!
Wait... Are you trying to swing by with the easy part?
What are you talking about?
I am a mage, and you are a swordsman, aren't you?
Considering our tactics...
Yeah, yeah...
Then I'll run by behind them, so I'm leaving the rest to you.
Yeah...
I came here thinking it would be a little vacation.
Why do I have to be in such a situation?
Earth, robust mother, answer my wishes and become a moving wall!
Huh?
They're taking turns using their magic, so they're never off guard!
Draw me, partner!
Now!
Hot!
Look out!
Not good! Saito, run!
Don't be mean to Saito!
Saito?
Did someone say Saito?
Oh, it's true.
Looking closely, it really is Saito.
Huh?
Guiche, Montmorency... Even Louise?
Why are you all here?
I see, so that's what's going on.
But why did you make such a dangerous thing as a love potion?
That's because...
Ouch!
I just wanted to make some.
That puts us in trouble.
We have to defeat the Water Spirit for Tabitha to keep face.
Why do you have to defeat it?
That's because...
Tabitha's family asked her to.
The water level is rising every day,
and their territory is getting damaged.
You have your own reasons for being here... This is tough.
Hey, Mon-Mon, you were saying that the Water Spirit was angry, right?
I did, but why?
For now, we can ask it the reason why it's so upset.
Why are you overflowing the lake with water?
It's causing everyone trouble.
Because one of your folk abducted the treasure that we were guarding.
A treasure?
We can exist only in water.
Therefore, should we fill this entire world with water,
we will someday have the treasure back in our hands.
Fill the world with water? That's a long-term plan...
That can't be helped.
Spirits are immortal,
so their sense of time is different from ours.
All right, if that's the case,
I'll bring whatever that treasure is back to you!
Saito, it's easy to say that, but...
What's the name of that treasure?
Andvari's Ring. A ring that has spent much time with us.
Andvari... I've heard of it.
I think it was a magic item that grants artificial souls.
What kind of person stole it?
One of the individuals was called Cromwell.
We know nothing else.
Cromwell, is it?
Okay, all right.
I'll make sure to find that guy and bring the ring back!
I promise!
You should give up.
Who would believe the promise of someone who randomly showed up,
let alone someone like you, who isn't even a mage?
We believe.
The Spirit Tear!
Why?!
Gundolf kept oath with us in the distant past.
If it is Gundolf, it is worth believing.
Gundolf?
What's that?
That again?
Well, in any case, I will make sure to keep the promise someday.
Someday?
Spirits don't die, right?
Then no matter how many years it takes, it doesn't matter.
So can you put all the overflowing water back to normal?
We shall so promise.
Owe you...
Saito...
How horrible!
The biggest embarrassment of my life, no, the biggest mistake of my life!
I thought you'd forget everything when you returned to normal!
I remember all of it!
To think! Me! To this dog!
Doing this and that!
Don't take it out on me!
It's Mon-Mon's fault for making the potion,
and yours for drinking it!
Be silent!
You dog!
Who is it?
You are as rowdy as ever.
Can it be...
Princess?
The time has come.
It is finally time to go through with it.
As you wish, Your Excellency,
Lord Cromwell.
As if I were under a real magic spell
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart
But each time I see you, I give you a pointy, cold shoulder
Why do I act mean towards the one that I think about the most?
My true feelings, the shards of loneliness
In the deepest part of my heart, I'm calling for you
For the day to start from zero
Princess, I will take the feelings you harbor,
and head to the kingdom of Albion.
The magic knight that will guard us...
Why is it you?
