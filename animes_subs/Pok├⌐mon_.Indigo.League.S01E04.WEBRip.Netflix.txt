That's right. I declare to the Pokemon of the world.
I will be the greatest Pokemon trainer,
the greatest Pokemon Master of all time!
As his adventures began, Ash, our hero from Pallet, chose Pikachu,
a Pokemon who wasnt too thrilled with its new trainer.
A flock of angry Spearows nearly finished them off,
but the injured Pikachu saved the day with its thunder shock power.
Pikachu, are you all right?
Pikachu regained its health at the Pokemon Center in Viridian City,
which soon found itself under attack.
What are, who are they?
They are Jessie and James of the notorious Team Rocket,
who, with Meowth, attacked the center, hoping to steal some rare Pokemon.
But their sinister plans were thwarted by Ash and Pikachu,
who next journeyed into the Viridian Forest,
where Ash made his first catch.
Yes! I did it! I got Caterpie!
Next, he caught Pidgeotto.
Yes! We got Pidgeotto!
And even more surprises were to come.
Caterpie, this is so great.
Caterpie evolved into Metapod.
And now Challenge of the Samurai.
-Whats wrong now? -I think I see another bug. Gross!
Maybe its a...
-Cow-terpie! -Ugh.
Thats not funny.
You know I hate bugs and I saw one right over there.
A Weedle!
Weedle, the stinger on this Pokemons head guarantees
that any attacker will get the point right where it hurts.
A stinger, huh? Now, theres a challenge.
Why are you so excited about a bug with a stinger? Make it go away!
You got to be kidding.
You cant possibly expect a great Pokemon trainer like me to let a Weedle escape.
Im going to catch it.
Oh! Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
You have to weaken a Pokemon before you can capture it.
-Lets go, Pikachu. -Pikachu.
Ah, taking a nap, huh?
Okay, snooze, you lose.
Theres still Pidgeotto and Metapod to do the job,
and they give me the respect I deserve.
You deserve to have your head examined.
-Dont just stand there! Catch it! -Have no fear. Ash is here.
Pidgeotto, I choose you!
-Pidgeotto, Gust Attack! -Pigeo!
Thats the way to do it!
This whole forest is crawling with slimy, disgusting Pokemon.
I wish theyd all just bug off.
-Hi-yah! -
Greetings, oh, shrieking maiden.
Are you by chance the Pokemon trainer who comes from Pallet?
No, thats not me.
Alas. My search continues.
I advise you to refrain from further shrieking
while passing through this forest,
unless your goal is to attract a horde of Beedrills.
What a weird kid.
I wonder why hed be looking for a Pokemon trainer from...
Ah, thats Ash!
Weedle!
Pidgeotto, watch out for its poison sting!
Ha, nice work.
Okay, here we go. Weedle, Ive got you now.
Greetings. Am I addressing the Pokemon trainer who comes from Pallet?
Im a Pokemon trainer from Pallet, but Im a little busy.
- I have found you at last. -Ash!
- -Hiyah!
That sword doesnt scare me. Theres no way youre stealing my Pokemon.
-I am no Pokemon thief. -Who are you then?
I am Samurai. I am also shrewd, fearless and completely invincible in combat.
I have been searching the forest for you.
-What do you want from me? -A Pokemon match.
Let us see who triumphs.
-Pika? - Oh, no!
I forgot about Weedle. Ill get it.
Poke Ball, go!
Pidgeo!
Pidgeotto, return!
That Weedle only got away because you mixed me up.
Dont blame your failure on me.
Your Pokemon handling is dim-witted and clumsy.
What do you know about Pokemon?
I bet could beat you in a Pokemon match blindfolded.
-There is one way to find out. -Pikachu.
Pidgeotto, do your stuff.
Uh-oh.
Ash, dont you know you have to let your Pokemon rest once in a while?
Well, I...
Only a novice goes into battle with a pooped-out Pokemon.
Your blunder will cost you dearly.
Pinsir, assume battle mode!
Whoa, hes got a Pinsir.
Pinsir, this fearsome Pokemon
uses its powerful claws to put the squeeze on its opponents.
That Pinsir looks pretty tough
-but Pidgeotto can beat it. -Pidgeo!
Pidgeotto, Sand Attack!
Thats childs play! Pinsir, tackle it!
Pidgeo...
-Your Pokemon is beaten. -Oh, no. Pidgeotto, return!
-Novice. Are you ready to surrender? -No way. Im just warming up.
Metapod, I choose you now!
Watch and weep as Pinsir crushes your Metapod in half.
-No. -
-Those claws! -Ash?
Call off Metapod. Not even a bug deserves this.
This match is already won.
Metapod, harden now!
-Pikachu! -It worked.
So now whos the novice?
Pinsir, return!
Clever, quite clever. Poke Ball, go!
Metapod?
Metapod, harden like his.
Maximum hardness, Metapod.
More power, Metapod. Samurais is weakening.
Harder, youre the stronger Metapod.
-Im tired. -James, stop whining.
But, Jessie, whats the point of dragging this tank around?
To protect us from Beedrills.
Ever been stung by one? It hurts.
Hey, down there, quit chattering. Get a move on.
-What are you doing up there? -Why dont you come help us?
-Wish I could but Im riding lookout. -Well, look out for this.
Ah! Hey, wait a second. Come back! Meowth!
A little more.
Metapod, full power.
We could be stuck in this forest for the rest of our lives.
Boys can be so stubborn.
Dont give up!
You two are more hardheaded than your Metapods.
- -Huh?
-Whats that noise? -A Beedrill swarm approaches.
Our match must end. Metapod, return!
Beedrill swarm.
Beedrill, this Pokemon is an evolved form of Weedle,
following its Kakuna stage. Its sting is highly poisonous.
The Weedle that got away from you has informed the rest of its kind.
Good day.
Metapod, return now!
Oh, no, it got away.
- -Pikachu!
Come on. Lets move it.
-But Metapod... -
Theyre gaining on us.
A whole hive of Kakunas.
Kakuna, a transitional stage between Weedle and Beedrill.
Kakunas remain inactive until they evolve into deadly Beedrills and hatch.
Hey, over there. Its Metapod!
Keep your voice down.
Beedrills, theyve evolved.
My cabin! I think we can make it!
Whew, that was close.
Ah, I hope youve learned your lesson, novice.
Your letting that Weedle escape almost cost our lives.
-Take back that novice crack. -I do take it back.
Because not even a novice would abandon his own Pokemon as you did.
I tried to save Metapod.
Chu.
Your Metapod will pay for its trainers inexperience.
The other trainers from Pallet would never have been so irresponsible.
Other trainers from Pallet?
Have you fought Pokemon matches against Gary and the others?
Ah. There were three spectacular matches, each more challenging than the last.
Those trainers really knew how to raise Pokemon.
Even though I was defeated all three times,
I was inspired to redouble my own training.
I have been eagerly preparing for that day
when finally I would beat the next Pokemon trainer from Pallet.
So thats why youve been waiting around here for Ash to show up.
Compared to those other three, novice here is a joke.
Metapod.
Meowth!
Do you know what Meowths favorite game is?
Ugh, get off!
Scratch and sniffle.
- - Guess who.
-Prepare for trouble. -Make it double.
-To protect the world from devastation. -To unite all peoples within our nation.
-To denounce the- -No, not again, not now!
Never interrupt the Team Rocket motto.
-But the Beedrill- - Ahem.
-To denounce the evils of truth and love. -To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie. -James.
Keep it down before you wake up the Beedrills.
Team Rocket! Blast off at the speed of light!
-Surrender now or prepare to fight! -Meowth! Thats right!
Little boy, why dont you give us your Pikachu?
Theres no use trying to resist us, so be smart and hand over the Pokemon.
I dont have Pikachu with me and even if I did, Id never let you take it.
Come back here.
If I make it past the Beedrills, maybe theyll dive-bomb Team Rocket.
The tank will surely come in handy now.
It was worth the struggle dragging it here.
-What? -Meowth! Theyre eating the tank!
Well, we made it from paper to reduce the weight.
- Who knew? - Numskulls!
So there you are.
-Here, into the Poke Ball, Metapod. -Metapod, Metapod.
Metapod?
Huh?
Lets go.
I didnt abandon you, Metapod. I just got sidetracked.
It was all Samuras fault. Argh!
No, it wasnt Samurais fault.
It was my fault.
If I was a better Pokemon trainer, Id stop making all these excuses.
From now on, I swear Ill never run away and leave my friends behind again.
No more excuses.
Oh!
-Ash! -Watch out for the twineedle attack!
Pikachu!
Metapod!
Are you hurt? Are you okay, Metapod?
- -Pika, pika.
Butterfree.
-Oh, its so beautiful. -Pika.
Butterfree, one week after Caterpie evolves into Metapod,
it again evolves into Butterfree.
Here come the other Beedrills.
-Butterfree. -
Yeah. Okay!
Butterfree, knock them out with your Sleep Powder!
Yay! You put all of them to sleep!
Butterfree, youre the best! Heh, hooray!
You were able to handle your Butterfree so well just after it evolved.
-Most impressive. -Pikachu.
This trail will lead you to Pewter City.
Thats great. But before we leave you, Samurai,
we still have to finish our match.
Compared with you, my friend, I am the novice.
But I will keep perfecting my technique and one day, we will meet again.
Im sure it will be a most spectacular match.
That is guaranteed.
Just promise not to match Metapod versus Metapod again.
Pikachu.
Until then, Samurai.
-See you! -Pikachu.
Farewell.
With Team Rocket thwarted for now,
Ash and his friends leave the Viridian Forest
and set their sights on Pewter City.
Do you have any more bright ideas?
Well, unlike you, at least I have ideas.
-Yeah, and theyre all bad. -Who asked you?
- Uh-oh! - Oh, no!
Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow!
-J Pokemon! J Attention all Pokemon trainers!
Do you got what it takes to be the best?
Today well do 30 Pokemon!
