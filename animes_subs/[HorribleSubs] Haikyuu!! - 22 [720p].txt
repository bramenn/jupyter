What are you thinking?!
You won't get your way!
Hinata, you're running too far away!
Shoyo, I don't think that's a scheming face...
I think he's actually smiling, maybe...
Don't say maybe, Nishinoya!
Hinata, I'll kill you!
Kageyama's actually trying to smile...
Use the signs I told you about. We're changing our plan.
Thanks!
Did Sugawara-san tell you about the signs?
I heard it in between sets.
All right!
Let's keep it going!
Heck yeah!
Go, go, go! Go, go, Seijoh!
Episode 22: Evolution
Don't look so amazed. I was pretty nervous.
Really?
Of course, there were third-years that played at last year's Inter-High,
so I wasn't able to play in a lot of official matches.
I hate to say it,
but it's likely that Kageyama's had his feet on the court more than I have.
Despite that, Kageyama was freaking out quite a bit.
Speaking of, the King's going right into a serve.
Do you think he'll be all right?
Kageyama, nice serve!
Nice serve! One point!
Kageyama looks pretty happy.
Yeah.
It sort of puts me at ease.
What does?
Apparently every player feels the same pride about the fact
that they're going to be on the court.
No matter whether they're some genius or just a regular guy.
Kageyama-kun, relax!
Oh. Apparently, he's fine.
We're ending this the first time!
Yeah!
Watari!
Service ace!
He even got it from the libero!
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
And now they're tied.
Yes!
I'm sorry!
It's all right! We'll get the next one!
Yeah!
Yeah!
He's asking for a high five, you idiot!
Yeah!
Yeah...
Kageyama just gave someone a high five.
Yeah...
Sorry! Cover!
Right!
They broke it! It's coming back!
Chance ball!
Bring it...
Which will it be?
They didn't say anything?!
There it is!
That quick is so insane!
All right! Now Karasuno's turning things around!
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
Sugawara-san compliments me a lot if I make it!
Hey, Hinata.
Well done...
Are you my boss?
Hinata's so sharp! Damn!
And Kageyama's playing like a fish in water.
Kageyama...
(Tobiuo = flying fish)
Damn it.
All right, calm down.
There's no need for us to panic and break down for them.
We just have to get one back, and we'll be fine.
Right!
Hey, that facial expression and pose piss me off, so stop.
So rude!
Iwaizumi-san, nice receive!
Kageyama has apparently regained his usual rhythm.
I'm sorry...
Don't mind!
No, that's not all...
He was only concerned about the opponent's block.
I should have made it go towards the side a little.
Don't worry. They were all good serves.
Now, just slightly, his concern is for his teammates as well.
Thank you.
All right... Don't hold back.
If we don't get this set, it's hopeless.
Make sure you use that freak quick as much as possible!
Kunimi, nice serve!
All right!
Nice receive!
Kageyama told Hinata that if he's around, Hinata would be the best...
But even with you...
You, with Hinata's attacks...
You're the best.
All right! They broke 20 points first!
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
Now it's the final scene...
That hurt, you idiot!
All right, we're in the 20's.
I'm driving some spirit into you!
I guess our issue might be over there.
Why did it turn into Tsukishima versus Kageyama?!
One more!
Hinata, nice serve!
Net in!
Chance ball!
Mattsun, nice cover!
Kageyama!
All right!
How would you like the toss?
A bit higher would be great.
Got it!
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
All right!
I guess even Seijoh would call a time-out after that.
When 10 falls back and when 11 moves up,
the number of times Karasuno uses the center decreases, doesn't it?
Yeah. Simply put, I think that Tobio doesn't get along with the giant.
In yesterday's match,
as well as today's, they don't seem to be communicating very well.
I think that out of all of Karasuno's spikers,
Tobio has the hardest time accommodating that giant.
I really don't want to be friends with you.
Why?!
You seem like you'd use our weaknesses against us.
Why would I use my teammates' weaknesses against them?!
I think that Sugawara-san makes sure to pay attention to all of
Tsukishima, I think you're jumping too soon for the block.
Hold back a little.
the spikers' expressions as well as how they're doing that day.
Understood.
Yamaguchi, make sure you clearly call everything.
Right.
What?
He may have asked me to read his expression,
but I don't see anything other than a face pisses me off.
Kageyama.
First, you need to have a conversation. Talk.
Especially with Tsukishima, communication is key.
Right...
Got it!
He picked it up! Here comes the counter!
Nice receive!
Left!
Tsukishima's not hitting it with all he's got.
They caught up!
Damn, they're tied now.
A break!
Yeah, totally.
Sensei.
Right.
All right!
Maybe they lack attack power, after all.
Karasuno not having 10 here would be rough.
Come on, your faces! They're all tense!
Calm down and go! Your moves are great!
Yeah.
Hey.
How was that toss, damn it?
Why are you talking like Tanaka-san?
What was that, damn it?
It's like you're saying, Shut up, and hit this toss, you commoner, and it pisses me off.
What?!
Dang it, Tsukishima...
You sound like a kid. Stop picking fights!
What do you mean by that?
I have my own way of doing things,
so I'd rather you keep your tosses consistent.
Um, what does that mean?
I'm assuming that when Kageyama sets an A-quick to Tsukishima,
the course it should go in is being determined by the toss.
Cross
If the ball is about a ball's width away and center, it's a cross,
and if it's further, it's a turn.
Turn
Kageyama is, of course, setting it where he thinks it'll succeed the best,
but I think Tsukshima is having a hard time hitting those.
You're not the only one thinking.
The shape of the opponent's defense.
The best attacks I've been doing today.
We're all thinking about that.
Even Hinata has started thinking enough to use normal quicks now, right?
Though just barely.
What'd you mean by that?! What do you mean, just barely?!
Now, now...
All right.
You're rather agreeable today.
You feeling okay?
We're just going to have to try and find out.
Tsukishima's probably not used to people who face him head on,
We're taking this set, no matter what!
and he can't run from that.
Right!
Nice, Noya-san!
I have my own way of doing things,
so I'd like you to keep your tosses consistent.
A feint!
Yeah! He got over the block!
He totally did it!
How annoying!
I thought that he was going to hit it hard up until the end.
Nice! Tsukishima's lively after getting through the opponent's guard.
Lively?
It's hard to see, but that expression he has means he's pretty into it.
Oh.
Chance ball!
Another feint!
Nice, Watari.
It's coming back!
Chance ball!
11's pretty good.
But Seijoh's block is pretty high, so I think they're avoiding a straight-on attack.
With a feint, you can sort of run away.
Looks like 11 is running away from the blocks after all.
All right!
Nice, Mattsun.
Damn it. They're taking back one point after another.
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
Center, 11!
Again? All right! This time I'll get it!
Nice receive, Watari!
All right!
Center!
Tanaka, nice receive!
Damn it!
Be careful!
Sorry, it's a bit short! Cover!
They really need to get this.
Will it go to the ace after all?
We're all thinking about that.
11 again!
No! Don't go out too far!
All right!
You piss me off, you know that?
They're being too cautious about the feints,
so our defense is being concentrated up front.
I'm sorry!
They got us.
It's all right. Next time!
Kn-Knife... Nuff... Nice.
Don't mess up that line, Kageyama!
Wow. Kageyama complimented Tsukishima.
Kageyama is definitely changing, as well.
How much do you suck at compliments?!
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
Karasuno's at set point.
Seriously?!
Just one more point!
Just one more point!
We won't let you have it!
Go, go, go, Hajime!
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
Push it, push it, Hajime! One more!
It'll be fine!
One point!
If we can get this one point, like we usually do, this set will be ours!
Congratulations.
Best Setter Award Oikawa Toru
The third year of junior high,
our last tournament...
That's a rare smile, with no ulterior motive.
My smile is always straightforward and pure.
Straightforward and pure coming from you is already impure.
Of course I'm happy! It's the first time I've received this.
Oikawa Toru, overall, is a pretty silly guy,
but there was a time that he wasn't smiling.
He had a more athletic build than others.
He was also blessed with natural ability.
Especially when he began junior high,
the way he matured was way ahead of the flock.
Miyagi Prefecture Junior High Newcomer Volleyball Tournament
Even then, there were walls that he could not climb.
Thanks to the Young Giant Ushiwaka, Shiratorizawa Academy Junior High
was eventually known as the best in the prefecture.
Why can't we win?!
When we fought them, we lost.
We couldn't even get one set.
We tried to go higher, to a higher stage,
but we were thwarted until our third year in junior high.
Then...
My name is Kageyama Tobio and I came from Akiyama Elementary School.
I've been playing volleyball since the second grade.
It's a pleasure to be working with you!
A genius appeared at his back,
and his talent shone with astonishing brightness.
More than anything, it appeared that he was very happy to be touching the ball.
Plus, the way he was able to handle the ball was on a totally different level than others.
We'll have him play the basic positions, but he'll be a setter some day.
Indeed.
After that, Oikawa ended up practicing even harder.
You're overworking yourself!
The coach just warned you about that yesterday!
If you get hurt, everything will be pointless, you dumbass!
Come on, you're done. Stretch!
He seemed to be panicking.
That panic surfaced in a practice match in the form of an
unbelieveable amount of combo misses.
And then...
Kageyama, give it a shot.
Yes, sir.
Okay!
Front! Front!
Got it.
Nice cover!
Nice key!
Nice serve!
Oikawa-san.
Please show me how to serve.
Get away.
Get away.
Get away.
Don't come over here!
Calm down, you dumbass!
Sorry...
Kageyama, I'm sorry, but we're done for today.
Oh, okay...
The change-up today was to cool your head.
You need to have some more composure!
Right now, I can't win against Shiratorizawa,
so there's no way I can have composure!
I want to win and go to nationals.
To win, I need to...
I this, I that. It's annoying!
Do you think you're fighting by yourself?!
You've got to be kidding, you dumbass!
If you think how you're doing equals how the team will do, I'll punch you!
You already did!
There's no one on our team who can beat Ushiwaka one-on-one!
However...
There are six players on a volleyball court!
Even if our opponent's some genius first-year, or Ushiwaka,
the team with the better six is stronger, you dumbass!
The team with the better six is stronger.
Sorry, did I headbutt you too hard?
Well, how do I put this?
I suddenly feel invincible.
More importanty, Iwa-chan, is dumbass the only insult you've got?
Want me to make your nose bleed from the right side, too?
Nice course!
One more!
I don't know how to put it, but it looks like Oikawa's gotten over it.
Yes.
Oikawa-san, please show me the basics of a serve toss.
Heck no, you idiot! Idiot!
Oikawa! Stop picking fights with the first-years!
Our last tournament in junior high...
Kitagawa-Daiichi Shiratorizawa
We fought against Shiratorizawa Junior High,
and were able to get our first set.
We ended up in second place behind Shiratorizawa.
Best Setter Award Oikawa Toru
Oikawa was given the Best Setter Award.
This award is proof that our spikers gave it all they had.
Does that mean Ushiwaka's even higher?
Once we get into high school,
that's when...
we'll show Shiratorizawa who's boss!
Naturally.
And Tobio-chan,
I don't know where you'll be headed after this,
but I'm gonna crush you, so you better be prepared.
Blow your nose before saying your line!
Would you like a tissue?
Shut up!
Go, go, go! Go, go, Seijoh!
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
Bring it!
Push it, push it, push it! Push it, Seijoh!
Nice serve!
Nice serve!
Now we have Oikawa-kun serving...
The second opponent you want to show who's boss is right in front of you...
You can give it all you've got.
I know.
Go!
Nishinoya!
It went up!
Yeah! But it's going to go right back to Seijoh's side.
If they miss a serve here, they'd be losing this set, and yet he served like that...
He's amazing!
Chance ball!
The receive went perfectly back to the setter.
The highest probability is that they'll use a quick attack from the center.
It probably is. I know that's what I'd do...
But in this stage where they're being pushed into a corner, Oikawa-san...
will set it to Iwaizumi-san!
All right!
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
Seriously?
Karasuno got the set back.
Damn it! I'm sorry!
Don't mind!
Why are you laughing? I'll punch you!
Stop saying you'll hit me all the time, Iwa-chan.
Don't worry. I'd only say that to you, and I won't hit you.
Right then, doing a quick attack from the center would have been the cliche move.
What?
But apparently Tobio was able to read that I'd send to the left.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Do you understand what this means?
It means it's come down to not only methodical thinking,
but, in the end, our effort, as well.
My perfect trust with you, Iwa-chan.
Like I'd ever want that with you.
That just means they were making rather comprehensive decisions.
What did Mr. Refreshing
tell Tobio?
The dictator king is somehow trying to become a decent king.
What is this?
I'm really pissed off, and yet...
Hurry! Let's hurry up and finish
the final set!
Next Episode Preview
We've gotten to the final set.
Man, I got way too worked up, even though it's out of character.
That's rare.
Though my selling point is the fact that I'm a cute beauty.
Make volleyball your selling point!
