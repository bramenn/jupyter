Okay, the storyboard's good.
Thank you.
Looks like you'll be able to wrap up PCP's elementary school arc in the next two issues.
Yes.
Can you handle it, though?
It's only temporary, but you'll have the weekly PCP, the PCP for Hisshou,
and a third work, Reversi, all going on at the same time.
Yes.
Reversi's storyboard is done,
and I have a week between the final weekly PCP and the first Reversi. That's a lot of time.
Yeah.
When I wrote down a schedule for working on them together in the future,
I noticed that Reversi will have four chapters of 19 pages each, or 76 pages in total.
Monthly, PCP will have 45 pages.
That'll amount to 121 pages a month, or 30 pages a week.
We'll make it.
Won't that be pretty rough?
It'll be all right.
Ogawa's coming, too.
We'll do just fine if I don't take any time off.
Mashiro, don't push yourself
I know.
Shuujin, from now on you're going to be doing more pages too,
so keep up the quality of your scripts, okay?
Y-Yeah.
Moriya, hang on to it!
I'm not cut out for manual labor.
Mashiro, shall I place the toner over here?
Yes, please do.
When you have four desks, this is the best way to arrange them.
Yeah!
All we did was rearrange things, but it feels like a whole new room.
I wanted to maximize the limited space we have here.
I call dibs on the desk nearest to Mashiro!
That's not fair, Orihara!
I called it first!
In that case, I'll be taking this one, I guess.
Who the heck is this guy?
He just barged in here in and took over.
I know he's been an assistant here before, but...
We've been here longer than him.
Mashiro.
Yes?
If you've drawn up a schedule already, could you please show it to me?
Okay.
It'll be something like this.
It looks pretty taxing.
I think I can manage it somehow.
Oh, I meant for the assistants.
You're right.
So far, I've always had them come in on Tuesday, and we usually finish by Thursday.
But from now on, I might need them full time until Friday.
Friday's not very good for me...
I'm completely okay with that!
Me too.
This job was originally supposed to take until Friday anyway.
Thanks a lot.
And also, until I finish Reversi's first chapter,
I was hoping some of you could work on Saturdays, too.
You should have said that beforehand.
I have plans...
I-I'm sorry!
I'll be here on Saturdays!
Even though I'm working on my own manga.
Me too!
Same here!
Really?!
That'd be a great help!
In that case, we should be able to manage it.
Um, who's the chief around here?
Chief?
Uh, we don't really have one.
If you're going to work on two manga without selecting a chief to manage things,
you won't be able to control the workflow.
Then, Ogawa, will you be the chief?
Please do it, Ogawa!
Please!
Very well. I'll accept the responsibility.
Thank you.
We're counting on you, Ogawa!
Our efficiency has really shot through the roof since you came, Ogawa!
And our overall quality has increased as well.
Especially our backgrounds.
Ogawa, please keep teaching me more things.
Me too!
When I have spare time.
Please!
Mashiro?
Yes?
You're lagging behind a bit.
I'm sorry.
Since PCP's jumped to a middle school setting now,
I've gotten caught up in redrawing all the scenery and characters.
We have a chief now, so we can make up for lost time!
That's right!
Minor delays are popping up here and there,
but Reversi got more votes than Zombie Gun as a one-shot!
I don't want to lose to him in our serialized chapters either!
Things aren't looking good at this rate.
You need to have 26 pages of PCP ready in three days for Hisshou.
And three days after that,
we'll need 41 more pages to meet the deadline for Reversi's first chapter.
That's 67 pages in one week!
Y-You're that behind?
Why didn't you tell me, Saikou?
I know we're behind.
But there's no point in calculating how much is left.
I just have to keep drawing!
I'll definitely make it. I won't let the quality drop either.
If I don't sleep from now until then, I can get it done!
No sleep... until Monday?!
You can't do that! That's six days without sleep!
It's fine.
The color page is done.
And I've gotten used to drawing the separate styles of PCP and Reversi.
Gotten used to it?
Even if Mashiro does finish inking,
we still don't have nearly enough assistants.
Starting on Friday, when I can't come in to work...
Mashiro, it's getting late.
Oh. The trains are about to stop, so that'll be all for today.
I'll try to get as much done as I can tonight.
I see.
Everyone, let's go.
I'll stay until the first train.
No... Until I've caught up on finishing the manuscripts that Mashiro has inked already.
Me too.
If Mashiro isn't going to stop...
Then, I'll come as early as I can tomorrow.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Yes.
Good night!
Yes, I'm coming home now. See you soon.
Good morn
Everyone!
Have you all been working through the night?
Yes...
I bought energy drinks! Who wants one?!
Guys! My wife and I will apply blacks, whites, and tones.
If you need any, give us the pages!
Thank you.
I knew it.
He's still drawing PCP
even though the deadline is tomorrow!
Mashiro, at this rate, you won't finish Reversi!
I will!
I understand.
We can handle the backgrounds and minor characters,
so you just concentrate on inking in the main characters.
Everyone, if you have a panel with backgrounds, cut it out and give it to me!
Give the ones with background characters to Orihara.
Do the same with each page... No, with each panel.
Right, got it.
I'll be going now.
You should all go home and rest.
I'm going to stay here until it's done. Going home and coming back would just waste time.
Same here.
But then, we'll be less efficient...
Efficiency doesn't mean anything anymore.
We're finishing pages as soon as Mashiro's done with them,
but they're still slowly piling up.
Mashiro, even if you finish PCP on time tomorrow,
you can't possibly finish Reversi in three days
Actually, never mind.
Good luck.
Chief, you think we won't be able to pull this off.
Am I right?
Then why are you the only one going home?!
Moriya, this is all my fault for being late with the manuscript.
If you're upset, then bring it up with me.
I-I'm sorry.
Isn't Ogawa being a little unfair to the rest of us?
Just because he has two jobs...
No, that's what it means to be a professional assistant.
If he pulled an all-nighter here, he'd be inconveniencing another manga artist.
You're right.
But it still hurts to have someone as capable as Ogawa leave.
He does do his work well, and can get twice as much done as any of us.
However...
Who could that be this late at night?
This won't work.
Even if I manage to finish inking by tomorrow afternoon,
I don't have enough assistants to finish in time.
Mashiro!
I found two more people to help you out during the evenings.
I'm Okina. Nice to meet you.
I'm Miyagawa.
I'll do whatever you need, as long as you pay me the assistant's wage, that is.
Ogawa!
I've been trying to get together a few of my more skilled colleagues since yesterday, and I finally found some.
As the chief, I have a responsibility to get these manuscripts done.
Um, we're out of desks here. Guess I'll work in the kitchen.
I'll take the bathroom, then.
And just this time, I'll come straight here in the evenings after my other job finishes.
Thank you so much!
You're a real lifesaver!
Ogawa...
Now then, everybody...
Let's give it one more push!
Th-Thank you...
Chief.
All right, good manuscript.
I was a bit worried this time,
but I guess when it comes to you two, I don't need to worry about missing deadlines.
No, it was actually really close.
This time around, it was all thanks to the hard work of our assistants.
I see.
If you can get past something like this, then you'll be all right.
Well done!
Right.
Thank you!
Now, take a look at this.
It's the sample copy of Monday's issue.
It's finally started.
Yeah.
H-He wrote in twins!
Doesn't this sort of count as double protagonists, too?
It's a bit different, but Niizuma understands very well.
He understands just how important the antagonist is in a standard battle manga.
But, in terms of relationships between rivals,
the one between Reversi's black demon Schwarz and white demon Weiss is better.
You think so?
Eiji, I wasn't expecting you to respond like this.
You did it!
Zombie Gun got 767 votes! First place by far and away!
I see.
Come on, Niizuma, can't you get even a little bit excited?
That's this week's sample copy.
Oh, Miura brought you one?
How's Ashirogi's new series? Is it any good?
Well, I don't think it can reach your 767 votes, though.
Yes... yes.
Okay.
Talk to you later.
What rank did we get in the final results?
We got first place by a huge lead!
You did it!
Congratulations!
Thanks!
It's all because of you! So, thank you!
How many votes did we get?
526.
I see.
Last week, Zombie Gun got 767 votes.
But, the real challenge starts now!
Huh?
Niizuma... This is...
Really?
Yeah.
You're in first place again this week.
That's three weeks in a row!
We did it!
And this week, we have a 40 vote gap between us and Zombie Gun in second place!
Wow!
You've won three weeks in a row against Niizuma!
Yeah!
This is the real deal!
Winning against that Eiji, three weeks in row?
No, it can't be this easy.
What's wrong, Mashiro?
Uh, nothing.
Let's keep on getting first place!
Yeah!
Y-Yeah!
Dammit!
Ever since their new series started,
Ashirogi and Master Niizuma have been hogging the top two spots!
It's not a rank to be depressed over.
If it weren't for Zombie Gun and Reversi, you'd be in about third place now.
You're in 7th!
Don't get depressed.
I'm not.
I'm just in shock that Yuri's What God Gave Me is in 17th place!
Oh, I see.
Ashirogi Mutou is an amazing manga author,
but Azuki Miho's an amazing voice actress, too!
Why'd you bring her up all of a sudden?
I knew Miho wouldn't tell anybody.
Tada!
A-Azuki!
Awesome! She's on the front cover!
She's on a roll now because her role as Ai in Impromptu 12 is so popular.
Sh-She said she wanted to stay out of public eye, though.
She still doesn't want to appear on TV, but magazines and radio are okay.
What? Radio?!
Yeah!
She said she has a show starting soon.
That's awesome!
She really hasn't told you anything yet, has she?
She should have, no matter how embarrassed she is...
Things are going swimmingly for both Mashiro and Azuki, though.
The wedding can't be that far off!
Well, at this rate, it feels like things are going too well...
What're you talking about?
You're the one who always had complete confidence in Reversi.
That's right!
Try and go for four weeks in first place!
What is it, all of a sudden?
I thought it'd be faster to show you this in person rather than explain it over the phone.
It's next week's sample copy.
This is...
A new rival!
And he killed the previous rival off like it was nothing!
Having Chapters 2 and 3 in second place isn't bad at all.
But despite that, he cast away this character.
That's Niizuma for you.
He knows how important the antagonist is in standard battle manga.
If the enemy isn't received well, you swap him out.
It's a basic rule of battle manga.
It's not like it got any negative feedback, though.
Yes. It's most likely a knee-jerk reaction to seeing the first chapter of Reversi.
It's to steal first place from you.
He knew it instinctively.
Instinctively?
Yeah.
That his antagonist was weaker than Reversi's.
But it took a long time of trial and error to create our double protagonists.
We can't easily swap them out for new ones like Eiji can.
Good morning.
Hey there.
Third place?!
Yeah.
Zombie Gun is in first with 472 votes.
And in 2nd?
Road Racer GIRI.
So we lost to GIRI, too.
Reversi's in 3rd with 251.
GIRI had 282.
That can't be...
Why did our vote count suddenly drop so much?
They may have realized it.
When Eiji swapped out his enemy character, I felt it myself.
The readers may have realized it as well.
Realized what?
Reversi's weakness.
Weakness?
The fundamental premise of Reversi is having two enemies and rivals: our double protagonists.
We can't use the basic rule of battle manga Hattori talked about,
which is swapping out enemies if they become unpopular.
You're right. It certainly is a weakness.
We have to take the confrontation between Schwarz and Weiss all the way until the end.
Takagi.
Oh, sorry.
We may need to further discuss this at some point.
But for now, focus continuing the story in a way that best utilizes this premise.
I understand.
Talk to you later.
You too.
Double protagonists, huh?
How far can I take these two?
How long will it remain interesting?
Saikou.
Yeah?
You texted Azuki and told her that her role in our anime would be her greatest ever, right?
Yeah, I did.
How many volumes of Impromptu 12 are there?
Uh, 42 or 43, I think.
Of course. It's a popular manga that's been serialized for eight years already.
That's how long I'll have to keep this going. Or maybe even longer.
I'll have to make this a manga that won't lose to Niizuma Eiji and Zombie Gun.
And one that'll become an anime.
In any case, I have to make this last as long as possible with just Schwarz and Weiss.
So that Reversi becomes a flagship series, for Saikou and Azuki's sake!
How is it?
There's a lot of fighting in this one.
It's a standard battle manga, after all.
With this, you can draw battle scenes to your heart's content, right?
Yeah.
Well then, go ahead and make a clean storyboard.
Chapter 5 is in 5th place.
5th place?!
Well, it just started, so I think it's a bit early to think about changing the setting yet.
You're right.
We can't alter our premise of having two protagonists,
so even if it drops a little bit, we have no choice but to continue.
Yeah.
Hattori.
I've already finished the storyboard for Chapter 9, if you want to take a look.
Okay.
It's well done, but it feels a bit thin.
I think so, too.
So far, the chapters have been rich in content, and the story progressed quickly.
Chapter 9 is clearly much slower, though.
Yes. Mashiro's correct.
It's not bad to have a chapter centered on battles,
but in the end, Takagi's strengths lie in psychological warfare and tactics.
Dense stories.
Uh, well, if I pushed their confrontation along, the series would get a lot shorter.
Hattori, you said before that we have to make this manga a mainstay of Jack, right?
A mainstay is a flagship series, right?
Yeah.
When we talk about Jack flagships,
Dragonball, One Piece, and Naruto come to mind.
Works with a long duration that sell more than a million copies!
Yes.
There's no doubt that the manga you've spoken of are flagships.
And Saikou,
even you said that you wanted it gain flagship status, an anime, and a long run!
I never said I wanted it to have a long run.
I did say I wanted the first two things, though.
Th-Then, are you okay with it ending before Zombie Gun?!
If it's good, then I'm fine with that.
The ideal would be to maintain popularity over a long run, but...
But?
A manga that runs through all its content at once is fine, too.
If you develop the conflict between Schwarz and Weiss in a way that plays to your strengths,
then I don't think this series will last very long.
However, the length of our run isn't important.
It's the quality of our work.
Remember why we wanted to do Reversi as a weekly series?
It's because we're trying to get the top spot in Weekly Shounen Jack, right?
Let's aim for the top, dash forward, and come up with the best possible ending.
I know that you... that Reversi, can do it.
If that means it'll be short, then so be it.
Good evening everyone! This is Azuki Miho!
Um, tonight is my first show, so I'm pretty nervous.
Well then, let me jump right into it.
Azukyun Night
Hello?
Sorry, but do you have a minute?
Yeah.
It's really okay if Reversi doesn't last long, right?
This again?
Then, I've got to spit this out.
Spit what out?
I've pretty much decided already how the conflict between Schwarz and Weiss will end.
And after their confrontation is over, I don't want to pull out a new enemy.
Yeah, I know.
Reversi isn't that kind of manga.
If we resolve that conflict in the most interesting way I can think of,
and execute it in one go without letting the readers catch their breath,
it won't last more than one or two years...
No, it'll probably only top out at 50 chapters.
That's fine.
I believe in you.
Just write whatever you think is most interesting,
and we'll end it the way you want to.
Seriously?
Yes, really.
Because you're the author.
If you write Reversi like that,
it'll definitely become a masterpiece.
It may be short, but if people acknowledge it,
everything else will follow.
Do you think it'll get an anime?
It will.
And if it doesn't have the best role for Azuki, I'll be upset.
You said it.
This may be the first time I've ever asked this of you,
but, for me and Azuki, and also for you, please turn this into a masterpiece.
I'm counting on you, Shuujin!
All right! I'll write without wasting a single word!
We don't need any unnecessary elements!
That sound good to you?!
Yeah! I'll draw it with all I have!
All right, let's forge ahead!

Why, I wonder?
Whenever I am close to fulfilling my goals, all effort becomes fruitless
We walk ahead, hold each other, and with little things
we support each other to reach what we promised
When we lack confidence, we put a hand to our heart
and reread the pages we assembled into a story
They lead up to today and continue into the morrow
We will always be ourselves
until the day that our dreams come true
