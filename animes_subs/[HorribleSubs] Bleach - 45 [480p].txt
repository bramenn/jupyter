Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
My love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
My body feels heavy My legs
I cant raise my arm either
Damn, I guess
the end is nearing for my time as a Quincy
Thats right!
If Im the first one here, I could rescue Rukia myself.
I bet Ichigo wants to save her himself.
If I did that, hed be ticked off.
I bear no ill feelings.
However, for the sake of the peace, Ive no choice but to eliminate you.
Cry, Suzumushi.
Forgive me, Ryoka.
This is the end of a senseless battle.
Sleep. Your battle will soon be over.
To advance from Shikai” to Bankai”
typically requires well over ten years of training,
even for those with talent.
However, you must achieve the Bankai” in three days.
Wh-What is that strange doll?
Tenshintai.
It is one of the Stealth Squads most important specialized spirit tools.
It forcibly draws out the zanpaku-tos true form and materializes it.
Uh? I dont quite get it.
Hows that thing necessary for the Bankai training?
What is necessary for the Shikai
is a dialogue and harmony with the zanpaku-to.
In other words,
instead of us entering the world of the zanpaku-to,
what is necessary for the Bankai”
is the materialization” and submission” of the zanpaku-to.
Materialization” refers to summoning the zanpaku-to into our world.
Normally, several years of training are required for this,
but you, even though it ended in a draw,
fought on equal footing with Kenpachi Zaraki.
So in actuality, you may have already reached the materialization
or a comparable level as I see it.
Do you want to fight?
It seems you recall an instance
If you stab this with Zangetsu,
it can forcibly bring it into the materialized” state.
In other words, we can bring the zanpaku-to into this world.
However
Using this method, the materialization” is limited to three days!
During that period, you must defeat the materialized” Zangetsu
and force him into submission.
If you cannot
I wont ask about that.
If this is the only way
Then Ive got to do it!
Seems you have recovered quite a bit, Ichigo.
Dude!
You heard our conversation?
Of course.
Ill leave the fighting methods to you.
Can you start right away?
Yeah
Wh-What the heck?!
Among these, only one is the true me.
That is the only one that can defeat me.
If you wish to force me into submission,
find it before I kill you!
And
Slay me if you can!
FOUR
Greetings, everyone.
It is I, Squad Four, Third Seat, Yasochika Iemura.
What? You dont know me?!
You may have seen me here, or over there.
Since it seems some of you are not familiar with me,
as an introduction, I wish to disclose my medical journal
that chronicles our Squad Fours strenuous activities.
Hey, hurry it up! Reporting!
Lately, due to the recent Ryoka disturbance,
our Squad Four station is in daily chaos!
Especially, with the large number of those louts from Squad 11 hospitalized.
No! I mean, those gentlemen it has kept us very busy.
On top of that, yesterday evening,
both the Squad 13 and 8 captains requested to have a Ryoka admitted
so we were forced to implement the three-shift emergency protocol.
Things are busy enough as is,
and on top of this, being asked to admit the Ryoka is just
Really, enough is enough!
Why these defeated Ryoka should be purposely hospitalized
and treated in the first place is completely beyond me!
I mean, the Squad 13s Captain Ukitake is one thing,
but Captain Kyoraku of Squad Eight is always goofing off
and chasing after girls behinds and with that gaudy attire,
always snoozing when something comes up.
How can someone like that become a captain, while I!
What is it?
Just now, we received a request from Captain Tosen of Squad Nine
to admit one Ryoka.
I see.
And
You were thinking out loud.
However, I have the deepest respect for Captain Kyoraku.
In light of these points!
He who was held by the Ryoka!
was physically and mentally subjugated by those Ryoka
and had no choice but to obey. That is my opinion!
Therefore! I sincerely request that Captain Unohana of Squad Four
judge the matter kindly!
This concludes the arrest report from Captain Ukitake of Squad 13!
I understand.
However, the damage caused by these Ryoka,
whom you have aided, is substantial.
In light of your rank and responsibilities,
I cannot condone your actions.
You do understand?
Fourteenth Advanced Relief Group Leader
and Squad Four, Seventh Seat, Hanataro Yamada.
Whats the matter, Hanataro?
I wonder if what I did was a mistake.
Did I create more trouble for Rukia instead?
Who knows
However, seeing how you act so true to your feelings,
Im a bit envious of you.
Lieutenant!
The rest is up to Captain Unohana
Lets go, Zabimaru!
I-I drew my sword against Miss Hinamori.
How could I Despicable Imdespicable!
Burst! Tobiume!
Raise your head, Wabisuke!
Wh-Whos there?!
My
This is just awful. Cant bear to look.
CaptainIchimaru!
You look haggard, poor thing.
Want me to help you?
Huh, Izuru?
Stand up, Ichigo!
Three days! Ichigo, you dont have time to dawdle!
Ill say it once more. Stand up, Ichigo!
Stop stalling! Are you going to waste time?!
Never mind!
If he cannot stand on his own then Ill drag him to his feet!
ELEVEN
My, was I ever surprised!
To think that Lieutenant Kusajishi would pick me up at that place!
I, Makizo Aramaki, am moved beyond words!
WellI didnt really care about you.
Letmego!
Please let me go!
Oh, no, I cant!
Why you-!
Sorry about that.
Maybe I should apologize when she wakes up.
Maki-Maki? Whats that youre carrying?
That Spiritual Pressure A Ryoka?
No. Wellyou see, this, well
Thats a Ryoka, right?
This is, well, umm there were circumstances
Circumstances? Oh, like what?
Wellthat is
This girl, you seeum she suddenly spurted out of this area
Spurted out?
Yes, yes. Likebubbling.
Bubbling?
So I thought it was very unusual,
and I wanted to show you.
Really?!
Then lets take her back with us!
Eh? Well
I want to see her doing the bubbling thing!
Well, thats
I wonder if Ichi does the bubbling too?
Hey, Ara Ara umm
Arawhats your name again?
Ah! Pardon me! Its Maki-Maki! Maki-Maki is fine!
Its been ten years since you so kindly took me into your care!
Maki-Maki
Wha-?! But thats the nickname you gave me!
So, whats happening, Orihime?
Shes beautiful
Is Ichigo still alive?
I want him to be alive. No, Im sure hes alive!
Orihime
Hes alive.
I can tell.
Hes alive and hes trying to get stronger still. Interesting!
Ill lend you a hand, woman.
If I stick with you,
I get the feeling Ill see Ichigo again!
Yep! Yes!
Aye, aye, sir!
FOUR
Where is this?
Am I alive?
How?
Are you awake?
Wh-What are you, who are you?!
Are you a burglar, you jerk?!
Idiot! Why would anyone try to steal from an injured man in prison?
Its me, me!
G-Ganju?! Youre alive! Good!
You didnt seem too strong so I thought maybe
That line Ill throw it right back at you.
Still Why did they treat our injuries?
Were intruders and also their enemy.
There shouldnt be any reason for the Soul Society to treat us.
The situation has changed.
Sado.
I overheard the guard talking and found out.
Apparently, a Captain was assassinated within the Seireitei.
The culprit is unknown.
What?
So were the prime suspects in the case.
Weve been kept alive for their investigation.
Thats what it means.
If only my Spiritual Pressure wasnt sealed with these things.
We could bust right out of here with my Seppa right away.
I see These seal the Spiritual Pressure.
Too strong of a flame, and you will burn yourself.
Sanreishuto you must never remove this glove.
If you remove the glove,
for a moment you will gain enormous powers, however
you will surely lose all your Quincy powers as well.
No. Even without this, my Spiritual Pressures already
Anyway!
Although we did survive,
were stuck in this prison with our Spiritual Pressure sealed,
and it really sucks!
However, one things for sure.
As long as the enemy has no intention of killing us,
the rest of the gang is sure to be alive as well!
Seeing that we are captured like this,
we can assume that Orihime, whos not suited for combat,
is probably detained somewhere as well.
That leaves just Yoruichi and Ichigo.
I will wait for Ichigo.
Ichigo will come here without fail.
What we can do until then
is heal our wounds and prepare for the next battle.
Lets wait for Ichigo!
Eighteenth sword
Thats it!
The real one
has to be this!
Too weak!
As Ive said. All these swords represent a piece of your heart.
The purpose of this trial is to find the one piece among these
that was forged just for combat alone.
That one there was your hearts frailty” for trying to depend on me.
Frailtymy being prone to depending heart
As long as you cannot even discern that,
dont dare mention the word Bankai!”
So these are all my weaknesses
Damn it!
Well! Next one, Ichigo!
You don't have time to be kneeling!
Yeah
Thats right!
Happy people
Come on, come on, come on
Happy people
Here we go!
Everybody stand up! Everybody fight!
Within your heart, you may feel uneasy
But keep your head right up!
To the sky!
No matter when (Oh yeah!)
No matter where (Oh yeah!)
Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!)
Ill be here for you
Happy people in the house!!!
With a tough smile
Happy people in the house!!!
Lets live!
Wow
Happy people in the house
All right
Happy people
The food was bad in the Squad Six jail.
Squad Three's jail didn't get any sunlight.
Squad Five's jail had cockroaches!
There's definitely room for improvement.
You guys don't seem to get why you were put in jail!
Why don't you try it, Shiro-chan? I will not!
