If you go to somewhere else
But
The truth is, I want to be by your side more than anyone else
Lets go take a walk in chains of love!
Her Highness's Zero
Her Highness's Zero
Next Time
The Vow of Wind and Water
I'll go home.
I'll...
This is...
Tokyo's...
Akihabara!
It's a sailor uniform!
A real sailor uniform!
Check it out, Louise. This is Japan's Akiba -
Louise?
Where are you, Louise?
Louise?
Come out.
That's right... I came back to Japan by myself.
I was summoned as a familiar to a strange world by an incompetent mage, Louise,
and was dragged into a war.
I found this Zero and finally managed to come back, but...
There's...
There's no point in coming back to Japan without Louise!
Louise...
Louise!
Huh?
Where am I?
What's wrong, Saito?
Louise?
Louise!
Thank goodness.
Thank goodness, I thought you went away somewhere...
Saito...
Hey!
Ow...
Stop making a ruckus out of your dream, would you?
Haven't you been a little full of yourself lately?
No, I'm...
Yes, you did give up on returning to your world and chose to stay as my familiar.
I'm really grateful for that.
I'm not lying.
That's why I won't call you a dog anymore,
make you sleep on the floor or whip you.
So...
You better take your eyes off the maid and the other girls and look only at me!
Do you hear me?!
Huh?
You're a familiar, so it's only natural for you to look only at your master.
Right, okay.
If you get it, then go back to sleep already.
Yo, partner.
No matter what you guys say to each other, you're getting along well.
But I wonder how long that'll last.
I shall now explain the procedure for leaving the ceremony.
Cardinal Masarini...
I do not need a crown.
And here you are being selfish again.
We are in the middle of a war.
Although we have halted Albion's march, we cannot let our guard down.
The citizens are wishing for you to become the true Queen...
Praise Princess Henrietta!
Praise Tristain!
Time for food?
Today's the coronation ceremony, so I bet even a captive like myself would be served a special meal.
Unfortunately, there's no Last Supper for you.
You are...!
Cromwell,
how foolish of you to become a captive after going through...
Luckily, in the midst of the coronation ceremony, I was able to retrieve the Ring of Andvari.
Please, give me another chance!
They used a magic I've never seen before!
A huge light appeared all of a sudden and annihilated my troops!
That might have been...
Void?
Y-Yes, that was completely unexpected.
It was not my responsibility!
Don't worry. You'll never have to take responsibility again.
Wait! Wait!
S-Stop it...
Stop it!
Hey, let's get going.
The Princess' parade is going to end.
Saito, I have a present for you.
Here, take it.
Is this a pair of glasses?
I have fine eyesight if you ask me.
It isn't an ordinary pair of glasses.
I asked my elder sister to send one of our family treasures.
Louise, you have an elder sister?
Just put them on already.
Okay...
Oh yeah, I remember you saying that you're the youngest...
I can't take it off!
Let's get going.
Siesta!
S-Saito!
Siesta!
Saito-san!
Saito-san, what's that?
Are you working today, too?
Do you want to go check out the parade with us?
No, I'm...
What's wrong?
I know...
That's...!
So...
This is...
So...
U-Um... What's with those glasses?
Huh? What's this?
They won't come off.
Those Medusa's Glasses are a magical item.
Any time you look at a girl other than myself, the one who gave them to you, with lascivious eyes,
the gems around them glow.
W-What's with that?
I didn't hear about that!
You need only look at your master.
To stare at other girls when you're a familiar...
With lustrous eyes...
With dilated eyes...
With bloodshot eyes!
No, I wasn't...
Where exactly were you looking?
That maid's face, perhaps?
Or...
I see...
L-Louise-san?
I see. You were looking at her boobs.
So, you like big ones that much?
So you like big boobs.
Louise! Hold on!
So, the bigger ones are better for you!
Ah, it's Miss Valliere and Saito-kun again.
Hey, Louise.
Montmorency.
Are you two off to watch the parade as well?
You two get along well as always.
Just like us, Montmorency.
Look, Louise.
Since today's a day to celebrate, I'm wearing an outgoing dress.
Ow...
Isn't it a little short?
This is nothing.
Saito.
Oh, it's those two again.
Kirche!
Tabitha.
I can't believe you.
I can understand Kirche, but who knew you were eyeing Tabitha, too.
Is female the only trait that you need?
Pretty much...
No, that's not true!
I won't look.
I won't look at anyone else anymore...
Fine.
You keep your eyes shut until we go back to our room.
Okay...
Princess!
Look, Saito!
What are you doing closing your eyes?
She looks so majestic.
S-Saito.
How dare you eye the Princess... no, the Queen...
Wait, Louise! Not here!
You're...
You're the worst!
We have a ruffian!
Protect Our Highness!
Captain. I assume it was them.
Arrest them!
Sir!
Saito...
I am Her Highness' court lady, Louise de La Valliere.
I need to talk with Her Highness!
Let me through here!
You cannot!
We have been ordered to not let anybody through.
Just let me through!
La Valliere-dono.
Drop your wand!
A gun is faster than spell casting.
Her Highness is in a meeting with Principal Osmond.
I shall hear what you need to say in her stead.
Principal Osmond?
And you are...?
Agnes Chevalier de Milan.
Captain of the Musketeer Force.
Musketeer Force?
You're the one that arrested Saito, aren't you?
Release Saito!
Saito?
The culprit.
Saito isn't the culprit!
I caused the explosion.
The idiot was eyeing the Princess...
A-Anyway, give me back Saito!
To hell with this present!
I guess I'm treated like this, after all.
Then, in the future...
Louise will get married with some stupid aristocrat.
I'll praise the two from afar,
and end my life as a familiar.
Damn it, I should have returned to Japan.
If I can't return home, then I'd rather pick a different girl.
The Queen was beautiful.
Saito-san.
Saito-san.
Saito-san.
Y-Your Highness!
Why are you here?
I came to see you.
See me?
You don't say...
Saito-san...
She can't be...
No! That's way too much!
Saito-san.
I have a favour to ask of you.
If you desire so much...
You insolent fool!
How dare you touch the hands of the Queen!
I'll shoot you right this moment!
Agnes, please stand back.
I want to talk to him alone.
But...!
It is fine.
It's fine.
You keep quiet!
Agnes!
Next time I will shoot you regardless of what Her Highness says!
Saito-san, are you hurt?
We're finally alone.
Yes.
Then...
From the information gathered by Intelligence and from what Principal Osmond said,
it was you and Louise who defeated the Albion force.
We are certain that it was done by the void mage and her familiar, Gandalfr.
T-That's...
Could you...
Could you lend us your power?
Right now, the entire country is at war.
The military in particular is saying we should take the opportunity and march into Albion.
Cardinal Masarini and the senior statesmen seem to agree with the military.
But I want to avoid war, if possible.
Saito-san.
So, this is the Gandalfr's insignia?
Yes.
Please, along with Louise, help me with your power.
Well, Louise said that she'd do anything if it's for you, so...
I am asking you personally.
Please become one of my few allies.
One of the few?
Being a Queen is inconvenient.
There are only a handful of people who can truly understand and help me.
Will you accept my request?
All right...
What a relief.
Thank you very much.
But for now, please stay at the Magic Academy with Louise.
I want to keep you two undercover.
Enemies exist within the Kingdom, too.
Spies, you mean?
A few hours ago, inside the jail for aristocrats,
Lord Cromwell was assassinated.
A multi-layered Lock spell had been cast there.
Someone who could dispel a Lock must have led the culprit through.
Could that really happen?
Saito-san.
If there is anything you want as a reward for your cooperation, please say it.
Anything?
Yes, anything.
As long as it is within my capabilities.
Then...
Agnes.
Please bring Miss Valliere over.
Ma'am!
L-Louise?!
Saito.
Wait! You got it wrong! You got it all wrong!
S-Saito!
Idiot...
You idiot...
Saito, you idiot...
How dare you make me worry.
Louise.
Hey, what's that?
Heresiarch's Book of Invocation.
Princess gave it to me.
She said that it'd be better for me to hold onto it.
Apparently, it's passed down through the Tristain's royal family.
What's this?
According to Principal Osmond's research,
void spells should be written in it.
Should be? But there's nothing there.
A misprint?
Or it could be...
What, did you figure something out?
White paper. In other words, nothingness.
Fight with an empty mind, perhaps?
Sparkle
Don't you often see that kind of line in manga?
Manga?
Oh yeah, I haven't read manga in a while.
Saito, do you feel that you should have returned home?
Well, a little.
But...
I can't leave you alone in a dangerous place like this.
Saito.
From now on, Miss Valliere, the Queen's words shall be passed down to you via a member of the Musketeer Force.
The code name for you two is Zero.
Is that understood?
Y-Yes!
And Hiraga Saito.
I shall overlook today, but if you act in a perverse manner towards the Queen in the future, be prepared.
Saito...
Yes!
What's this perverse manner?
You dog!
Pervert dog!
Dog in heat!
Hentai Dog!
Liar, you said that you'd never call me a dog or whip me!
You dare talk back to me, perverted dog?!
It's your own fault!
It's because you wag your tail at every girl!
And to... the... the... P-Pri...
Priceless Joumon artefact?
Acting lecherously towards the Queen...
I won't forgive you.
Hold it, Louise! Calm down!
I knew that this was going to happen.
Die!
Valliere-dono!
Pardon me.
Actually, it is an emergency, so forgive me!
The Queen has been kidnapped by somebody!
You dog, get a move on!
The Princess got taken away by Prince Wales, who's supposed to have passed away.
Zero no Tsukaima. Futatsuki no Kishi.
The Vow of Wind and Water.
If you want to meet me again next week, then sit tightly and wait!
