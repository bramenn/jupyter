All right, homeroom's over!
Okay, guys, give it your all today!
Okay!
Hey, but that was fast. How long has it been since we became second-years?
We're already so used to it now, aren't we?
But I'm so glad that we all got to be in the same class.
And we have Ms. Kyoko again.
Right. Especially for you.
The day they announced what class we'd be in, this one was so happy she was in tears.
Ruri!
You really are a sweetheart, Onodera!
Isn't it great that we even have the same seats?
What's so great about that?
Really, Ruri!
Oh, I get it!
Because you're sitting near me, Ruri!
I knew it, you couldn't bear to be separated from me
Could you like, shut up for a second?
If only they'd assigned you alone to another class,
we'd have nothing to complain about.
Seishiro, as usual, you're being perverse.
I wish that Kirisaki had been assigned to another class, too.
Why don't you go?
The way I see it,
there are even more hot ladies in this class, so I'm satisfied!
Why, you...
June 3, On Duty: Raku Ichijo, Ruri Miyamoto
Hey, who's on duty today?
There are some handouts leftover!
Who was it today?
Totally forgot about it.
Yeah.
Anyway, isn't there anything you can do about that cohort of yours?
He's altogether too lacking in scruples.
He's been like that as long as I can remember, so...
It must be hard on you, too.
Well, although whoever that moron's crushing on should be pitied as well.
Wait...
Do you know who it is?
Who that guy has a crush on?
What are you talking about?
Support
Hey, it isn't fair for you to know who I like and not vice-versa.
Hey, so who is it? This girl that you like?
All right, time for a quiz!
Who is the girl that I like?
Well, how should I know?
Wait. Could it be...?
You said you got two Valentine's chocolates.
Could it be one of them?
Bingo! Bingo! Right on the money!
For real? So I nailed it just like that?
Yeah, but which is the right answer?
Well, I'd hate to give either one up.
One is a pure, cool beauty,
while the other is a perky, active beauty with dyed blond hair, so...
Then is it Tanaka from Class D, the girl you sometimes talk to?
Bingo! Bingo! Right on the money!
Tanaka-cchi's a fine gal, too. So broad-minded and all...
Jeez. You're not even gonna give me a straight answer.
No, no, I'm dead serious, you know.
It's just that my love and respect for women is far too overpowering!
As a male high school student, that's something to be proud of!
You keep getting clobbered because you go around spewing stuff like that.
Is there some reason why you can't tell me?
No, it's not like that, really.
But just like you have your own way of conducting romance,
I, too, have my own way. That's all.
I think you'll be fine carrying on like you always have.
I mean, it's so entertaining for those of us observing.
Hey, you're making fun of me, aren't you?
And besides, in my case,
my target is an unattainable flower, way beyond my reach.
Whoops! Was that too big a hint?
Well, never mind about me!
Good luck to you in your endeavors!
Hey, wait! Hey, we're not done talking yet!
Hello, Seishiro!
Would you be so kind as to give me an American-style hug?
Seriously. Is he like that year-round?
Hey, Tsugumi.
What's up?
Unattainable flower, huh?
Wh-What is it? Don't stare at me like that!
Listen, has anyone ever said you were like a flower?
What kind of drivel is that, all of a sudden?
Listen, what would you do if you fell in love with someone?
Hey... Hey, hold up! What the hell are you talking about?!
For example, if he were someone unattainable...
Someone you could never hope would love you back, what would you do?
Hey, my bad!
Come to think of it, you haven't experienced first love yet, right?
Sorry to ask such an awkward question.
I'd probably hide it...
I'd never tell a soul how I felt, and never tell him either...
and I would go on hiding it until the day that romance ended.
W-Well, but I have no experience in any of that, so I have no idea!
Needless to say!
Hmm, is that right?
But that sounded like the opinion of a grownup with tons of experience.
You girls really are incredible. I think I underestimated you.
Did you?
Well, not that it makes me happy to hear praise from you!
But Tsugumi, if you really wanted to,
I think you could get any guy that you wanted.
What do you know about it, huh?!
What? Why?
So it's not Tsugumi, huh?
Still, just remembering it makes my blood boil!
He always, always has that contemptuous attitude.
Thoughtless jerks like him annoy me more than anything.
Come to think of it,
there's something he's never even told his best friend, Ichijo...
Hey, there's someone I'm in love with!
I wonder why he would tell me?
Staff Room
Here you go! Thanks for waiting!
I've come to deliver the materials you requested!
Thanks, Maiko.
Hey, sorry to make you help me out.
No, no, since it's a request from the one and only Kyoko!
But in return, may I ask you to add five points to that English test?
I'm counting on you.
I don't recall ever entering such a secret contract with you.
I think I'll give you these leftover cookies.
I thank you for your generosity!
What else did you want me to fetch for you?
Oh, no, I can take care of...
Maiko, why don't I give you a heads-up?
Yes?
See... I'm getting married next month.
I'm quitting to get married.
I'll be leaving after this month.
Whoa! If that isn't the most splendid news!
Congratulations, Kyoko!
Awww, hey, you're embarrassing me! Thanks!
Really, this makes me happy!
Our very own Kyoko, somehow snagging a husband just before she hits thirty!
I certainly can't help breathing a sigh of relief...
Shut up, you idiot! Lay off about that!
Please invite me to your wedding, all right?
Because I want to catch your bouquet!
You'd better not mess with grownups.
All right, be safe on your way home.
Right...
You know what? You're the only mature one in the bunch.
Don't forget to enjoy your youth!
Uh... today I have an important announcement to make.
I'm getting married, so I'll be quitting after this month.
Hey, so you have a boyfriend, Kyoko!
This month? But it's almost up already!
Hey, when are you getting married? What's your husband like?
Wow! Ms. Kyoko's getting married!
That was a huge announcement, for sure.
So wonderful! But I think we're going to miss her...
Are we all gonna get married, too, someday?
I don't know, but you're probably set anyway, right?
You could probably make a great home with Onodera.
Why are you just taking something like that for granted?
Seriously, this is totally unfair, after all!
Why don't you just give it up? Who you're crushing on?
I'll tell you, if you can guess, Raku.
All right, is it Ms. Kyoko?
You guys were tight, and you'll miss her when she's gone, won't you?
Bingo, bingo! Right on the money!
Kyoko's a babe, and everybody loves her, and we're all gonna miss her!
That's unusual.
You just lied, didn't you?
What are you talking about, Raku?
It only happens once in a blue moon, but I can tell.
Since way back when... whenever something happened to you...
Not that I can always tell, but...
Just once in a while, there are times when I can tell...
Hey, this guy is lying right now, you know?
When we were in sixth grade, and your mom was in the hospital,
you always had the same look on your face.
So terrifying...
These childhood friends...
Seriously?
Seriously. I'm dead serious.
Since when?
Right after we started high school.
It was like love at first sight.
I had no idea...
You aren't going to tell her how you feel?
Well, of course I'm not.
She's getting married, you know?
It would only put her on the spot if I confessed to her now.
Making sure I have no regrets...
that would just be self-serving, nothing more.
I know, but...
It's all right, Raku.
I mean, this is a great memory in itself, right?
I've decided to take this unrequited love,
and quietly put it away in a corner of my heart as a bittersweet page of my youth.
It's unfortunate, but I'm fine with that.
I see.
He has a point. It wouldn't do any good to confess now, right?
Wouldn't do... any good, right?
Is that really true?
If I were Shu,
and one day I had to say goodbye to someone I loved without even telling her how I felt...
Wouldn't I have any regrets?
If I...
If I were never going to see Onodera again,
if it were me, I'd want to tell her how I felt... I think...
I know.
Let's say Onodera was getting married to someone else
Although just imagining that is like inflicting horrible damage on my soul...
But...
Yeah, I see it.
If Onodera was really in love with that person, and happy with him,
I wouldn't want to get in her way.
Confess my love...
True, I don't think I'd do it. But...
What's this? How unusual.
For you to consult me about something.
Sorry, all of a sudden.
Remember how I asked you yesterday,
What if you fell in love with someone unattainable?
What? That topic again?
So anyway,
If that person were to suddenly say he was getting married,
what would you do then?
Do you think you'd take one last chance to tell him how you felt?
Married?
I was wondering about this yesterday, too, but who are you talking about?
Don't tell me Young Mistress is getting married?!
With somebody other than you?!
No, no, no!
This is just an example, okay?
So? What would you do?
What would I do?
I don't think I'd tell him about my feelings.
Since he'd be getting married, it would only cause him trouble.
So you do feel that way, huh?
But... Would you really be okay with that?
Could you really live with that?
Most likely...
It's not a matter of being able to live with it or not.
I believe it can't be helped.
If there's nothing else you can do, then there's nothing else you can do.
How can you sit there and be so realistic when you have no experience?
You amaze me.
Huh? No... I'm not really!
I'm just telling you what I think I would do.
But...
just as I thought...
That's how you see it.
Are you really getting married, Ms. Kyoko?
Lucky you, getting married!
Would it really be wrong to tell her at a time like this how he feels?
This is just so out of the blue!
I'm so envious!
Hey, Ms. Kyoko, what kind of person is he?
Is he hot?
He's just an ordinary guy.
Well, when I'm with him, I guess it sets my mind at ease.
Whaaat? He's ordinary? That's so boring!
Come on, can't you swoon a little?
Hey, let's throw Kyoko a farewell party!
Good idea! Let's do it!
Let's make it one to remember!
But...
I...
It's tomorrow, huh? Ms. Kyoko's last day.
Yeah, it is.
You know how you're always rooting for my romance to work out?
Well, although a lot of things you do can't really be called supportive.
Now, now...
So now I'm gonna support you, too.
If you're gonna send Ms. Kyoko off without saying anything to her,
then I'll support your decision not to say anything.
That's about all I can do.
So after Ms. Kyoko's gone, at least let me buy you dinner, just once.
Hey, thanks, Raku.
The next day...
Ms. Kyoko's last day at our school.
Come back here, Raku Ichijo!
Tsugumi?
I'm only gonna say this once! Listen up!
Yesterday, you asked me, right?
If I ever fell in love with someone,
and he was going to marry someone else,
would I tell him how I felt or not...
And if I decided not to tell him, could I live with that?
Tsugumi...
Why you would ask me such a thing, what it is that's eating away at you, I have no clue.
I have no clue, but...
Yesterday, I believe my answer was misleading, so I'm going to correct myself.
Because as someone you've consulted, I want to be responsible.
I told you, didn't I?
That it wasn't a matter of being able to live with it or not?
However...
I believe it's just that you have no choice but to live with it,
and it doesn't mean you want to live with it.
You probably wouldn't be able to live with it.
I don't know much about these things, but this emotion called love...
That must be how it works.
W-Well, not that I have any clue about such emotions!
Since I've never fallen in love with anyone yet...
Thanks, Tsugumi.
Huh? Was that Darling?
What were you two talking about?
Just... about a theoretical romance.
Shu...
I...
On second thought, I...
Goodbye!
Bye, guys!
Yo, Raku! What's going on?
Pretty unusual. Are you ditching, too?
You look like you're hurting.
Do I?
Yeah.
I do, huh?
Shu... I'm gonna say something just a little bit uncalled for now, okay?
I might be just as clueless as you always say I am.
I have no idea what other people are feeling unless they tell me.
I think you're doing the right thing, okay?
I think it's the considerate, mature call to make.
But still.
I also think that you should do what it is that you really want to do.
I'm going to support you.
If you're not gonna do anything, I'll support you for not doing anything.
And if necessary...
I'll also give you a push.
What would you be giving me a push for, Raku?
I've just had my heart broken in spectacular fashion.
What can I do when the romance is long over?
It's all right.
I don't have a single regret.
Well, that lie...
I don't think it even has to be me to spot it.
You know what? You're the only mature one in the bunch.
Don't forget to enjoy your youth!
Raku...
Could you give my back one hell of a push?
She's at the taxi stand in front of the crosswalk!
Go!
I...
But...
Seriously, that Four Eyes...
Where did he go, ditching his duties?
Hey, Maiko! This is your job...
Was that... Maiko?
Thank you!
Right!
Teacher!
Maiko?
Hey, you are enjoying your youth.
You're gonna make an awesome man someday.
Take care, Maiko!
Did I meddle too much?
No.
Hey, Raku...
You promised me.
Treat me to some octopus balls!
Did I do the right thing, I wonder?
Hey, thanks, Raku.
I got it out of my system.
Even though it wasn't my style, I guess it's not half bad, this kind of thing.
You think so?
So? What are you gonna do, Raku?
About what?
Don't tell me you're not gonna do a thing about Onodera
after you just made me confess my feelings?
No... that's actually, uh...
I know where you're coming from, but it's really complicated, see?
I was only kidding. I think it's all good!
For you to go at your own pace.
But no regrets, okay?
If you're ever on the verge of making a choice that you'll regret,
then I'll be the one to kick your butt!
Right...
Shu, you really are amazing.
Since I think if you told me to confess to Onodera,
I'd have a really hard time...
Ichijo?
Where were you today?
You vanished all of a sudden, and I was so worried!
My bad, something came up...
But...
Hey, listen, Onodera.
Sorry to spring this on you all of a sudden...
Want to go home with me today?
B-But why? Is something wrong?
Why?
No... I just kind of feel like it, I guess...
Sure, fine.
Someday, I will, too...
