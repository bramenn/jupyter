J Pokemon! J
Several months have passed since Ash left his home town of Pallet
on his Pokemon journey.
After lots of adventures and discoveries,
the gang finds themselves somewhere in the mountains.
-We sure have traveled a long way. -Yeah, we've seen tons of places.
-I wonder where we should go now? -Pi.
That's easy. We have to go to the next gym so we can get another badge.
-Well, Fuchsia Gym isn't far from here. -Where is it?
Uh, over the mountain.
- Uh... - Mm...
-Uh, Brock, over which mountain? - The map says the Fuchsia Gym's
on the other side of one of those mountains right over there.
Is it this way or that way? Or maybe it's that way?
Oh, great.
We're surrounded by mountains on every side.
Don't tell me. We're lost again.
-Okay, I won't tell you. -Kachu?
Wait a minute. It looks like there's a road here.
Well, let's hit it.
Dig Those Diglett!
-I'm having some lovely Chinese food. -It's tea and crumpets for me.
Nothing for Meowth. I'm getting a gut.
- Work that body. -Cheers!
I wonder what that was.
-I didn't get a taste. -I didn't get a sip.
That's the breaks.
But I wonder where that big blast came from.
It's over there.
My lunch break is ruined.
No tea party for me.
Someone's going to pay for this!
Hey, wait for me!
This place looks like a battle zone.
Maybe we're being attacked by aliens from another planet.
What planet are you from?
-What a wreck! -This is terrible!
-Oh, the destruction. -And we didn't cause it.
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig...
Chu!
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
Diglett.
Pika.
Pikachu.
Diglett.
So that's it.
I just can't take it anymore.
Are you all right?
It's the Diglett. They're destroying everything.
-The Diglett? -See, they're right over there.
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig...
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
Oh, look how cute.
You think they're cute, do you?
Thanks to them we can't finish building that dam.
I hate Diglett! I hate them!
Hmm. Diglett.
Diglett. The movement of these ground Pokemon
can be easily detected by their tracks of upturned earth.
Hmm. I don't see any upturned earth.
That's because the ground here is covered by concrete,
but if you look closely...
-They're underneath. -It looks like a mini-earthquake.
And it looks like we'll never be able to accomplish our dream
of building the great Giva Dam here in these mountains.
-Giva Dam? -Over there.
All right! Let her rip!
That blasting is part of building a dam?
Yes, the blasting is part of building a dam!
But we can't get supplies through because of Diglett!
Hmm. That is a problem.
We even created a special division
for developing strategies to fight off the Diglett.
We're calling for any able Pokemon trainer who's traveling through the area,
somebody with real Pokemon know-how who can help us get rid of these Diglett.
The reward's a six-night, seven-day stay at the famous Giva Hot Springs Resort.
If you know any Pok-
We're three able Pokemon trainers at your service.
Oh, so you're the first squad of the trainers we called in!
Uh, well, we weren't exactly called in.
The first Pokemon trainers have arrived.
The rest are in these buses.
-It's Gary. -Huh? Who are...
Well, if it isn't little Ash from Pallet. What are you doing here?
It must just be an unlucky coincidence.
Only the best were invited,
like me, Gary from the town of Pallet, the number one trainer.
-Ash is fourth. -I'm fourth? I'm better than that.
You're the fourth to leave home, but as a trainer, you're dead last.
Aw!
Now watch as I step up to the plate and hit a Pokemon grand slam!
Hooray, hooray!
-He's very... -Detestable.
So, Ash, have you picked up any good Pokemon?
-Of course I have. Do you want to see? -No, thanks, Ash.
Only amateurs show off their Pokemon.
If I were going to show something off, it'd be my personal fan club.
Gary Oak, Gary Oak He comes through when others choke
Are they Pokemon?
Don't be dumb.
-So who are the girls? -Oh, they're just my friends of mine.
They're nice friends.
How would you lovely young ladies like to get together with me sometime?
Yes, sir. That would be fine.
Yes, sir?
Brock's over-the-hill already.
Okay, so they think I'm an old man, but I don't care, I'm desperate.
Could I have somebody's phone number, please?
Maybe an address? E-mail?
Can we please get back to the business at hand?
Somebody's got to get rid of these Diglett.
Don't forget: a resort vacation.
Don't give it another thought, sir.
Those Diglett are as good as gone now that Gary Oak is on the case.
So long, losers!
What about those phone numbers?
We're losers? I can't let him beat me. I can't.
We're Pokemon trainers, aren't we? Why don't we try to win that reward?
That's a brilliant idea, Jessie.
If we get rid of the Diglett, we spend a week at that hot spring resort.
I could use a rest.
I could use a little relaxation myself, Jessie.
I'll get rid of those Digglet.
Don't forget, James, we're a team.
You're right. I almost forgot that.
And our team is Team Rocket!
Hello. Uh, I wonder if it's possible to get traded to a less embarrassing team.
-It sounds like those... -Aliens are back.
We greatly appreciate all of you talented Pokemon trainers
interrupting your training to come here and help us get rid of the Diglett.
Mm, there sure are a lot of people here.
You, with the Pikachu on your head,
listen with your ears, not with your mouth!
You'd think the least he could do is yell at me by name.
Don't be mad. He doesn't know what your name is.
My name is Ash Ketchum, the loser from Pallet.
Don't listen to Gary. You can still catch up.
My name's Jessie. Look at all those punks.
Each outfit is more dreadful than the last.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Jessie, there's no need to be catty.
-What's wrong with catty? -I just thought of something.
With this many trainers, imagine how many Pokemon they must have.
Let's see. If each of them has six, there'd be six times that many Pokemon.
You can do the math, I just want to grab all those Pokemon.
It's a Pokemon bonanza.
All we have to do is...
Forget it. Let's just give up now.
James, what's the matter? What's wrong?
How can we possibly defeat all those Pokemon
-when all we've got are... -Ekans.
And Koffing.
-Ekans. -Koffing.
Another sneak attack.
They've never worked in the past, have they?
-No. -How about plan B?
You know what this would mean?
-Let's try it. -It's the...
Principle of induced evolution.
-Ekans. -Koffing.
Pokemon trainers, here you see Diglett,
the greatest parasitic bug Pokemon of the century.
Just a minute. Technically Diglett is not a bug Pokemon.
As a matter of fact, the term mole Pokemon would be more appropriate.
With a height of eight inches and a weight of two pounds,
they're hardly candidates to be called the greatest anything of this century.
That showoff thinks he knows everything.
They may seem to be weak, but together, they can destroy.
It's the Diglett! It's the Diglett!
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig...
-Diglett. Diglett. -I'll take care of this.
J Gary doesn't dig the Digletts Oh, no... J
Now everyone will be able to see the top Pokemon trainer in action.
This should do the trick.
Hey, what?
-It won't come out. What's wrong? -Pikachu.
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
-Diglett! -Oh, thanks.
Wait! This can't happen!
Okay, I can take care of this. I'll just bring out my best Pokemon.
-You can handle it. -J Let's go J
Go get'em!
What's going on here?
All right. I'll show them. I'll use every Pokemon I have.
Please, somebody stop them! Stop the Diglett!
-All right, go! -Go, Zubat!
- - Haunter, go!
- Magikarp, go! - Vileplume, go!
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig...
-Uh, thanks. -Thank you.
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
Thank you.
-At least they're polite. -Yeah and unstoppable.
Ha! All right. Now it's my turn.
As long as they're underground, I'm going to use Squirtle.
-I choose you! -Pika!
I can't stop now!
It almost came out.
-They won't come out. -Huh?
For some reason, the Pokemon don't want to battle the Diglett.
-Why wouldn't they battle? -I just can't figure it out.
-Is that right, Pikachu? -Pikachu.
You won't get away with this! Go away!
That won't work.
Diglett can pull their heads in at 186 282 miles per second.
-What's that? -The speed of light.
Diglett aren't very strong, but they can move super-fast.
Wow. You've been studying, huh?
Yeah, I've been studying, unlike you.
Well, that's it. I'm gone.
Look, since no one's Pokemon will come out and battle,
there's no reason for any trainers to be here
unless they want to watch this arcade game.
I, on the other hand,
must continue my journey to become a Pokemon master.
-Hasta la vista, Poke people. - Bye-bye!
Come on, fans, get in the car, and let's hit the road, shall we?
Good luck!
Aah! I don't like him.
Girls, those numbers?
Ah, there's nothing like a hot bath.
-But something doesn't feel quite right. -Don't complain.
We got into this place for free, didn't we?
-No, it's not that. -Then what's wrong?
I can't understand why the Pokemon wouldn't come out of their Poke Balls.
-Oh, yeah. Why was that, Pikachu? -Pika. Pika.
Diglett!
Diglett.
Ash, shouldn't we put some clothes on first?
Hey, Pikachu.
Pika, pika, pika.
I'll get you! I'll get you!
Koffing!
Some principle of induced evolution.
It says here, Pokemon need to have a certain degree of experience points
before they can successfully evolve.
Our experience is nothing but losing.
But here's something to think about.
When they finally do evolve, Pokemon become entirely different Pokemon.
-Ekans. -We've known Ekans for so long.
- Koffing too. -Koffing.
How could we ever...
Evolve them?
-Look! -Was it...
Something we said?
It could be.
They're evolving for us.
Their time to evolve just happens to be now.
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig...
Oh.
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig...
Trio, trio, trio.
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
Trio, trio, trio.
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
-Trio, trio, trio. -Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
Pikachu.
-Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig. -Trio, trio, trio.
-Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig. -Trio, trio, trio.
Dugtrio. The evolved form of Diglett.
No specific information available.
Oh, now I get it. This must be Diglett and Dugtrio's home.
-Their home? -Yeah, they work and live here together.
Diglett plows the ground and Dugtrio plants the trees.
And not just here.
This whole mountain range is their backyard.
-Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig. -Trio, trio, trio.
Diglett, dig, Diglett...
- All of these mountains? - Yeah. Maybe.
Probably all the forests in the whole entire world are-
Beautiful gardens made by these little guys.
And if we complete the dam,
this whole mountain forest would be completely covered with water.
Pidgey!
Rattata!
Then nothing could live here.
All of our Pokemon realized that before we did.
That's why none of them would leave their Poke Balls,
even when their masters ordered them to.
I guess we humans still have a lot to learn
from the ways of the Pokemon, right, Ash?
-I guess so, huh, Pikachu? -Pikachu.
This project's canceled. I won't build the dam.
-Trio, trio, trio. -Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
-Trio, trio, trio. -Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
Trio, trio, trio.
Well, I think I learned my lesson, Pikachu.
Your lesson is just beginning. -Aah!
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above...
-! -Jessie.
James.
-They know the rest. -
Oh, Team Rocket. I forgot about them.
Sorry, guys, but we're not in the mood for you right now, okay?
But we're in a good enough mood for everyone.
Yes, and we never even had lunch.
But now we have a special treat for all of you.
A treat with a sensational and exciting new flavor.
For the first time on TV.
- We're proud to present... - Our new Pokemon.
Our Ekans has evolved into Arbok!
Arbok!
And Koffing is now Weezing!
Weezing!
Arbok! Maximum power!
Arbok!
-Ah, we can handle this, right? -Pi.
-Charmander! -Charmander!
- Squirtle! -Squirtle!
- Bulbasaur! -Bulbasaur!
-Everyone, go! -Weezing, smog!
Weezing!
Pikachu, use your thunderbolt!
Pikachu!
Arbok! Dive underground!
-Ar! - Weezing, follow it!
- Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig. - Trio, trio, trio.
-Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig. -Trio, trio, trio.
Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig.
Trio, trio, trio. Huh?
What happened?
-I know what's coming. -Me too.
-Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig. -Trio, trio, trio.
-Diglett, dig, Diglett, dig. -Trio, trio, trio.
-We're surfing. -Yes, we're curling the shoot.
Cat-a-bunga!
Hang ten, baby, yeah!
-Hey, what's that thing up ahead? - Huh?
-The dam! -Maybe it won't hold!
It looks like Team Rocket's busted up again!
Gee, those guys never seem to catch a break, do they?
And they never learn their lesson.
Not like me. I definitely learned my lesson.
So our stay wasn't a waste after all.
That's right. And we're in luck.
-Fuchsia Gym's just over those mountains. -Mm-hm.
Ooh!
Construction of the Giva dam canceled.
And so the Diglett and Dugtrio were left in peace,
and everybody learned that when you do a little digging,
you can find something good wherever you look.
And now it's on to the next Pokemon adventure.
Okay, guys, we gotta rap some Pokemon.
You just do the singing. I'll take care of the hard part.
Let's get it on!
