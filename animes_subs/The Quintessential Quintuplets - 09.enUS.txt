Uesugi-san!
Y-Yotsuba!
Tomorrow is finally the day.
For what?
What else would it be?
This!
School Camp
School camp!
Have you read the leaflet?
I haven't.
It's full of fun events.
Outdoor cooking, skiing, fishing, hiking,
and then... the campfire!
And its dance of legend!
I heard there are a lot of people who start dating because of it.
I told you, relationships between students are a waste of time.
B-But wouldn't you want to date someone you have feelings for?
Right, Miku?
Miku?
Why do we date people we like?
That's because you love the person so much, you can't help it.
You must have an idea what that's like, Miku.
I-I don't.
All right.
Now that we're all here, let's start studying.
Again?!
I have a shoot, so I'll pass.
Actually, I sent you a message about that.
I have to prepare for tomorrow, too.
Wait up!
Jeez...
Miku,
my class has a meeting about the school camp.
Can you do the usual deal again?
Okay.
The usual deal?
What is Miku up to?
Ichika?
Didn't she just leave?
No way...
M-Miku?!
She took Ichika's place!
The Quintessential Quintuplets
The Quintessential Quintuplets
The Quint es sen tial Quin tup lets
The Quintessential Quintuplets
Thanks for coming, Nakano-san.
Um...
Maeda-kun, was it?
Where are the others?
Sorry, I lied to get you to come here.
Huh?
P-Please dance with me at the campfire.
With me? Why?
W-Well, you know...
Because I like you.
Really?
Ichika's cute. I wonder if she gets it a lot.
Thanks.
I'll let you know later.
I want an answer now.
Nakano-san, please!
Tell a cheap lie, and you get hurt.
Um...
Well, you reap what you sow.
Huh?
You have a different vibe today, Nakano-san.
Is it your hair?
Weird...
Um...
You're a quintuplet, aren't you?
You and one of your four sisters...
haven't switched places or anything, right?
Ichika, there you are.
Your sisters were calling.
Go meet up with them.
Futaro...
Hey, who asked you to be here, punk?
Don't go thinking you get to call Nakano-san by her first name.
Give her some time to decide.
Think about how other people feel for once.
It's not very convincing when Futaro says that.
Who gave you the right to eavesdrop?
This ain't any of your business!
It is, technically.
Um...
What?
You bastard...
Calm down!
Get lost!
I've already promised to dance with him.
Wait, no...
You're lying!
You're way out of this guy's league!
Th-That's not true.
Futaro is...
Futaro is...
Cool and handsome.
A-Are you dating?
W-We're all over each other!
Let's go walk home together.
Yeah, whatever. Let's go with that.
Hold it!
If you're really dating, you could hold hands, couldn't you?
Or what? You can't do it?
That's definitely suspicious.
Now look here.
Not every couple works the same way.
Mi
Ichika!
This is, uh...
It's not that I wanted to hold hands again, but, uh...
This isn't our first time.
Damn it!
All right, fine.
Hey, I know this isn't a great time to ask,
but what made you want to confess to the person you like?
How could you ask me that, Nakano-san?
Sorry.
Well, you know...
Anyone who does it wants that person all to themselves.
That's what it boils down to.
You want that person all to yourself?
What the hell am I saying?
Oy!
You better not give Nakano-san any trouble.
She's giving me plenty of trouble right now.
Oh, come on.
Let's go, Futaro.
You don't need to cling to me.
I'm Ichika right now.
This is what she would do.
I'll be okay.
Really, though...
Are you sure it's a good idea to turn him down without asking her?
Ichika said work is her priority.
Still, what about the campfire?
There you are!
All right, let's go.
We're going to pick out clothes for Uesugi-san to wear at the school camp.
I'll go first.
I chose something really loud.
I can't help but think you're messing with me.
A hint of Japanese style would suit Futaro the best.
This is way more than a hint!
I've chosen a manly outfit for you.
What the hell is your idea of manliness?!
Nino's choosing really carefully.
She's serious.
Why aren't you all taking this seriously?!
Are you all sure about this?
The money...
This isn't for your sake.
It'd be a nuisance to have you hanging around us while dressed like a hobo.
But you know, picking out clothes and shopping with a guy...
It's kind of like a date, don't you think?
This is just a shopping run.
Students shouldn't be dating.
It's improper.
You sound like Uesugi-san.
Don't lump me with him!
We're no more than students and teacher.
We need to keep a certain distance.
I already keep one!
Uesugi-san!
Be sure you take a look through the leaflet.
Why should I?
You better show up!
Let's make some awesome memories!
Oh, right.
My phone...
Received calls
Dad Missed Dad Missed Dad Missed Dad Missed
Dad?
Raiha! Are you all right?
Onii-chan, I think I have a fever.
Sorry for bothering you while you were out.
You've always been frail. It's okay, I understand.
I bought some medicine and drinks.
Give me the medicine, then, please.
Okay.
Wipe down my sweat.
Okay.
Do my homework.
Yup.
You're really making me pamper you.
Thanks.
Dad says he'll be back as soon as he's done at work.
Okay.
Onii-chan, you have school camp starting tomorrow, right?
Yeah.
Can I ask you for one last thing?
Tell me lots of fun stories when you get home.
I'll be okay on my own.
Fine.
Get some sleep.
All right, line up, please.
Nakano.
Nakano Itsuki.
Yes?
Get in line!
Would you mind taking over the test of courage planning?
Raiha!
Are you alive?!
Futaro.
She's still sleeping, Dad.
Keep it down.
You've been taking care of her?
Wait, the bus for your school camping trip must've left already.
You think?
I cared so little, I totally forgot.
Now I can study to my heart's content for the next three days.
Futaro, you forgot something.
Sorry I couldn't get home sooner.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime event.
You could still make it, couldn't you?
The bus is gone anyway.
I don't mind not going.
I'm hungry.
Raiha.
What about your fever?
All better.
Thanks, Onii-chan.
I'm all right now.
Go to school camp.
I just said the bus is...
The bus has already left.
Itsuki?
Why...
I understand the situation.
H-Hey!
Pardon me.
I'm going to borrow Uesugi-kun.
Okay.
Where are we going, Itsuki?
Y-You guys...
Futaro.
You're late.
Over here!
What the hell took you so long?
About planning the test of courage...
I can't do it.
I'm afraid of ghosts.
You do it.
All right, fine.
I guess I'll go.
Okay, off we go!
Quintuplet Game
Quintuplet Game! Yay!
In this game, we assign each of us to the digits of a hand,
and try to guess whose finger it is we're hiding.
Who am I?
Nino.
I think Miku.
Yotsuba.
It's Nino.
Hey, no touching!
Don't touch me!
It's Nino.
Nice try.
It's Miku.
Why is your hand facing backwards?
Damn it.
Next.
I'm up.
You seem oddly pumped about this.
Other than your place, I haven't spent a night away from home since elementary school.
No one can stop me now!
Well, uh...
Too bad we've been stuck in traffic for more than an hour, huh?
This is a nice room.
It's a four-person room, though.
I'm not sharing a room with him.
They had a large group that came in without a reservation.
This was the only one that was available.
We have the car.
He had work, so he went home.
Oh, hey, there was a room in front of the inn.
He'd be dead by morning!
I'm sure he'll be fine.
No way!
He should be fine.
What's this?
Dear Onii-chan, I made a good luck charm to keep you safe on your trip. Have fun at school camp P.S. I'm expecting a gift in return. Raiha
I made a good luck charm to keep you safe on your trip.
Have fun at school camp.
Raiha.
I told you...
Yup, this is a good inn.
Let's stop complaining and enjoy ourselves!
Gather'round, girls.
Listen up. Be careful, all of you.
For what?
I mean, you know...
We're going to be sharing a room tonight.
Keep in mind, he's a guy.
That won't happen.
Let's do it.
D-Do what?
I brought cards.
Let's play.
Cards?
I-I haven't done that in a while.
What should we play?
Fan-Tan.
W-We're going to be okay, right?
We're students and teacher, after all.
That was an intense battle.
Yeah.
Want one?
Not right now.
Miku...
What you said about the campfire yesterday...
Are you sure I can take him?
Yeah.
I said it to get myself out of trouble, so I'm not going to complain.
Okay.
I guess Big Sis will have to take care of poor, lonely Futaro.
Keep someone all to myself?
I'm not going to do that.
We're five fifths, and together we are one.
Besides...
I'm not worried if it's Ichika.
Miku says it's all right, so I guess it is.
Holy crap!
I want to take it home in Tupperware.
Please don't.
The curry rice tomorrow is going to look really sad after this.
I look forward to your team's curry rice.
Shut up.
Speaking of which, I haven't looked at the camp schedule.
The main events on the second day will be orienteering,
outdoor cooking, and the test of courage at night.
The third day will have the optional mountain climb, skiing, fishing,
and the campfire at night.
Why do you have that memorized?
Oh, and according to some new information,
for the campfire legend to work,
you have to hold hands at the finale.
That again?
Legend?
Don't worry about it.
None of these girls have a dance partner anyway.
Right.
I'm supposed to be dancing with Ichika.
I don't believe in some hokey legend about people hooking up,
but what now?
Not that I care about something that stupid.
I don't think anyone asked Nino.
Oh, I see. You're bitter.
Hold on a second!
Oh hey, look.
Apparently, there's an outdoor bath here.
A relaxing upstream hot spring Kawakami Hot Spring Inn
It looks pretty good.
Wait, mixed bath?
What?!
So not only are we sharing a room with him, we're also sharing a bath?!
Absolutely not!
Why are you assuming we'd be bathing together?
You don't want to go in the bath with me, Nino? How offensive!
It's not like we haven't done it before.
Nino...
N-No!
Hey!
I'm just getting back at you.
That feels so good.
I read it as mixed bath, but it actually said hot-water-mixed bath.
It's been years since we took a bath together.
Have your boobs gotten bigger, Miku?
Come on. We're all the same.
There's something wrong with that guy today.
Maybe Uesugi-san doesn't travel very often.
It was like he'd just pulled an all-nighter.
In any case, his traveler's high makes him a threat.
The problem is that there's barely enough space in that small room for six futons.
Who's sleeping next to him?
I think you're overthinking it, Nino.
We're just friends, after all.
She's right.
Uesugi-san isn't like that.
So you're okay with being next to him, then?
Uesugi isn't like that, right?
So there's nothing to worry about.
Well, I'm not sure about that.
What about you, then, Nino?
Huh? Why me?
It's just that you'd probably punch him if you had to resist.
You don't mind, do you, Ichika?
Me, huh?
You're just friends, right?
Yeah.
Futaro-kun's a good friend.
Then, what's the problem?
Wait.
Let's make it fair.
Let's make it fair for all of us.
I see.
This is a good idea.
If no one wants to be...
Well, he probably wouldn't lay a finger on anyone...
At least, from Futaro's perspective.
Okay, here we go.
Uh...
Maybe we should get some sleep, too.
Yeah.
Futaro-kun?
Wh-Why?
Wait...
Everyone's all over the place.
I think this is the second time I've seen him asleep.
If this makes me lose my cool,
I can't say we're friends...
Or partners.
I'm perfectly fine, right?
Rise and shine, everyone.
Breakfast is at the...
No way.
Were they just...
Nakano?
If it isn't Nakano!
What are you doing here?
To think we all spent the night snowed in at the same inn...
I'm surprised we never ran into them.
What's wrong?
I-It's nothing.
I can't be certain because I didn't get a good look,
but was one of us...
From: Orita-san (agency president) On your studies Ichika-chan, Good work at the shoot. I was talking to the director the other day, and you seem to be really popular. Be ready for more work. By the way, going forward, I think it could be difficult for you to stay in a normal school, with all the constraints. You could get called in for a shoot, and filming could take longer and stuff. Studying is important, of course, but if you really want to become an actress, you might want to go to a school with more freedom. You could also take some time off, too.
Ichika-chan, in order to focus on your acting work,
you might want to consider taking time off of school.
Have you chosen someone for the campfire yet, Nino?
N-Not yet.
Nino has such high standards.
I guess.
If only I could meet someone like him...
Hey, have you heard about the campfire legend?
I have.
About it hooking people up, right?
You end up spending your life with them, I heard.
Uesugi-san, I'm going to make this trip an important page in your memories.
We're students and teacher.
Even if a student were to develop feelings for the teacher,
it's the duty of the teacher to guide them back onto the right path.
Uesugi-kun, I'm going to take this opportunity
to find out if you're really an apt tutor or not.
Next Time on The Quintessential Quintuplets
Quintuplet Trivia!
You're good at impersonating your sisters, Miku.
Try an Itsuki-chan impression.
I already know how this is going to go.
She's going to end up pigging out, isn't she?
Itsuki when she found out Futaro's our tutor.
Ack!
Ack!
I didn't see that coming!
