eye catch
You're the one who gives me my future
Even on a road without signs, I'll be fine, if we're together
On a journey that I can't see ahead of, while I was lost, I found it
That my place to be is next to you
When we quarrelled, I let go of your hand again and again
I want to pull close and hold it now
You're the one who gives me my future
If I'm beaten down by the rain of tears
I wanna hold you, call my name immediately
I'll go embrace you
I'll accept sadness and bluffing in my hands
Boy
I suddenly turned my back on you and ran away
Because you've been so gentle to many other girls
Boy, please chase after me
Because it won't be over after this
I can't say I'm sorry, sorry
Even though I believe you, my lips are pouting
I can't be cute, sorry
Catch me in the town where a drizzle is falling
Because I'll turn around and give you a make-up kiss
In your warm arms
Return of the Hero
Return of the Hero
Several days later
Next Time
The Rumoured Accepted Student
It is time to depart.
Okay.
Do not worry. I will protect you during the journey.
Come on, let's go.
Thank you.
Are you all right? Do you have motion sickness?
No, it's just...
This is the first time I'm venturing far away from home.
So I'm a bit anxious.
I see.
We'll travel much farther. Will you be okay?
To the Kingdom of Tristain, right?
Yes.
What about your family?
Were you living alone in that lonely place?
My mother...
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
It's okay.
I'm sure this is the work of fate, too.
I wanted to see the vast world.
Fate?
Speaking of which, the other Void wielder...
Don't tell me...
Rejected! Completely and utterly rejected!
Wow!
Oh, this is your first time here, right?
This is where Henrietta...
I mean, the Queen lives.
I see.
Reporting back, Ma'am!
I am glad you have returned safely.
I have been worried.
Princess...
Your words are too kind for me.
I'm delighted that you are well too, Saito-san.
The mark of Gandalfr...
So you have returned to being Louise's familiar.
Well, a lot happened...
Yes. It's pretty inconvenient when you don't have a familiar.
You don't have to say that!
Saito-san, will you accept the title of chevalier this time?
More importantly, Princess,
this is Tiffania, who we have been looking for.
Come on, present yourself.
O-Okay.
My name is Tiffania.
I am honoured to meet you.
You must be weary from your long journey.
I cannot see your face clearly.
The hat?
It's rude to wear one in front of Her Majesty.
T-There's a reason for it...
What reason?
It's been bothering me all the time...
Do you have something on your head or what?
I do not mind.
I-I'm sorry, I am...
An elf?
An elf!
So you were an elf!
U-Um... I wasn't planning to hide it...
It's scary, isn't it?
You are disgusted by an elf, aren't you?
It appears you have your own story to tell.
Would you mind telling us?
Okay.
I am... actually... a half-elf.
My deceased mother was an elf and the mistress of the Archduke of Albion.
The reason I lived secretly without being seen by anyone is because of my mother.
The Archduke of Albion?
I will not hate you for being an elf, Tiffania.
You saved Saito-san's life.
Please be at peace.
Here in Tristain, I shall be your support.
Your Majesty, thank you so much!
I don't know how I can show my gratitude.
You do not have to be so formal.
Now, shall we have some tea over there?
Good work, Agnes.
Did anything occur during the journey?
I did not wish to make you worry unnecessarily, so I did not report it,
but there was some trouble again.
What happened?
I'll tell her.
Actually, the woman from before...
The one called Sheffield who attacked you before?
Yes.
She threatened me and asked about the whereabouts of a second Void wielder.
A second one?
We believe the enemy knows something we don't.
That woman, Sheffield, is quite skilled.
It's too dangerous to just ignore her.
If she's that skilled, her name must be known.
It could also become a rumour among the royalty.
Agnes, be cautious from now on.
I shall also look into this.
Please tread carefully.
Thank you, Agnes.
By the way, Saito-san.
Yes?
You will accept the title of chevalier, will you not?
Yes!
Myoz...
Myozunitonirun, I want to see your face.
Yet another wielder, huh?
The pawns have begun to gather.
Did I make you wait?
No, I do not dislike waiting.
The incompetent king has no choice but to wait.
Such a joke...
I am terribly sorry.
I was unable to find the other wielder.
Do not rush it.
We will find them soon.
I'll leave it to you.
Such kind words...
Stand up, Myozunitonirun.
Yes, sir.
Now it is time for me to play a little game.
I must attend a conference.
Tristain, Gallia and Germania will try to acquire Albion.
Oh well.
I'll show to that avaricious bunch.
After all, I'm incompetent, so I shall just sleep and pass time.
Please summon me any time you need something.
I shall do my best to serve you.
Very well.
I've grown tired of Albion already.
You are certain that Sheffield said there is another wielder, right?
Yes. But I have no clue who she was talking about.
If it's as you said, there must be other wielders of the Void.
Tiffania, do you have any ideas?
Tiffania?
Y-Yes?
I don't know.
I don't really know much about the world...
What were you looking at?
A ring?
It has no stone set in it.
It's a memento from my mother.
When I saved Saito-san, the stone dissolved and vanished.
Awaken.
The power enshrined in this ring shall bring the lost life back to this world.
So huge!
Tiffania, I have no memory of what happened after I was surrounded by the enemy.
Why was I in the forest?
I shall tell you.
Saito, at that time your heart had stopped beating...
Oh no! I'll get embarrassed if you all listen so closely.
It wasn't really that big a deal.
Louise!
I transported my unconscious partner to Westwood.
I see.
I had no idea.
Well, yeah.
More importantly, thank the half-elf girl.
She was the one who used that magic ring without any regrets.
Is that so?
So you are pretty special,
having such a ring...
N-No, I just did the natural thing.
My deceased mother used to say that one should help people in need.
That's why...
Only nature magic can bring the dead back to life.
That power is a part of elf magic, isn't it?
Yes.
The fact that the blood of elves flows in your veins means you can use magic, right?
Something similar to Void magic...
We won't put up any resistance.
We elves do not desire conflict.
I can't.
It's very important.
I'm sorry.
Please let me rest a little.
Tiffania!
Wait, partner.
She's gone through a lot, too.
Leaving her alone is the best you can do at a time like this.
Wealth is such a futile thing in this world.
Extravagant banquets...
Gardens that please the eyes...
Music that pleases the ears...
They are all unnecessary in this world.
The music box of the Primogenitor.
The other Void wielder must have heard your melody.
Just like this.
That's a strange song.
Sorry, did I wake you up?
It's okay. I couldn't sleep anyway.
Can I sit next to you?
Sure.
Say, Tiffania.
It's hard to pronounce, isn't it?
Just call me Tiffa.
I see.
It's strange.
The moon I saw from the forest is the same as the one I see from this balcony.
Tiffa, um...
Did I drag you into something troublesome?
I've been alone since I started living in that little house in the forest four years ago.
I thought that I'd live alone like that forever.
Do you regret this?
Um... It was as if we forcefully dragged you out of there...
And I feel bad about that.
Sorry, Tiffa.
It's not your fault.
Besides, I wanted to see the world.
Really?
Yes.
I want to walk freely on this vast world.
I want to meet many people.
But I'm scared.
I don't know anything.
The truth is, I can use magic.
I found that out when my mother passed away and I was about to be taken away by the military.
That's why even remembering it is painful for me.
Is that so?
I have the magic power I inherited from my mother...
But I don't know if it's something good or bad.
I don't know that either, but it can't be something bad.
There must be some reason that you were born a half-elf and possess magical powers.
Just like how I came here from a distant world.
Another world?
Yes.
That's why I can understand how you feel.
Ask me if you need help.
You're the one who saved my life, after all.
Thank you, Saito-san. I'm glad to be friends with you.
T-Tiffa.
S-Saito!
A-Ah... er... sorry! Good night!
Does he hate me now?
Lower your head.
I, the Queen of Tristain, Henrietta,
bestow the title of knight upon you.
Do you pledge loyalty?
I do.
In the name of the Primogenitor, Brimir,
I name you chevalier.
You are now my knight.
Saito Chevalier de Hiraga-dono,
please support me.
Yes!
Do it.
Master, please excuse me.
Master?
W-Wait! Why is Saito your master now?
This is an order from Her Majesty the Queen.
N-No way!
Your Majesty!
Oh, I thought Siesta-san was appropriate for the position since they get along well.
T-That's okay, but...
No, thank you for being so considerate.
I'm very grateful as well!
With this, the formal ceremony is over.
I shall prepare dragons to transport you to the academy.
I must prepare for the conference...
Tiffania will stay here in the meantime.
She is my cousin, after all.
Cousin?
Cousin, you said?!
Right, Tiffania?
Yes...
I just found out.
I still can't believe it.
Her father is my uncle.
As the Archduke of Albion, he governs South Gotha.
The fact that we crossed paths must surely be because of Primogenitor Brimir's guidance.
But Tiffa...
Won't you be lonely in such a big place?
Why don't you come with us to the academy?
No thanks. Her Majesty offered that, too, but...
I declined her offer.
Why?
I'm a half-elf.
I still don't have the resolve to walk among the crowd of strangers.
Actually, I want to be with you, Saito-san...
But I'd definitely be a burden to you.
Don't worry about that, Tiffa.
I'll protect you with everything I've got!
Saito, you sure seem to care about her a lot.
I hope you remember that you're my familiar.
But protecting fragile maidens is the job of a knight.
A chevalier's duty is to assist Her Majesty the Queen.
Please don't fight because of me.
If he can really protect me, then I'll come to the acade -
No, you don't have to come.
Saito, we're going back to the academy.
Tiffa, cheer up!
Come to the academy as soon as you can.
We'll be waiting for you.
Please come soon.
Saito-san, Siesta-san, thank you so much.
I'm happy you made such good friends.
I think Louise will realize that sooner or later as well.
Do you think I'm mean?
That's not true!
I'll warn you since you saved Saito's life.
What can you do by marching into the academy with such feelings?
Are you planning to stay in the shadows?
You can't go on like that!
Louise-san.
There might be many hardships waiting for you,
but fate will not continue like that forever.
You have to stand up with your own power.
You got it?!
Yes.
If you got it, stop crying all the time.
And regarding Saito...
Thank you.
If you hadn't been there, Saito would...
I'm sorry for saying harsh things.
I-It's okay.
Saito Chevalier de Hiraga-dono.
When you return to the academy, you will be surprised.
Oh? What is it?
It is a secret.
Have a good day, Saito Chevalier de Hiraga-dono.
Um, Princess...
This makes me kind of nervous. Please call me Saito.
I don't know what to do if you treat me courteously like that.
Today is an exception.
I see...
Saito-san, everyone, please take care of yourselves.
Oh, I can see the academy.
It looks fun.
Hurrah! Saito Chevalier de Hiraga!
Hurrah!
What's this all about?
They're celebrating your elevation to chevalier.
The emergency call from the royal palace came early in the morning.
It said to celebrate in as lively a manner as possible.
Her Majesty insisted on it personally.
Celebrate?
So you don't know about the Order of Undine Knights?
Though we didn't know about it before this morning either.
Order of Undine Knights?
Congratulations, Saito!
That's the way to go!
I'm Reinard.
I'll take care of the knightly practices.
And I'm the captain.
Otherwise it'd be a lot of trouble.
H-Hey hold on.
I'm blanking out.
I've got no idea what's going on.
Oh, come on.
Just leave the complicated details alone for now, Saito.
Becoming a chevalier changed my opinion of you.
Well, I guess it's all right for me to praise you.
Her Majesty is bad at choosing people...
Indeed.
Well then, gentlemen of the Order of Undine Knights,
let's lift Vice-captain Saito on our shoulders for becoming a chevalier!
You guys! Stop messing around!
Saito! Saito!
Are you all right?
Hey!
What do you think you are doing to Her Highness, Princess Guldenhorf?!
Hurrah! The Queen!
Hurrah! The Undine!
Oh, and also... Hurrah! Vice-captain Saito!
Oh, and also? And... vice-captain?!
Sigh...
It's impossible.
But...
Practicing and practicing every damn day!
And ignoring your master and saying you want to protect that half-elf?!
Zero no Tsukaima. Princess no Rondo.
The Rumoured Accepted Student.
Just a little more and...
I won't forgive you if you look away.
Gandalfr, God's left hand...
The valiant shield of God.
Windalfr, God's right hand...
O God's gentle flute.
