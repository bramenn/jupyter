We humans are miserable creatures.
We reject what we fear.
We attack because we don't understand.
Human cowardice...
I know.
You're scared too...
Are you human or a Corpses?!
I'm neither!
I'm a Corpseless!
Ikoma, this side has been taken care of.
Hey... Ikoma?
Ikoma...
I'm a... Corpseless.
If you fully turn into a Corpse and lose what makes you human...
So you're saying Nameless can be saved with the white blood?
That's right.
It will be able to undo the black blood's effects.
But with only one left, you can only save either yourself or Nameless, not both.
Either way, you have to hurry.
It's only a matter of time before it takes your mind.
Wait for me, Nameless!
They brought the virus here!
Set them on fire!
Die! Die!
Stop immediately!
Ayame-sama!
Thank goodness you're okay!
They are not the Corpses.
Like we could believe that!
It's your duty to maintain order!
No.
Order exists to protect the people.
We must not aim our guns at the wrong people.
What we should eliminate...
We are going to escape from Diamond Citadel.
Please join us.
Why are you alive?
You tilled so many...
You can die too!
Yes.
We believe she'll make it to the castle tower in roughly 30 minutes.
I got it.
We'll meet on platform 13 to evacuate.
Understood.
It... can't be...
What should I...
Young Master.
Corpseless!
Don't let him near the castle tower!
Get out of my way!
I'm only here for Nameless and Biba!
Sahari-sama!
He may have the body of a Corpses...
Sahari-sama!
Stop the stray Corpseless!
In that case, it's only a matter of crushing him...
I will not allow you to interfere with our plans!
This is where you die!
Ikoma!
Ikoma.
Don't worry...
How dare you...
You killed too many!
After all that damage...
Ikoma...
Young Master.
The Corpses are spreading faster than we had anticipated.
Please take this if the worst should happen.
Is he the next one you want me to kill, commander?
No, you save our people.
Once this is all over...
What about you?
I must go...
A dying man...
Kurusu!
Kurusu!
I'm fine!
Go, Corpseless!
Nameless...
I have to be strong in order to live.
The weak part of me can never return.
Not anywhere...
Isn't that right...
Nameless...
I'm coming... to save you!
Nameless!
Ikoma?
I'm going to turn you back now!
Biba!
I've been waiting...
And I am here...
Get out of my way.
Biba!
Judging from your appearance... you must have used the black blood.
What is it you seek that you would sacrifice so much?
That's all!
Ikoma...
Biba...
Biba...
Kill you.
So you have found...
Nameless!
Are you there?!
Live...
Stop, brother!
What are you doing?
Get up, Ikoma.
As you can see, I am still standing!
Fight...
Nameless...
I told you to stop.
I wish you would listen to me sometimes... brother.
We are going to live even though we're weak.
We're going to make rice paddies together...
So... I'm sorry...
I see...
No.
I'm... Hozumi.
It's going to be okay!
There's enough room for everyone!
Don't panic!
We should be able to go there following line six.
There's no guarantee that the railway is intact.
But there has to be a path.
Biba would have left a railway for his escape.
Would you like me to tell you?
You're...!
Let's make a deal.
In exchange for telling you the escape route...
You must be joking!
Like we would ever accept that!
Let us cooperate.
Ayame-sama!
They are suffering as well.
Or else they would be using force to have us comply.
Thanks, princess.
I'll tell you something good for that.
The stray Corpseless and your loyal dog are both here.
Nameless. You have turned back.
Ikoma!
What are you?!
Ikoma!
Kurusu, he's going to be okay, isn't he?
I was able to turn back, so Ikoma should too!
Tell me, Ikoma.
What should I do?
I'll cut down a million Corpses if you ask me to.
Nameless -chan, can you hear me?
Kajika?
Kurusu, Ikoma can you hear me?
I'm talking to you from the Iron Fortress.
Signal is good.
Come meet us on platform 13.
We'll have the Iron Fortress head there now.
I always get stuck with these jobs.
Nameless -chan, we'll all be waiting for you there!
Let's go.
I still haven't gotten his answer yet.
Master key confirmed.
Ignite the boiler!
Nameless.
Please, launch the Iron Fortress!
Out of my way!
Nameless -chan was saying that she wanted to eat rice until she was full.
To make a word where that can happen.
Platform 13 is right up ahead.
There!
It's Nameless and the others!
Yukina-san!
Yes!
It's the Iron Fortress!
Nameless -chan, this way!
Everyone get ready to catch them!
Ikoma...
You go first.
I'm home!
Kurusu!
I have returned.
Get in!
Increasing speed.
Ikoma.
Hey, Ikoma!
Is he not waking up?
He's going to be fine!
Ikoma promised to turn me human again!
He hasn't done that yet!
Wake up!
Wake up, Ikoma!
Ikoma!
Ikoma!
Nameless -chan...
You're my shield, so you can't die!
Wake up! Wake up!
Ow...
Stop shaking me...
Ikoma!
What?
Nameless...
I'm supposed to say that to you.
Was this...
My brother did that?
Your body's fine?
Yup.
Oh, that's right.
Ikoma.
Here.
You forgot this.
I will remember that day
Losing myself
In steam
Countless mistakes are made
When I can't see anything ahead
You said
Ask your own burning blood
Answer my beat
Corpseless of the Koutetsujou
Stand up
And slam everything onto the ground
My soul is devoted to my friend
Burn your life
Change the world
Last Chapter
Iron Fortress
Koutetsujou
