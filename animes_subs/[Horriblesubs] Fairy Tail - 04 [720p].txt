The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
Last time on Fairy Tail!
The reward is 2,000,000 jewel.
Intruder spotted!
You're so annoying!
I won't give you the book!
I can't believe that Daybreak contained this sort of secret!
Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up!
What the heck kind of wizard is he?
Mommy, I can see fairies...
What a mess.
Guess I should go find Lucy.
Who were these guys, anyway?
An enemy of literature?
A sophisticated, cultured individual such as me, myself and I?
Anyone who's happy to have a collection of those freakish maids isn't cultured!
There is nothing to mock of my beautiful blond maids!
A treasure map?
A spot to hide valuables?
What kind of secret does this book hold?
Tell me!
Tell me or I'll snap your arms in two!
This girly doesn't get her situation!
I got Kemu Zaleon himself to write that book for me!
Therefore any secret in that book is mine!
Happy!
Nice one! Cool!
Why, you...
What's with this cat?
I'm Happy.
Anyway, get up here.
The water feels nice.
Uh, it's sewage water.
Dear Kaby!
The tables have turned!
If you let me have this book, I'll consider forgiving you.
I really want to smack you one, though.
A Celestial Wizard?
For a bookworm you sure misuse language!
The tables have turned implies that you have the upper hand!
But having one extra cat on your side isn't going to be able to defeat my Diver magic!
So that was magic?
And that means Everlue is also a wizard?
And hey, you smell.
It's written in this book!
A horrible adventure story with you as the main character, Everlue!
What's with that?
It's wonderful that I'm the main character.
But the story is crap!
For Kemu Zaleon, of all people, to write such rubbish!
It's a disgrace!
You forced him to write it! How conceited can you get?
Conceited?
I am a great man!
It is an honor for someone to labor to write my book!
You blackmailed him to write it!
Blackmail?
What about it?
It was his own fault for refusing me in the first place!
What do you mean?
I told him to write a book where I was the main character, but that idiot refused!
Write the book, or I'll revoke the citizenship for your entire family!
If you did that, they wouldn't be able to join the merchant of craftsman guilds!
Is the Count really that powerful?
I told you, I'm a great man!
And in the end he wrote it!
But I was annoyed by his first refusal, so I made him write it in prison!
I'm an author, he said!
A master craftsman! But I broke that pride and haughty attitude of his!
How dare you do such things just to satisfy your own desires!
You put him in solitary confinement for three years!
Do you have any idea what he must have felt?
For three years?
Perhaps he finally noticed how great I truly am?
No!
He was fighting that pride of yours!
If he didn't write it, his family would be in trouble.
But he couldn't allow himself, as an author, to write a book with you as the main character!
How do you know these things, you pest?
It's all written in this book!
Huh?
I read that book as well.
Kemu Zaleon never appears in it.
It's true that if you read it normally, it's a work that'd make any fan cry!
But you should know that Kemu Zaleon was originally a wizard!
He couldn't have...
He used up all his remaining strength, and cast a spell on this book.
So that was his scheme! When the spell ran out, it'd turn into a book defaming me?
H-How rude!
You have no imagination, have you?
It's true that this book contains everything about how it was written!
But the words that Kemu Zaleon left in this book were nothing so petty as that!
The real secret is something else!
What, what?
The real secret?
That's why I'm not going to let you have this book.
In fact, you never had a right to it in the first place!
Gate of the Giant Crab, I open thee!
Cancer!
Cancer!
It's a crab!
Make sure to end all your sentences with -kani!
You got to do it!
You're a crab after all!
Just trust me! Say you promise!
We need to concentrate now.
If you don't shut it, he'll pinch your paws.
Lucy, how would you like your hair done today...
Ebi?!
Could you take a look at the situation, please?
We're in a battle!
Beat up that bald old man!
Okay-ebi.
I thought it'd be like a straight jab, but go figure, it turned out to be a hook.
You can go home now.
How about you go home?
The real secret?
Could it be he wrote down the illegal underbelly of my various business enterprises?
I can't have that...
If she hands it over to the Council's inspection wizards...
That'd be the end of me!
Gate of the Maiden, I open thee!
Virgo!
The same kind of magic as Lucy!
You rang, Master?
Virgo, get that book!
No way! She's a Celestial Spirit?
Ebi.
What?
Natsu!
Why is he with Virgo?
How'd you...
After she started moving again, I went to get her and...
I don't have a clue!
Get her... You mean you grabbed her, right?
Lobby
He couldn't have come through the Spirit world with her, right?
Spirit World
Sewers
That's unbelievable!
Lucy, what should I do?
Do something about him!
Virgo, exterminate these pests!
Understood!
I'll blow you away!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
You pervy mole!
You can't run away digging any more holes!
A bit-part in a novel...
Ebi.
Sir, what do you think of this look-ebi?
Nice one, Crab!
Wait, -ebi?
Nice and flashy, Lucy!
You did us Fairy Tail wizards proud.
Aye!
But we ended up destroying things again.
Is this my fault?
And then...
The composition and style of this book is just awful.
There was no way I could image it having been written by Kemu Zaleon.
So?
So that's why I thought there was some secret.
What is the meaning of this?
I am quite sure I requested that you destroy it.
Destroying it is a simple task. You should be able to do it yourself, Mr. Kaby.
Then I will eliminate it!
I don't even want to look at it!
I know why you can't allow this book to exist.
It's to protect your father's honor.
You're Kemu Zaleon's son, aren't you?
Why do you know that?
Have you read this book?
No. I couldn't bring myself to read it.
It's trash. My father said so.
So that's why you wanted to burn it?
That's right.
Burn it just cause it's dumb?
Isn't that going too far, man?!
Your dad wrote that book!
Natsu wait! It's to protect his honor.
Correct.
I'm ashamed that my father wrote Daybreak.
31 years ago...
Father!
Sorry I'm late.
You didn't contact us for three years!
Where in the world were you writing?
I'm through. I quit being an author.
What...
I'm never writing another book!
And then...
You're a fool.
Didn't I tell you three years ago?
I told you that you'd regret taking that commission for such a worthless book!
The money was good.
How could you?
I finished that incredible piece of rubbish.
Why are you smiling?
Thanks to that tripe you neglected your family for three years!
Kaby, I was always thinking of you.
Then why didn't you write something decent and come straight home?
You abandoned your pride as an author and your family!
You were correct to quit being an author.
Someone with no pride like you isn't fit to be one.
Or a father.
My father died soon afterward.
And I've hated him... Hated him ever since.
But as the months and years went by, the hatred I felt turned into remorse.
And yet, my father is no longer in this world to apologize to.
So I felt the least I could do to atone was to destroy this last, worst book of his.
I wanted to rid the world of it for the sake of my father's good name.
My father would agree.
No, he wouldn't.
It's begun!
What's this?
Kemu Zaleon...
His real name was Zekua Melon!
He cast a spell on this book.
Magic?
Dear Kaby?
That's right! It's written to his beloved son, Kaby.
He cast a spell that rearranged the letters.
On the entire thing!
Pretty!
The reason he quit being an author is probably not because he wrote the most terrible book ever,
but because he wrote the most incredible one!
This incredible book is a letter to you, Mr. Kaby!
I was always thinking of you.
That's the true book that Kemu Zaleon left to you.
Father, thank you.
I cannot let this book be burned.
Guess we don't need that reward, then!
Aye!
The request was to destroy the book.
And we didn't complete it.
B-But, that's...
Yeah... I mean, it's such a kind offer, so why don't we take him up on it?
Greedy.
So much for all those cool things you said before.
That's different!
We don't want it, so that's that.
We do! I want it!
Let's go home.
You too, Melon. Go back to your real home.
I can't believe this!
Is it normal to just let 2,000,000 slide like that?
Taking money for a request that wasn't completed would damage Fairy Tail's good name.
Aye!
But we did such a good job! Why not?
And we're walking home?
Those people weren't even rich?
They said they just rented that house for appearances.
I would have taken the job even if they hadn't gone to all that trouble.
I wonder about that.
Yes, I would have!
Probably.
Oh yeah, how did you notice the house wasn't theirs?
They smelled different than the house.
Anybody could have noticed that.
Aye.
Well, I'm not an animal.
But I really look up to a writer like that.
Just as I thought.
That thing you were hiding...
It's a novel you're writing, isn't it?
That's why you know all about books.
D-Don't tell a soul, okay?
Why not?
I-I'm still really bad!
I'd just die of embarrassment if someone read it!
Don't worry, no one will.
That doesn't exactly make me feel better.
Wait a sec, are you sure this is the way?
Happy said to go this way, so this is the way we go, says I.
How rude!
I'm a cat, obviously!
Cat's have an excellent sense of smell!
Isn't that dogs? And what does smell have to do with direction? she says.
Anyway, how about walking yourself, you lazy bum?
I'm tired, she says.
Sheesh...
Who are you?!
Is he looking for a fight? she says.
Go for it, Natsu!
It's Gray!
Why is he in his underwear? she says.
I was looking for a bathroom!
Why did you strip before you found one, jerk?
And there's no way there'd be a bathroom in the forest anyway!
And weren't you the one barging in when a guy's going to the bathroom, you bastard!
Exhibitionist!
What are they, in third grade?
Talking matchstick!
She says!
I see! You're coming back from a job.
Cutting through this forest is a shortcut back to Magnolia, see.
See? See, see?
You were bragging about your nose, but you didn't even realize Gray was there?
There are some things you don't want to smell.
What's that?!
Enough of you. Get on back already by yourself.
Of course.
It'll be trouble if I don't get back soon.
What kind of trouble?
Erza'll be back shortly.
Erza... You mean, her...
The woman known as the most powerful wizard in Fairy Tail!
Awesome! I want to meet her!
But I've never seen a picture of her in a magazine, so what kind of person is she?
Scary.
Wild animal?
Beast?
More like an evil demon!
She's not that big.
But she's bigger than you'd think!
It's about right if you're talking about how scary she is.
Actually, maybe it's even worse.
Like, this bad!
No, I think she could blow away a mountain into 3 pieces with a single kick!
Three pieces is exaggerating, I think it's more like two.
A woman that can blow a mountain in two with a single kick?
That's pretty scary.
Anyway, we've got to hurry home.
Crap, let's go!
A wizard?
Happy!
Aye...
We're gonna get us some protein for once!
I'm so sick of fruits and nuts!
Meat!
Looks delicious.
Man, this guy's shaking.
Sorry'bout this.
Guess you're scared'cause you'll end up in our bellies!
No.
I'm not shaking because I'm scared.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I might not be able to hold it in.
If that happens it'll make me taste weird, I'm sure.
Shut up. Do it!
Meat!
Medium, please.
I can't stand it! Are you sure about this? I'll taste weird!
Wait right there!
Happy!
Thank goodness!
I won't taste weird!
You're still going on about that?
You've got our friend there, bub.
You may be hungry, but we can't let you eat him.
You're also wizards, right?
From what guild?
None of your business!
Get'em!
Gray, let's do this.
Don't order me around.
Take this!
Sand Bomb!
Natsu!
Leave him!
Take care of Happy!
R-Right!
Oh, no! I'm going to be eaten by Lucy!
Shut up, cat.
Meat!
Meat!
Who's next?!
You'll get an unexpected visitor.
The stars point to trouble with water and women.
Fortune telling?
Shut it!
He's not even using magic?
Wow!
Uh, your clothes...
Whoa!
What is that guy?
Uh, oh!
Look here, you.
How dare you make my mouth all gritty!
Take this!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
You don't have to get serious against these small fry.
How about I fry up that smart mouth of yours?
I doubt you could. Not with those lukewarm flames of yours.
Oh, yeah?
Baggy pants!
Lulla...
Ill-tempered!
Huh, what?
Sourpuss!
Hothead!
The lulla... by...
Huh?
Lullaby?
Watch out!
What was that?
Who is it?
I can't sense them anymore already.
It's someone crazy fast.
Damn it! I don't get this at all!
Lullaby?
I did my best but it was all for nothing.
But it seems like they really appreciated it.
Just do your best for the reward in your next mission.
R-Right... That's right!
So then, what kind of outfit are you going to work in next?
I think she's got the wrong impression!
Next time: The Armored Wizard!
Look, I didn't wear it because it's my style, it was...
After doing the maid thing, then it's a bunny girl or swimsuit next usually...
Listen to people when they're talking!
