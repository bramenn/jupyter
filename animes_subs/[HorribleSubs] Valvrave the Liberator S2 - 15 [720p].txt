Let me think, I suppose she was around 11 when she became humanity's first Kamitsuki.
You stay young when you turn into a Kamitsuki, don't you?
Only on the outside. The heart can also age, Highness.
Is that true, Renbo?
It's Renbokoji.
That's too long!
Your godmother's name is also Renbokoji.
I just call her Godmother.
Tell me, when did you and the others receive the Blessing?
Blessing?
At the time, we called it a curse.
This is Gustav-eins. JIOR dropship located.
Moderate damage to hull. No sign of Valvraves or passengers.
Repeating, moderate damage to hull. No sign of Valvraves or passengers.
At present, local army forces are setting up a dragnet.
A thorough search is being conducted, but they have not been located yet.
We're dealing with the Valvraves here. They're too much for regional forces to handle.
But sir, we may be on Earth, but we're the space navy. We don't have jurisdiction.
I understand that this is their turf. We'll simply offer helpful suggestions.
But sir...
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
I have to say, they picked an interesting spot to come down in.
Wow, Dorssia's a barren wasteland.
We came down out in the boonies, that's all. I'm just glad it's not snowing.
Our entry angle was just 0.2 degrees off, and we end up way out here...
We're done for. I can't believe we landed right in the middle of enemy territory.
It's no big deal. We're here to pound the crap out of Dorssia, anyway.
It sounds like this fool still doesn't understand what force reconnaissance means.
- What did you say?! - Get it into your head already!
We landed in the enemy's lap. We got no choice but to fight now, you know?
You've got a one-track mind.
Stop it, guys!
This is no time to be fighting among ourselves.
Right now, we have to think of a way to reach JIOR from here.
I wonder just how far away it is. You got a plan?
Um... L-elf is thinking of one. Probably.
We're turning to him again?
He's one of us now.
He's saved our lives on a bunch of occasions up until now, right?
Did I imagine it? But...
There was blood splatter, too.
Well, yeah, but...
I have faith in L-elf. We need him.
Here is the plan.
The objective of this operation is to procure a means of transport.
That's true. We abandoned the shuttle.
So where do we get this means of transport?
From the Dorssian army.
From the enemy?! Sure, a military transport would be able to carry the Valvraves, but still...
Yet another tall order.
But compared to a consumer product, its performance would be a lot better.
You make it sound easy, but how do we do it?
We send spies into the enemy ranks.
This team will be Saki Rukino and Akira Renbokoji.
Akira?!
Go outside? Me?
Akira Renbokoji. We need your skills.
I'm against it!
He's right! We can't send Akira-chan in undercover!
It would be cruel!
But not me?
Well, Rukkie, you're... You know.
Yeah, you're... You know.
It's because they don't feel protective about you.
Why Akira?
In terms of skill set, it would be difficult for anyone else.
Come out!
Stop it, Akira isn't ready to
I'll go.
Akira?
I'll tough it out.
Look, I'm happy that you want to do this for your big brother, Akira,
but don't push yourself.
Shoko-chan.
Do you think this will fool the Dorssians?
Cobbling together a bunch of spare parts to look like a Valvrave is crazy.
It'll work. L-elf said it just has to put doubt in their minds.
The goal is to buy time.
Oh, it is?
Miss Sashinami!
There's a call from the ARUS Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
From ARUS? Not Dorssia?
Yes. They say that the five Valvraves came down in Dorssian territory, not JIOR.
No way!
Reply from JIOR.
They want to know where their friends came down.
As we thought, they don't appear to have any means of contacting the Valvraves.
Although the dimensions and mass of the
Valvrave spotted at Module 77 match the Figaro Report,
the probability that it is a fake seems to be quite high.
Let's play along and pretend to be fooled by it.
Sir?
If there are other Valvraves at Module 77, it will probably put pressure on Dorssia.
That's true. We'll word it as the government confirming a civilian news organization scoop.
I'll have a draft prepared right away.
The Council of 101... The Magius... What plans are they setting in motion?
Sorry for the wait.
Huh? Where is she?
We're really taking her with us?
There isn't much time. We're leaving.
Through here?
I've already confirmed that this leads to the surface up ahead.
Already confirmed? You know this place?
Yes. I built this place.
Take a close look a the layout, everyone. Drill L-elf's plan into your heads.
The bombs go further inside.
It's the real thing...
Don't worry, they don't go off that easily.
That easily, he says...
Well, they can be triggered to go off really easily, though.
Which is it?!
Okay, I see what he's doing. He's cautious, that one.
Sorry, could you hand me a screwdriver?
Um, I just need a screwdriver...
You know, I didn't expect you to come with us, Marie.
I asked L-elf about it.
He said that you volunteered to come to Earth.
That's because I thought that if I came down to Earth, I might remember.
Remember what?
I heard that you were the one who proposed this operation, Haruto.
What made you decide to go to Earth?
There's a lot that I want to know.
In addition to the situation in JIOR?
About the Valvraves, about the reason for this war, and... about myself.
- Haru - Tokishima!
Food's ready!
Like they say, an army marches on its stomach.
People in the past had some good sayings.
For sure!
There's still some curry-flavored left.
Are you sure I can have it?
Of course!
I'm amazed that you found this path, Q-vier.
That's our runt!
Say, X. Can I shoot him?
Cut that out, idiot!
Q-vier, permission granted!
Permission acknowledged!
Damn it, cut it out!
Q-vier.
The sound of a gunshot would carry a long way here. Use a knife.
Don't encourage him!
Roger! A knife it is!
You actually pulled a knife!
Give me authorization, too.
Hey! Cut it out!
Is this... a village?
Yes. It hasn't changed at all since then.
Wow, people actually live in a place like this...
What is that?
The pride of the Dorssian army, the Ideal Blume mobile base weapon.
It establishes a bridgehead by making assault landings inside enemy lines.
It's a revolutionary weapon that made the Third Blitz War possible.
That's what attacked the JIOR mainland?
That's right.
Um... I forget, how do you say Hello?
It really hasn't changed, not one bit.
You must work for the Karlstein Agency.
Two of you? Perfect.
The Karlstein Agency.
It may look like a typical settlement, but it's actually a top-secret facility that trains Dorssian agents.
We were told to kill anyone suspicious.
Kill any informants. Kill any deserters.
Kill any witnesses.
Kill.
Kill.
I-I'm fine, so don't come out yet...
But... the blood...
Didn't you hear me? I'm fine.
If we didn't kill them, we would be killed.
I explained it back at the Moon, remember?
We Kamitsuki are indestructible. Wounds heal up in no time.
Really?
Yep, really.
H-Here.
Thanks.
Can you move?
Almost, give me a minute.
Hurry. We're proceeding to the next step right away.
Those kids, did you kill them?
No. We have use for them.
Saki Rukino. Akira Renbokoji. Body-jack these two and infiltrate the Dorssian army.
It's time. I'll go on ahead.
Stick to the plan.
Will do. I'll see you on the surface.
There should be a record of the monitor feed in the cockpit.
If I look at that, I'll know for sure if I was imagining things.
It's been a long time!
Marie, right? Right? Right?
How do you know my name?
I know you. Pino and Marie. Friends.
Friends? But you're
This isn't the real me. What's important is that you and I are friends. Starting 5 years ago.
Five years!
Yes! Friends! Friends!
Your goal is to lure the enemy force to this hill.
When they arrive at the hill, we collapse the ground beneath them using the bombs we planted.
Ah, we'll knock them down into that cave.
Akira Renbokoji.
Your job is to infiltrate the Dorssian army in all the confusion and hack the transport ship from the inside.
You aren't alone.
T-Th-Tha...
From oh-three-hundred last night until the present, did any of you detect anything out of the ordinary?
I observed unusual activity on the hill to the north.
Two boys, late teens. One girl.
Judging from the language two of them used, I believe them to be JIORan.
Just what I'd expect from a Karlstein boy.
You can lead us there, I take it? We'll head for the north hill at once.
Blitzendegen!
He took the bait!
Wait.
We'll go with you.
Hey, did one of them have silver hair?
These two are L-elf's old squadmates!
Begging your pardon, sirs...
We understand. We'll go strictly in the capacity of observers.
In the event of an engagement, command authority rests with you. I understand.
He has silver hair and a real nasty look in his eyes.
I don't believe he was there.
Too bad! Maybe they're students, then.
Most likely.
Those questions fall under our purview as well.
Fine, fine.
You remember me from 5 years ago? You've met me?
It's me! It's Pino!
You forgot? Don't remember?
I don't remember. My only memories are of the past two years.
Tell me. Do you know the old me?
Oh, I get it. It's because I ate Runes.
Ate? Absorbed? Sorry. My speaking is bad again.
Because they reset system.
What are you talking about? What are you? You aren't an OS?
Marie...
This body is amazing.
This is Renbokoji. We're in position.
Good. Commence operation.
Unit 3, do you copy?
Yeah!
Your objective is to destroy the Blume. Get going!
Roger that! I'm gonna do this with gusto!
Enemy attack!
From the sea?
It's started.
Man, the firepower on that thing!
If I fly, my temperature's gonna spike!
That's the Ideal Blume, the Dorssian army's most powerful weapon. However...
They had another one hidden, huh?
What the
The Blume's downward fire offers unparalleled power against land combat weapons with thin top armor plating,
but Unit 5 can focus all its defensive capabilities overhead.
It's not stopping? I can't believe this thing's defenses!
That's your cue, Familiar!
Goodbye, Ideal Blume. With the arrival of the Valvraves, you're already a weapon of the past.
We did it! Now Haruto is up.
Yeah, since we're going in turns. Wait, what?
Wasn't Haruto next? Did I get it wrong?
No, Haruto isn't here. L-elf?
Haruto Tokishima. What are you doing?
Marie. You... were talking with the Valvrave just now, weren't you?
Stop right there.
Haruto, what are you?
What are you talking about? I'm
I saw it. Your right eye was injured during reentry, and it healed.
Marie?
I know what I saw. When we got to Earth, your eye was healed.
Mission complete!
We did it! You and me were more than enough for the job!
Fighters? I've never seen that type before.
They all look the same after you shoot'em down.
Output, 20. Thermal emission values nominal.
Phase 3, clear. Proceeding to aircraft operational test phase 4.
I'm going to ask you one more time. Haruto, what are you?
Tell me.
I'm... not human.
Not human?
That's right.
Tell me everything. About this Valvrave, too.
When Dorssia came to Module 77, I was...
Marie!
Get into your Valvrave, Haruto Tokishima!
The battle has already begun.
Proceed according to plan.
L-elf!
Kirchbaums, proceeding to annihilation output.
Kirchbaums, you are cleared to proceed.
Be careful! We don't have any intel on these!
Makes no difference to me!
Yamada!
Why did you shoot Marie?!
If the secret of the Kamitsuki got out, this combat group would no longer be viable.
Don't give me that! Violence is your answer for everything!
That's impossible...
Next time, episode 16, Marie Set Free.
Valvrave the Liberator... The system that will expose the truth of the world.
