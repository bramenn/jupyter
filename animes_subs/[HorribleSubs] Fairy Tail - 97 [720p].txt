This feels great...
There's nothing like relaxing in your own home...
Nice place you got here.
Isn't it?
Maybe I should live here, too...
Lucy, you don't have any booze? Seriously?
This is my house!
Her name is Cana Alberona.
Among the members of her generation, she's been in Fairy Tail the longest.
What's wrong? You seem down...
Uh, it's nothing, really...
Do you usually take baths together?
Do you usually stroll into other people's houses?
Did you and your dad patch things up after that?
Uh, I'm not really sure...
I suppose you could say that.
Well, we haven't exactly kept in touch.
What?
If you're worried about something, I'll lend an ear...
I'm thinking of quitting the guild.
Best Partner.
Cheers!
And that's what happened, Mira-san!
Cana didn't even tell me why! What's up with her?
It's fine. Cana always says that around this time.
Around this time?
Pretty soon it'll be 6 months since I joined Fairy Tail.
I had no idea there was such a big event at the end of each year.
Work, work!
Aye, sir!
Hey! If you're going on a job, take me!
Sorry, but I'll be going alone for now!
We'll hang out with you when we get back!
Watch where you're running, you hothead!
And you're in my way, Fruit of the Gloom!
Do the two of you have time to be fighting?
You've got a point!
I'm back!
There's no time for that! This is my next job!
Got it. Have a nice day.
You're going right back out?
I'm going out on this job!
Okay. Have a nice day.
Work, work!
I'm going on this one!
And I'm on this one!
I totally had my eyes on that one first!
As if! The one who takes the flier gets the job!
Team Shadow Gear's on their own during this time!
What the hell is this?
You'll know pretty soon.
You can predict the future?
Yes. Remember what the Queen said?
I also have the power to see the future.
Now that I consciously realize it, I'm able to control it a little.
That's amazing, Carla!
So tell me, who will I marry in the future?
I can't see that far into the future.
Let me see...
For example... You see Macao over there?
Pretty soon Wakaba will come over and they'll start talking about the young people in the guild.
*gulp*
Yo, Macao.
Hey there!
Wow, he really came, Carla!
Shh! The real part comes now.
It's that time of year again, you know?
Sure brings back memories...
Back when we were younger...
We sure had that passion, you know?
But the young'uns these days are incredible!
Such fine asses!
You're the ass!
Oh, more a breast man, are we?
I got kids, buddy.
I don't go'round starin' at girls' rears!
What about their feet?
Man, could I take a bite out of...
Those could step on me any time!
W-Wow...
You were totally spot on!
The conversation was disgusting, however.
I'm sorry I went and predicted that...
Even so, that's amazing, Carla!
Yup, yup!
Anyway, I still can't control it perfectly.
H-Hey, that's dangerous-kina.
That's enough.
I can only stay in my original body for a short time, I see.
But you are really something. Your swordsmanship is superb.
Oh, hardly... I suppose I should say as expected from Erza.
How'bout that, Erza?
That's how awesome Lily is!
So this is the power of what they label S Class in this guild?
There are people who are working their butts off,
but there are people who are just doing the usual,
so I have no idea what exactly...
You'll know tomorrow.
Then, the next day.
Almost all of the guild members have assembled here at Fairy Tail.
What's all the commotion about?
Beats me.
I heard that the Master has an important announcement!
I'm not interested.
Finally! I'm so nervous...
We worked really hard, Al.
Don't worry.
Natsu, you can't even keep still!
This anticipation... That's a Man!
Finally, I'll know the secret!
Juvia's heart is aflutter...
How about you just go home?
Master!
We've been waiting!
Tell us already!
Tell us?
Tell us what-kina?
Fairy Tail! As we have done since days long past,
I will now announce the participants in this year's S Class Wizard Advancement Exam!
S Class Wizard Advancement Exam?!
I'm all fired up!
Everyone, quiet down!
The Master isn't finished speaking yet.
This year's exam will take place on Tenroujima!
Note: Tenroujima = Heaven Wolf Island
It is holy ground for our guild.
So, what kind of test is it?
It changes each year, actually.
But it's always something extremely hard.
I mean, anyone who passes gets to be an S Class wizard, after all!
Each of your powers, hearts, and souls...
I have judged them all this past year...
There will be eight participants!
Natsu Dragneel!
All right!
Good for you, Natsu!
Gray Fullbuster!
Finally, the time has come...
Juvia Lockser!
Huh? Juvia is participating?
Elfman!
Those who are Men, should become S Class!
Good luck, Elf-niichan!
Cana, Alberona!
Fried Justine!
To follow in Laxus's footsteps...
Levy McGarden!
Finally, I...
Levy's time has come!
Mest Gryder!
Mest!
He came close last year...
This year's no good, either?
There's always next year, right?
Natsu's finally in this year.
So is Gray!
This is gonna be good.
Everyone looks rarin' to go!
Wow! S Class wizards, huh?
One day, I'll also...
I see... So everyone was trying their best so they'd get chosen.
Do your best, everyone!
Huh?
Oh yeah... Could this be the reason she wants to quit the guild?
This time, only one of you will pass.
The exam will take place in a week,
so each of you, prepare yourselves!
Just one-kina?
Is the frontrunner Fried?
Mest, obviously.
Natsu and Gray are there, too!
W-Why aren't I included?
Even Juvia is, so...
I've heard about your reputation in the guild.
Doesn't seem like you're trusted.
Uh, no! I mean, I can't tell you why, but I'm not!
I wanna explain but I can't!
And there's also Erza...
You're not ready.
Damn you!
Honestly... Such a fuss all the time.
What's the matter, Carla?
N-Nothing...
What was that, just for a moment...
Who?
I didn't know yet.
An unexpected something would be joining in for this event...
As this is the first time for some of you, let me explain the rules.
Each of the eight selected participants, please select a partner within the week of preparation.
Partner?
It's a contest between two-person teams.
This exam tests your bonds with your friends.
There are two rules for the partners you can choose.
One: They must be a member of Fairy Tail.
Two: You cannot partner with S Class wizards.
In other words, you can't form a team with Erza, Mirajane, or Gildarts.
Being with Erza-san would make you far too powerful, after all.
The contents of the exam itself will be announced once you arrive at Tenroujima.
But this time, Erza will be blocking your progress.
I'll also help out to get in your way!
D-Don't tell me... You can't become S Class without defeating Erza and Mira-san?!
Well, I'm sure they'll hold back a little, but...
Now you see what I meant by hard?
No complaining!
All S Class wizards have gone through the same path...
H-Hold on a second...
Don't tell me...
You're gonna participate too, Gildarts?!
Don't be happy about that!
The eight selected participants and their chosen partners will assemble at Hargeon Port in one week.
That is all!
This year's gonna be tougher than ever.
I'm surprised that it's the first time for all of you.
I'm fired up!
I'm gonna become S Class for sure!
The path to becoming S Class just got farther away for Elfman the Man!
Everyone seems to be having a rough time.
Good luck, everyone!
Let's do our best.
Leave it to me!
I'm sure Laxus would be pleased if he comes back to see you've become an S Class wizard.
And the rank of the Raijinshuu will shoot up!
So Fried's partner is going to be Bickslow...
They seem like a powerful team, sure.
She seems skeptical!
So then, has everyone decided on their partners?
I'm partnering with Happy, of course.
Aye!
Happy?! That's not fair!
If the exam is a race, then flying would make it a breeze!
What's wrong with that?
I don't mind, myself.
Because if it comes down to fighting, you'll be in trouble.
Gray, that's just mean.
I'm gonna make Natsu an S Class wizard, for sure!
I'm not holding back, even on my friends.
And so...
Time to train!
Aye, sir!
So in the two years I've been gone, Natsu's good enough to take the S Class exam, huh?
Natsu thinks that he'll be able to meet Igneel if he becomes a great wizard.
He feels twice as strong about this exam as most people.
I see.
Good luck, Natsu!
Um... Juvia would like to withdraw from this exam...
Why?
Because...
What was that?
Because, Juvia...
She says she wants to be your partner.
See?! You're totally gunning for him, Lucy!
No, I'm not!
Gray-sama... Are you planning on partnering with Lucy?!
Sorry, but I've already decided on my partner.
Long time no see, everyone.
Hold on!
Loke?
We promised a year ago.
Lucy... Sorry, but I'll be lifting our contract during the period of the exam.
There's no need to worry.
I traveled through the gate with my own magic power.
So I won't use up your magic power.
What...
What a free Spirit, indeed!
It's trainin' time, hooboy!
Hooboy!
Um, but...
What should we do?
Snow's falling, so it's gotta be that!
Yeah, that!
Stop giant boulders with your body, and build up that defensive strength!
Hold on a sec!
But are you technically a member of the guild, Loke?
I am still a Fairy Tail wizard.
With pride in my guild, I will make Gray an S Class wizard.
I'm countin' on ya!
Leave it to me.
Were those two always so close?
And there you go. You'd better give me your best shot.
Let's have a passionate battle, just like old times!
Passionate...
A passionate battle...
Um, Ma'am...
I'll partner with Juvia.
You're serious, Lisanna?!
I got along great with Edolas's Juvia.
And the Juvia over here is kind of cute!
Lisanna-san...
It's decided!
Don't tell me... She's also after Gray-sama...
How obsessed can you get?!
Wait, Lisanna!
Then what will I do for my partner?!
Oh? But you've been getting a passionate stare down for a while now...
Looks like she's pissed that Fried chose Bickslow as his partner.
Evergreen?
Elf-niichan?
Passionate stare? More like one that turns you to stone...
And then...
Special Training Regimen 15: Increase your lower leg strength!
Natsu, are you okay?
I'm not done yet!
Special Training Regimen 16!
I'll be heading to Tenroujima first.
I'll be waiting for you, Natsu.
I'll blow away Erza, and Mira, and Gildarts...
Aye, sir!
Levy was chosen!
Amazing! You might become an S class wizard.
So, you'll be partnering with me, of course, right?
Don't be silly, she's partnering with me!
I'm the faster runner!
My magic is suited for battle!
Anyway, you just want to be together with Levy!
Same for you!
If you really wanna be an S Class wizard, then I'll lend you a hand.
Gajeel!
I just have to blow away any guys who get in your way, right?
But I've got a small body, and I'm not really good for anything...
I might lose right away.
Don't go sounding so weak before it's even started, man!
Hey! Let me down!
I'm gonna make you big time.
What's wrong, Carla?
You've been quiet ever since this morning.
It's just... I have a bad feeling about this.
About this exam.
Don't participate, no matter what.
There's no one for me to partner with, so no worries.
I wouldn't be so sure of that, Sky Maiden.
Um... And you are?
I am Mest.
Mystogan's apprentice.
Natsu, dinner's ready!
What's wrong, Natsu?
My chance has finally come around.
I'm gonna become S Class, no matter what.
Aye!
Snow! It snows in Magnolia, too!
That's no place to be dead drunk!
Man, what a lifesaver you are.
If no one had noticed me, I would've been a goner there.
Sheesh... You've been acting weird, Cana.
I'm sure you heard from Mira.
I've got this complex about the S Class Exam, or something like that.
Does this have something to do with you saying you wanted to quit the guild?
This'll be the fifth time.
I've failed the test 4 times... I'm a wizard who didn't live up to expectations.
Oh, is that it?
What does it matter how many times you fail?
I'm the first ever to fail four times.
So, I'm going to make this the last.
If I don't become S Class after this, I'm leaving Fairy Tail.
Hey... You don't have to be so hung up over being S Class...
I have to become S Class!
I have to...
And there you have it.
If I don't become S Class this time...
I've made up my mind.
I'll be your partner, Cana!
There's no way I'll let you quit the guild!
Because I'll make you an S Class wizard, Cana!
Lucy...
Then, one week later, at Hargeon Port...
Each with their own feelings in their chests, the day of the S Class Advancement Exam has come.
What's with the creepy face?
Wanna know?
Actually, I'm not that intere-
You see, my horoscope said that today I have the best luck in love!
Cana told me my fortune!
So if I show everyone how awesome I am during the exam, then Carla will...
Next time: Who's the One with the Good Luck?
For your information, Carla isn't participating in the exam.
No!!
Waste of luck, Happy.
