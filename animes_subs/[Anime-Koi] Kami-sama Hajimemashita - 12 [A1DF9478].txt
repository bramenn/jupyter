The skies are clear, and she has not a care on her mind.
She's going into town to buy a few things.
Let's see...
A toothbrush, sponges, and duct tape.
Hey, someone's coming.
It came out!
Run away!
What's with them?
Yeah, seriously.
They were so rude.
You know that abandoned shrine at the top of the hill?
The one that's supposed to have all those paranormal phenomena, right?
Yeah, the ghost shrine.
I heard that the ghost of a girl appeared not too long ago.
Oh my, that's frightening.
I agree.
I told my children to not go near it.
I don't know what I'd do if something were to happen to them.
The...
The shrine isn't a scary place!
I know it's not exactly extravagant,
but Tomoe still cleans the place every day!
It's far from abandoned!
Oh, is that so?
Tomoe?
We apologize, then.
A haunted shrine...
They think it's haunted now.
I see. That's why people don't come to the shrine.
I hadn't realized that people thought it was haunted.
What's up, Nanami?
Tomoe.
Aren't you supposed to be out shopping?
And what are you doing up there?
Well...
A bird got stuck in one of the branches,
and I felt like helping it out.
I need to do something about this.
That's it!
We're going to throw a fall festival!
People will definitely come to the shrine,
and everyone will realize that it's not abandoned!
That sounds fun!
One vote for you!
Sounds stupid.
I don't want to have anything to do with events that attract visitors.
Oh, the memories!
We held a special event like this once before.
What a mess.
Mikage-sama told us not to touch anything.
Isn't that a portable shrine?
Heave
Oh no!
Something just
Nanami-sama, you mustn't touch that!
Sorry.
I wonder what it looks like!
I can fix that!
First, I'll scrub it clean!
Maybe that will make it look better.
What does she think she's doing with that old piece of junk?
And what do you think you're doing?
You could just help her if you're worried.
Honestly, I'm surprised that you still refuse to see Nanami-chan as anything but a human.
All I see is a deity.
She's the only one who still sees herself as a mere human.
It looks much better now.
Thank you for your hard work.
Tomoe!
Look at my portable shrine!
A portable shrine is a place for a deity to live.
Someone with an actual body like you can't live in it.
I don't think you have what it takes to throw a festival.
Why don't you just give it a rest?
No, not yet!
For the time being, let's set aside the portable shrine.
Is there anything I can use in here?
Good grief, you never learn.
It's not as if the disappearance of worshippers is a recent thing.
The shrine has always been like this, even before you took over.
Just because you're the Earth Deity now, it doesn't mean you have to let it bother you.
I want people to come and pray at the altar you work so hard to maintain.
The main building is free of dust.
The offering box doesn't have a single piece of trash in it.
I want everyone to see that.
And I know that I can't do anything that a deity is capable of,
but I can at least do my best as a perso
You still haven't realized it?
The air is so clean because you are here.
Abandoned shrines are magnets for miasma.
That's something even I can't cleanse.
Remember how the place looked when you first arrived?
Don't you think it's become more beautiful since then?
Still, I don't want people to keep thinking that our shrine is abandoned and creepy.
I'm done!
All right.
I'm from Mikage Shrine.
We're throwing a festival soon, so please come by.
Here.
No way!
Isn't that shrine abandoned?
It's not.
It's actually a quite charming and pleasant place.
Let's go!
Please come by!
We'll be waiting.
A mortal deity is holding a special event, huh?
So, we have one week until the festival.
I'm open to suggestions on what to do if you have any.
I have one.
How about we get a whole bunch of sake,
and give it to everybody?
And where do you think we'll find that much?
You know, I don't like it when you put down others' ideas without suggesting your own!
Okay.
We should catch demons and put them on display.
What now?
Both of their plans lack any common sense.
You need a permit from the Department of Health to hand out food at a festival.
You should call off the festival.
And speaking of,
have you considered a more traditional festival?
One with a kagura dance and drawing fortunes.
A kagura dance?
Drawing fortunes?
That's a great idea!
You're awesome, Kurama!
Why are you here?!
Because I received a letter from Nanami.
She was apprehensive about letting you guys handle this on your own.
Here, a present from me.
Sweet Potato Love
The famous Sweet Potato Love.
Kurama, thank you!
We put on a kagura dance once before in the past.
Huh?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think you could handle it.
It's beautiful.
You can wear it over what you have on.
Wanna try it on?
Are you sure?
You look great in it.
Really?
I'm sure everything will turn out fine now that I have shrine guardian's seal of approval!
I guess so.
We're going to make sure you know this dance before the festival.
I won't go easy on you.
You'd better be ready.
I'll try my best.
Do Not Remove From Room
Right. Left.
Forward. Left.
Right.
You're raising your hand too high.
Slow down.
Yes, now turn right.
That was backwards!
How many times do I have to explain it to make you remember?
We have less than a week until your performance!
Do you think we have the luxury of taking it slow?
You're going too fast.
I'm not going too fast.
Your memory just sucks.
How long are you going to keep sitting around? Let's get back to practice.
Nine parts?
I don't think anyone's going to stick around that long.
No, Nanami-sama!
It's a deity job to cleanse the bad aura.
This is to commemorate the return of celebrations to our shrine...
so please do it completely and perfectly!
I think I'd do better with some music.
If you want music...
We have music?
Mizuki is practicing now.
He can't even produce a sound yet!
Zip it, and get back to practice!
We don't have a second to waste!
Y-Yes, sir!
My movements shouldn't be that bad,
but I always freeze up in front of him.
Your arm is too high.
Ow, ow, ow!
Morning.
Today, we're practicing until the fifth part.
No! You Spartan fox!
Your hand is too high again.
Slow down.
Yes, now spin to the right.
That was backwards!
Stop making me point out the same mistakes!
Nanami-sama, hang in there!
What do you think you're doing?
Take a three-and-a-half minute break.
Nanami.
What is it now?
Aren't we on break?
Let me see your hands.
I know that you're nervous because you want the dance to be perfect,
but your nerves are precisely why you're messing up.
You should do this when you're feeling nervous.
It's an old tradition passed down in this shrine.
Huh?
Swallow this.
How do you feel?
Relaxed yet?
Yeah.
It's called swallowing a human.
It's a charm to remind you that you're a deity.
You'll do a lot better now.
Thank you!
But I've done this many times when I was little.
Break's over!
Yes, sir!
Ouch!
Momozono Nanami, 17 years old.
A run-of-the-mill high school girl.
Intelligence, I give her a C. Physical strength, D. Spiritual power and luck are also both C's.
Not one redeeming quality. Just a mortal human.
Everything about her screams normal.
Why on earth would Mikage-kun choose her?
I just don't get it.
I've put her through so many trials, like the Narukami-hime affair.
Well, she passed those tests nonetheless.
Yet I can't shake off the feeling that she's unfit to be an Earth Deity.
Maybe Mikage-kun was mistaken after all.
I'll have you know that I was not.
Where'd you come from?!
You were here, Mikage-kun?
Yes, the whole time.
I picked her for a reason.
Now then, shall we get started with your final exam?
That's not how you do it!
Right, left, right, then spin.
Hmm? Something felt off about that.
Ow, ow, ow!
I can't even memorize the first part.
What am I doing?
Tomoe said that he believed in me.
Ow, ow, ow!
Ouch!
Not a surprise, coming from a girl who gets a paltry D for physical strength.
That was pretty clumsy.
Who are you?
You're a rude little girl.
You should introduce yourself first, you know.
Momozono Nanami-chan.
How do you know my name?
I'm here to test Mikage's successor.
I'll see whether you're fit or not to be an Earth Deity.
What was with herI mean, himher?
Go forth.
An Earth Deity should be able to cleanse thick miasma.
Now we'll see whether you can, Nanami-chan.
Miasma? Why?
The air was so clean yesterday!
Tomoe took such good care of this well too.
Huh? Why?
The air is so clean because you are here.
Abandoned shrines are magnets for miasma.
That's something even I can't cleanse.
Remember how the place looked when you first arrived?
Don't you think it's become more beautiful since then?
Calm down.
I have to calm down!
Cleanse!
Clear!
Remove!
Disperse!
Purify!
Clean! Clean!
Please, begone!
Please, go away!
Why?
Deity Beam!
Deity Beam!
Deity...
Good morning, Nanami-chan!
I finally made a sound!
What's the meaning of this?
The miasma around the shrine has become unbearably thick.
Tomoe-kun.
This isn't normal, is it?
The air was clean yesterday.
Is it because Nanami-chan's power can't dispel it anymore?
Nanami...
Nanami!
Tomoe?
I tried to clear it, but...
Nanami-chan, are you okay?
Mizuki, can you cleanse it?
What? Don't be crazy!
I can still try, though.
The shrine...
Lie down!
We'll do something about it.
It's the Earth Deity's job to cleanse the land.
We don't need you.
Don't move an inch from here!
Don't you have something stronger?
What do you think my precious sacred sake is?
This is just a stopgap!
It loses its power once it dries up.
You're useless!
Not as useless as you!
I... didn't live up to Tomoe's expectations.
I... couldn't do anything without his help.
The truth is...
We don't need you.
I... didn't do anything.
Not once.
No one needs me.
Nanami!
Nanami!
Nanami!
Nanami!
I'm going to town for a while, Tomoe.
Where has she gone?
Nanami!
Nanami can't cleanse the miasma, and has thus fled the shrine.
Tomoe looks everywhere for her, but she is nowhere to be found.
Is this the last they'll ever see of each other?
Next time, I Became a Deity!
It's also the finale.
Look forward to it!
onnanoko hajimemashita
A tired girl starts her day
tameiki wa bioron no shirabe ni nite
With a sigh like the moan of a violin
akai mi hajikechatta
A cherry bursts in her mouth
mada anata wo shiranai
This was before we had met
konna koto hajimetette
This is the first time I've ever felt like this
manazashi wa aku no hana sakimidarete mo
I could see that your pretty eyes were filled with contempt
ie e to tsuzuku
But I had to go home
basu sutoppu demo anata wa tsurenai
Even at the bus stop, you gave me the cold shoulder
karameta hanabi myaku utsu
The fireworks in the sky pulse
koi no shiruetto
In a silhouette of love
karui mahou
With a little magic,
usotsuki na kuchibiru
Two sets of lying lips
sou kasaneteru
Lock together

So, please

It's for a good reason

So let me be bad for once

By flipping my skirt

It looks like Saturday is going to be sunny

God, it has already started
Please, God
I...
I want to meet her
God, I'm in pain
Because, she...
didn't come today either.
I have a request, God
Please, save me
God, it's too late for me
Because she's...
disappeared
Into the distant sky
farewell, Baby
