Deep in the dark Viridian forest,
Ash discovers a Caterpie
and tries his best to make his first Pokemon catch.
Caterpie, you're mine!
Hm.
Hm?
Yes! I did it!
Aha! I did it! I got Caterpie!
I did it all by myself. I caught my first Pokemon!
This is the first step
on my way to becoming the number one Pokemon Master in the whole world.
-Ah! Hey! Wait a minute! -Ha-ha.
I'm getting dizzy! I'm going to get sick! Quit it!
Look out, Pokemon. Nothing's going to stop me now.
ASH CATCHES A POKEMON
-Ash, you're acting like a... -Look.
Inside this ball is the very first Pokemon I ever caught In my whole entire life.
Great. Just keep it away from me, will you?
You're not afraid of an itty-bitty Caterpie in a Poke Ball, are you?
Bugs get me all bugged out, even when they're In a Poke Ball.
Just keep it away!
I like bugs even if they're not in Poke Balls.
It must be great for Caterpie inside the Poke Ball
all cute and comfortable inside there.
I love my new little Pokemon.
I guess it takes a worm to love a worm.
Very funny. Pikachu...
Pika!
Oh, Pikachu, I'm glad you like it.
And from now on, we'll catch a whole bunch of new friends.
Caterpie, you're sticking with us.
Uh. Does that mean-
Caterpie, come out! Ha!
There's nothing to be scared of.
Come on, Caterpie, climb up on my shoulder.
-Hey, Caterpie, come back! -Ah!
Hey, Misty, Caterpie really likes you. Isn't that cute?
Get this disgusting bug away from me!
-Huh? -Please don't come any closer to me, huh!
What? You think Caterpie's disgusting?
-Pika pika. -
I know. You be friends with that creepy bug
-and I'll be friends with Pikachu. -Pikachu only likes me
and zaps anybody who tries to- Huh?
-Argh! Pikachu. -Hmm?
It's so gross. Ash, put that slimy thing back in the Poke Ball!
Bugs are one of the three most disgusting things in the world.
Aside from you, what are the other disgusting things?
Very funny! Carrots, peppers and bugs.
Everybody has something they don't like, and I don't like bugs!
Yeah? Well, I like carrots, and peppers, and bugs.
What I don't like is the way you're hurting Caterpie's feelings
-with your silly fear of bugs. -Hmm!
I don't think you're ugly or disgusting at all, Caterpie.
Come on, climb up on my shoulder.
Chu, chu.
You're not going to scare misty anymore.
-What do you mean he won't scare me? -We'll go on without her.
-Chu! -Oh!
Oh, yeah? I'll show you.
Pi?
-Pika, pi. -Huh? What's the problem, Pikachu?
-Pikachu. -Huh?
Oh.
-What are you following us for? -Uh!
My... my bike. I'm holding you responsible for my bike.
When are you going to get over that dumb old bike?
For your information, Mr. Pokemon Master,
you're the dumb one, because if you hadn't destroyed it in the first place,
I could've ridden out of here by now.
I told you I'd make good on your bike one day.
And if I'm so dumb, how come you're still following me?
I'm not following you. This happens to be the fastest way through the woods.
-Fine. Do whatever you want. -That's exactly what I'm doing!
Pi, pi.
We'd better get some sleep, you guys.
Tomorrow's going to be a big day.
Well, we'd all get some sleep if you'd shut your big mouth.
-Huh. don't let the bedbugs bite. - Humph!
-Cha. -
-Pi. -
Pi!
- -Pi. Pi, pi.
Pikachu!
-Chu. -
-Pikachu! Pikachu! -
Pikachu!
Pi. Pikachu!
Pi, pi, chu, chu! Pikachu!
Pikachu.
Pi.
What's wrong? What's happening?
What is this thing doing sleeping near me?
Huh? Heh, Caterpie just wants to be your friend.
If that thing wants to be my friend it can stop bugging me already.
If you're a Pokemon, get out of my face and into that Poke Ball.
Oh, Misty, you are so unbelievable. Caterpie means no harm.
Why it likes you, I'll never know.
Caterpie, what's the matter?
-Hey, hold on, Caterpie! -Pikachu.
All right, Misty, you owe Caterpie an apology.
-Pokemon have feelings too, you know? -Ah, hmm!
Come on, Caterpie, don't you worry. Someday we'll show her.
Wow, a Pidgeotto!
Pidgeotto, an evolved form of the Pidgey.
It is armed with sharp claws and dives from the sky to capture its prey.
Unlike the more gentle Pidgey, Pidgeotto can be dangerous.
Approach with extreme caution.
All right, Pidgeotto.
Ha, I'll show you who's the dangerous one around here.
Poke Ball, go!
You don't get it, do you?
You don't just throw a Poke Ball and capture a Pokemon.
You have to make it battle and weaken it first.
The only reason you got to catch Caterpie is because it's already a weakling.
I know what I'm doing and you just better quit picking on Caterpie, okay?
And now, if you kindly keep your big mouth shut,
you'll see how it's done.
Go, Caterpie!
- -Pika!
- -Pika!
Ha, I told you I knew what I was doing.
You don't have any idea of the mistake you've just made, do you?
-Did I do something wrong? -
Caterpie!
Caterpie, counterattack!
-Caterpie! -Quick, call it back!
Huh? Caterpie, return! Ugh!
Pikachu, go!
-Pikachu, Thunder Shock, now! -Pikachu!
Poke Ball, go!
Yes! We got Pidgeotto!
Pikachu!
-I am the greatest. -You're the worst!
You have no idea what you're doing.
It'll be a long time till you're a Pokemon Master
-like, a million years. -Ugh. I'm trying to-
You should try to learn something about Pokemon first.
With Pokemon, you've got to use strategy.
Pidgeotto is a bird. Caterpie is a worm.
Birds eat worms, Mr. Pokemon Master!
Well, if you just try hard enough, things will work out, won't they?
No, Ash, I'm afraid things won't just work out
if you try hard enough.
The Pokemon trainer's judgment is more important than anything else,
and unfortunately for you, the trainer has to have a brain!
-Uh... - Ha-ha.
So we meet again.
I know that voice.
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie! -James!
No, not this again.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light!
Surrender now, or prepare to fight.
Meowth! That's right!
-Uh, we're kind of busy now, So if you- -Quiet, little boy.
We're not here to listen to you. We're here to get your Pokemon.
- Hand over that Pikachu. -Huh?
Hey, this is my Pikachu. Go out and find your own.
The only Pikachu we want is that one.
We're only looking for the rarest, most valuable Pokemon in the world, kid.
And that special Pikachu's just the kind of Pokemon we need.
You idiots, stop giving away all our secrets!
Is my Pikachu really that special?
Your Pikachu's powers impress even me.
I really got a charge out of it's incredible attack the last time we met.
Its powers exceed its evolutionary level. Your Pokemon would-
Now you're the one giving away all our secrets!
Shut up before you tell them everything!
I'm in charge! Cut it out!
Make things easy and hand over that Pikachu.
-Huh, forget it! -Then you leave us no choice.
Pokemon battle! Ekans, go!
-Koffing, go get them! -Koffing!
-Ekans! -Hey, two against one? That's cheating!
Well, as we say, all's fair in love, war, and Pokemon battles.
I say that saying's rotten and so are you.
Of course we are. We're the bad guys.
Well, if they're going to use two Pokemon, I don't see why we can't use two Pokemon.
The Pokemon league rules say only one at a time.
Ash, if you follow the rules, you're going to lose all your Pokemon.
Koffing, sludge attack, now!
If you think you can use your dirty tricks to beat me, you're wrong!
They might try anything to get what they want.
But no matter what happens, don't let them have Pikachu, understand?
Misty, come on!
-But what about the other two? -
So, what's your big battle plan?
I can't send Caterpie. It's too weak from the last battle.
Pidgeotto, go!
Koffing, it's grime time.
Koffing.
Ekans, go get your dinner.
Pidgeotto, quick attack!
Ekans, go underground.
Pidgeotto, behind you. Watch out!
Pidgeotto!
We're going to get a Pokemon! We're going to get a Pokemon!
We're going to get a Pokemon!
-Koffing! -Ekans!
Gust counterattack, now!
Koffing...
Pidgeotto, return!
-Ah! I'll show you! -Ash!
-All right, let's go! Put'em up! -Ha, what a fool.
In Pokemon battles, only the Pokemon can fight each other.
-Buzz off. - Ow!
-Are you okay? -Guess you've got no choice.
Let Pikachu in and watch Team Rocket win.
Pikachu!
No, Pikachu, you can't battle In this condition.
-Pi... -Ash, what are-
I know you're still weak From battling Pidgeotto,
but now, Caterpie, you're my only hope.
Just give it your very best shot.
Caterpie, go!
-What's that? -It's a bug, a measly little bug.
- -Let's get the bug spray.
Koffing...
-Koffing! -Ekans!
Pika!
Hang in there.
Koffing!
Caterpie, string shot, now!
-Ah! -Uh? Beaten by a Caterpie?
That really bugs me.
Now watch a real Pokemon in action.
It's time Team Rocket blasted off.
You may have won this round but we'll be back.
Come back anytime. We'll be glad to beat you. Mm!
We did it. We did it!
We won our first Pokemon Victory fair and square!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Caterpie, I'm very proud of you.
You really did your best and we won because of you.
-You're stronger than you look, Caterpie. -Pika.
Well, Misty, I guess you feel different about Caterpie now.
-Uh, well, I... -So why don't you two make up?
Just pat Caterpie on the head and say thanks for a really great job.
You like Pokemon, so it's only right to congratulate one for doing a good job.
I guess you're right.
- -Caterpie?
- What? - It's evolving.
Caterpie, this is so great.
Metapod, Caterpie's next stage.
It has encased its body in a hard shell.
This specimen reached this stage faster
than any previously discovered Pokemon of this variety.
Hey, maybe that means it could keep on changing
and go on to the next stage right away.
Nice to meet you, Metapod.
-Not in the mood to talk? -Pikachu.
I've never known anyone like him. He really does love Pokemon.
Hm? Ah!
Misty, you two were just about to make friends.
-You didn't forget, did you? -I didn't forget, but I...
Ah!
Oh, I'll do anything. Let's just get out of this forest.
No way. There're still plenty more Pokemon in this forest.
Hey, wait for me!
Come on, we've got lots of Pokemon to catch!
The future looks bright for our heroes now,
but up ahead, the Viridian Forest is deeper and darker than they know
and a dangerous new challenge is waiting.
