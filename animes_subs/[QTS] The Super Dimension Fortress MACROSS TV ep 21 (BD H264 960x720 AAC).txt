Piercing through the Macro sky,
a thunderbolt strikes the Earth
To awaken us, the young mankind,
the Light struck
Macross! Macross!
The brave youths who arise
and fight to protect their loved ones
Will set out on their journey as the war rages on.
Will you love me tomorrow?
Slicing through the darkness they fly toward
That blue planet that shines in the distance
Macross! Macross!
Macross!
The Macross has been practically banished from Earth.
However, the morale of the civilians onboard was high enough
to permit the completion of the kung-fu movie, Shao Pai Long.
Tonight, a party is being held on the eve of the film's premiere.
MICRO COSMOS
Hikaru, what are you doing these days?
I haven't seen you for ages.
And what is the star of tonight's party doing out here all alone?
And what is my manager doing drinking too much vodka?
You can't call this too much.
Too much is when I see two of you,
which would make me extremely, outrageously happy!
Because I'd be twice as pretty?
Nah, no way.
Because I could schedule you for twice as much!
I'm joking, I'm joking.
Now come inside before you catch a cold.
I'm so tired.
Tired? Well, no more getting sick.
That last time was bad enough!
No, I meant tired of all this.
Aah, you're just feeling blue because the movie's done
and your schedule's wound down a bit.
That's not quite it.
I know! Can I get a seat reserved for the premiere?
But that's tomorrow! And it's already so late...
You really can't?
I'll figure something out. Just wait, I'll get you that seat!
See you!
A seat reserved for the premiere. A great idea if I say so myself!
Ah, Miss Minmay, our big star.
It is I, Jamis the villain.
I'm so sorry! I almost ruined your lovely dress, didn't I?
No, it's...
But it was quite expensive, wasn't it?
Not as expensive as mine, but...
Oh, Jamis, dear!
C'mon, Jamis! Let's go!
Yes, I'm coming, Mr. Company President!
Oh, is that Minmay?
Oh, let's leave the child alone.
Adults should keep the company of adults, yes?
That's another thing that's making me tired.
Minmay! I got a message from your manager.
He got you a VIP seat, A-5.
Oh, that's great! Thank you!
Thank your manager.
Come on, we have to make an early day of it tomorrow. Time for bed.
Okay.
I'll walk you to your room.
Hello. Military barracks, men's residence.
Umm, is 1st Lt. Ichijo there, please?
Lt. Ichijo? One moment, please.
Ah, the Lieutenant is flying escort for a recon plane right now.
When will he be back?
I couldn't tell you that, miss.
Oh, I see. Could you please tell him he has seat A-5 waiting for him at the premiere of Shao Pai Long?
Seat A-5. And your name, please?
Just tell him it was Nyan-Nyan.
He'll understand if I tell him that?
Yes! Well, thanks for your help.
Sure, my pleasure.
Where could he have gone to?
And after I got him a reserved seat too.
I'm back.
Good evening, sir.
Oh, Lieutenant! Lieutenant Ichijo!
Yes, what?
You got a phone call a little while ago.
From who?
A young lady. Said you'd know who if I said Nyan-Nyan.
Huh? Really?! All right!
Ah! And she said that seat A-5 was...
He's gone. Oh, well.
Hello? Is Miss Minmay there?
Oh...
Well, can you connect me with the hotel switchboard?
Hurry up, pick up the phone.
I don't care if it was just for fun, you can't go wandering around dressed like that, can you?!
Now go to bed. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
What was that phone call about?
Minmay never calls me anymore.
Oh wait. Shao Pai Long premieres tomorrow.
Warriors!
The one who shot me down could be among them.
Hey! This way!
What is this crowd here for?
Stop pushing! Move back!
Hey, it's Minmay!
Wow, Minmay sure is popular, huh?
Yeah, good thing we got in line first thing this morning.
I'm so grateful to all of you for showing up so early today.
Thanks to the full cooperation of the military, Shao Pai Long has finally been completed.
And now, let me present the film's stars.
I'm pleased to introduce Lynn Kaifun and Lynn Minmay!
So, Minmay, how was your first starring role?
Really hard. You scolded me every day, Mr. Director.
Hey, hey! Was I really that bad?
Sorry about that. You were actually very kind to me.
If anything, I was a bother to the staff.
But I really worked on this as hard as I could.
I hope you all enjoy the film.
Thank you, Minmay.
Just a little longer and then you can rest up backstage.
And Kaifun, do you have anything you'd like to add?
Yes, I do. It was an honor for a novice like me to have been involved in such a big production.
Y'know, I heard that Minmay and Kaifun are going out!
Your warm support is what made this possible.
No way! Really?
Really!
That's a lie! You've got a lot of nerve saying that in front of the Minmay Fan Club!
Shut up, you guys! I can't hear!
Well, enough opening remarks.
Minmay, would you be so kind?
Okay!
I hope you like this. It's the theme song to Shao Pai Long.
Remember!
Dancing in the sky, the silver wings
Shao Pai Long!
Shao Pai Long!
Remember!
The eyes of fire splitting the darkness
Shao Pai Long!
Shao Pai Long!
To save a diseased city, he has returned
Evil's slayer! Slayer! Slayer!
Shao...
Image enhancement is complete, sir.
Very good. Onscreen.
Shao Pai Long!
Shao Pai Long!
It seems to be a visual combat record.
Such a primitive combat!
Why would they be so eager to view a combat record like this?
To save a diseased city, he has returned
Well, I have no idea, sir.
Evil's slayer! Slayer! Slayer!
That unique fighting style...
Could he be the one who defeated me?
Shao Pai Long!
Is a very messiah!
The light of hope, a messiah!
Hey, that's Minmay!
Moving! Speaking!
Guys, Minmay's a lot cuter in person.
Shao Pai Long!
We got to see the real Minmay, in the flesh!
We're Minmay's friends, you know!
Hey, look!
What was that just now?
Could it be?! Is it the legendary power?
What? They have abilities like that?!
It would explain that energy barrier we encountered previously!
I suppose we should inform Lord Bodolzaa of this.
Ow!
Sorry...
You're blockin' my view!
What is... this feeling?
My heart's gotten all warm.
This culture stuff gives you feelings like that all the time!
Is culture really that incredible?
It's fantastic.
Did you... Did you all do stuff like this with Minmay?!
Uh, yeah!
We sure did.
And not just once or twice either!
Gah! I'm sorry!
1st Lt. Ichijo!
Captain Hayase! I'm sorry. I sort of tripped, and...
And I just happened to be there, is that it?
Of course.
Who'd touch your butt unless it was by accident?
I beg your pardon!
You tell him, sister!
Call the cops on that pervert!
Come with me! No one respects the military anymore!
I've never been so embarrassed!
What were you doing there, anyway?
I just went to see the movie...
And you had to leave in the middle, too?
An enemy attack!
Transformation initiated.
All civilians, please get to your shelters.
They're transforming already?
Captain, do you know where the shelter for this area is?
We're about to be attacked! We'll have to run back to the base!
Hurry! The shelter's this way!
Minmay!
Are you all right, Minmay?
You okay? You're not hurt?
You must have been scared. You're safe now.
Can't the military even give us enough time to evacuate?
This is a safe location. Please remain calm.
Jeez, and it was almost over, too.
I have to find that man.
I think we'll be all right if we go this way.
You just had to take us around that corner!
What else could we do?
If a path takes a turn, you turn with it!
Besides, if we hadn't, we would have been crushed.
What we should have done is head to a shelter...
Is that any way to talk to a superior officer?!
Could you not pull rank at a time like this?
It looks like the attack has begun.
I wonder if Shammy's okay?
No, no! Phalanx Pearl Battery goes to, uh...
C-4 block, not B block!
Please make your orders clearer!
I'm sorry.
Oh, Captain Hayase, come back soon!
Come on, stop pouting and say something.
Lt. Ichijo, say something!
Please, say something.
Even if it's just to badmouth me.
I get lonely when people don't talk.
I never thought I'd hear you admit that YOU get lonely!
Well, excuse me!
There you go. That's the Captain I know.
So was the one you just heard...
To be honest, I was getting a little lonely too.
I was wondering... Hey, listen...
Go ahead.
Well, I was wondering why they transformed so quickly.
When I'm not around, 2nd Lt. Shammy is the one who gives tactical orders.
Oh, that explains it.
She's been specially trained for it, you know.
Say, I wonder if Max is doing okay?
Relax, he's a genius, remember?
Yeah, he's a better pilot than I am.
He's a genius. His combat awareness and piloting skills are top notch.
Just please don't say that in front of him.
Why not?
Well... Not that I think he's the type, but the thing to be most afraid of when going into battle is overconfidence.
You actually sound like a real commander!
I guess.
Somebody must be talking about me.
Being like this reminds me of when we were captured.
Yeah, that time was...
It was rather difficult, wasn't it?
But things aren't nearly as desperate now as they were then.
After all, we're still on board the Macross.
That's right. We're not on some enemy ship!
Still, we're cut off.
We'll be out soon, as soon as the enemy attack lets up.
But after this one ends, there will be another.
They just don't give up, do they?
But why do you think they keep letting us live?
They have all that power, but...
That's right.
You may have already heard this, but the enemy seems to have split into two factions.
One faction thinks that we're Protoculture,
which they fear so much they want to prevent any contact with us.
And then there are the guys who want us dead.
That's right. As a result, their chain of command is in chaos,
which could be why we only get these sporadic attacks.
But how long can this situation last?
And if they get things under control, what happens to us?
Do we get to live? Or will they kill us all?
Purple Battery, the main enemy force has shifted toward you.
Phalanx Ruby Battery, please provide support for Purple Battery.
Looks like she's gotten the hang of giving orders, huh?
Well, she's still got a lot to learn...
Please! No chatter during combat!
Aye, aye. Understood.
Are you getting thirsty?
Cola!
Ichijo, what's wrong? Are you all right?
Cola! Cola!
Cola!
Hey! Cola!
Ahh, dammit!
Forget it, Ichijo. Sit down.
By the way, what were you doing at the movie theater, Captain Hayase?
What brought that up?
Nothing. I just thought of it so I figured I'd ask.
Is there a reason you don't want to talk about it?
It's not like that! I just went to see the movie, same as you.
You were watching the movie, were you? Really?
Yes, I was! I even heard Kaifun and Minmay's intro.
Oh? I never took you for the movie-going type.
What's wrong with that?! I'm a normal girl too, you know!
Girl? Yeah, right. Old lady, maybe.
That's uncalled for!
'Cause a girl is more... Wait a minute.
A woman like you wouldn't have gone to see the film for Minmay.
That's it! You were there for Kaifun!
That's not true!
I'm right! I'm right, aren't I?!
Captain Hayase, you went to see that movie for Kaifun!
So, Miss Hayase, what is it about Kaifun that you find attractive?
Stop making fun of me!
So things are just great between you and Minmay, are they?
Minmay...
It feels like it was ten years ago.
Come on... Come on...
Don't let what I said get to you.
Don't take it so seriously.
Did you walk out of that theater for the same reason I did?
But how can you like a guy who hates the military?
He... looks a lot like someone I used to care for.
Someone who died before I could tell him anything.
Thanks...
Still, seeing you act like this seems almost like a put-on.
I'm sorry. The memories got a little too strong there.
It's all right.
The kind of life we're living, we all need someone to love.
I guess so.
The enemy is retreating.
It's finally over.
Shammy, can you hurry up and take us off of battle alert?
I have a date I'd like to keep.
That's up to the Captain.
What do you think we should do?
Live each day to the fullest. That's all we can do, isn't it?
Only that?
Only that.
They're switching back to normal mode.
That's right. I guess we've been saved, huh?
Want a cola?
Treating a superior officer? Maybe in ten years.
Well, bottoms up.
What are you doing?
Quiet!
What's wrong?
No, Captain, you don't need to see this.
Well, what did we expect?
It's okay. Kaifun is her cousin, right?
Besides, Minmay is friendly with everybody.
But those two look like more than just friends.
Well, I'm gonna check out things on the Prometheus, so...
You can check the hangar later, can't you?
Couldn't you stay with me a little longer?
Sure...all right.
