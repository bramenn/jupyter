Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
The execution is tomorrow
When I heard that, I was surprised, but strangely enough I wasnt sad.
It must be because of the dream I had last night
That dream about the night Ill never forget.
Please wait here a moment. The captain shall be arriving soon.
Um...
Yes! What is it?!
Im just an ordinary new squad member.
Could you please address me less formally?
Ah Yes! Ill be careful in the future!
Whos that girl?
You know, from the Kuchiki clan
I heard she was exempt from the graduation exam
as well as the squad entrance exam
Just a pastime for the great nobles
Theyve got to be kidding! Were here busting our butts
Its the same here, after all
Hey, hey! What are you guys doing loitering around here?
This isnt a show!
Get back to your posts, damn it!
Im the Lieutenant, Kaien Shiba! Nice to meet ya!
Umm Yes, sir
Umm Yes, sir”?
Whats with that greeting?!
Your Lieutenant just introduced himself!
Youre supposed to state your name and say, Pleased to meet you too, sir,” right?!
Whats your name, damn it?!
Im RuRukia Kuchiki, sir.
Oh? And...?
P-Pleased to meet you too, sir!
Good!
All right, Rukia!
An ordinary greeting, an ordinary yelling,
an ordinary subordinate-superior relationship
Our captain isnt in the best of health,
so Im pretty much in charge of things here!
So I wouldnt mind if you sometimes call me Captain Kaien” by mistake!
Umm, Ill think about it.
But that ordinariness was, without doubt, just what I was seeking.
Brother, my squad entrance process was completed without incident.
What Seat are you?
Ahwell My deepest apologies
With my abilities, Im afraid
I couldnt get an officers seat upon entry
I see.
You may leave.
Whats with the long face, you!
Eek!
Whats with you? Every time you see me, you go Eek!”
Youre going to hurt my feelings.
Hey, heres your share, drink up!
Y-yes, sir
Knowing you, even if I asked why youre depressed
you probably wouldnt tell me
Dont you forget this.
As long as youre a member of this squad, Im on your side no matter what.
So cool!
You stink!
Wow! Youre so cool, Sir Kaien!
You stink! You stink!
Did you hear that? Im on your side.” On your side!”
Gotta love him, huh?! Got him wrapped around your finger!
Kiyone! Sentaro!
You guys went off and got drunk again didnt you, damn it!
Kuchiki! Dont let it bother you! Im from Rukon District, too!
When I first came here, there were those who gave me a hard time about it!
But for snot-heads like that,
you just have to rub the snot right back at em!
Snot-heads!
How annoying!
What a bunch of loudmouthed drunks!
You guys need to come back to your senses!
Sir Kaien, youre too rough sir, too rough!
Shut up! Youre still on the clock, damn it!
Oh, dont be a square!
I felt comfortablebeing by Sir Kaien.
Take this!
Well done!
As always, Sir Kaien!
Our Lieutenant took it down!
Mission accomplished!
Ah-Ouch
Lady Miyako
Are you all right?
Y-Yes, its nothing really!
I see Thats good.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, Miyako, I didnt know you were here.
Just in case you let the Hollow get away.
I thought I should come to take care of things.
I wouldnt get beaten that easily!
Kuchiki, sorry, but could you call Sentaro and Kiyone?
Were pulling out!
Yes, sir!
Lady Miyako, thank you very much.
Take care.
Yes!
Sir Kaien had a wife
Although a woman, she had risen to the rank of the 3rd seat.
Despite being a woman warrior, she was intelligent, kindand beautiful
I admired her I wanted to be like her
She was my ideal
Then one day,
Lady Miyako received orders for a reconnaissance mission.
It seems we dont know a thing about this Hollow.
None of the Soul Reapers attacked by it has survived.
Dont get reckless.
My, I never thought Id hear those words from you.
Quit kidding around.
I cannot forgive a Hollow that disturbs a souls peace.
As a Soul Reaper of the proud Thirteen Court Guard Squads,
I must stop their evil deeds.
Lady Miyako
Dont worry. Its just a reconnaissance mission.
Ill leave the rest to you guys.
Well then, well be going.
Are you all right?
Yes Dont worry.
Excuse me.
Kuchiki, any report from the reconnaissance team yet?
No sir, they still have not returned.
I-Its terrible! The reconnaissance team!
Miyako!
Shes unconscious, but her life is not in danger.
And the rest?
Theyre all dead.
All dead
Sir Kaien
This sure is terrible
The entire reconnaissance teams dead, except for Lady Miyako!
Is Lady Miyako all right?
Yeah They said that her lifes not in danger.
Well, thats good
Shes definitely someone that Squad 13 couldnt do without.
Yeah
Hm? My, Lady Miyako, should you be up already?
Wh-Whats happening?! Lady Miyako
What was that?!
Lady Miyako
What, what happened here?!
Oh, no!
Stop it, Miyako!
O-Oh, no!
What in the world?
Sir Kaien
Captain She couldnt have gone very far yet.
Wait, Kaien! Hold it!
If you chase her now, youre doing exactly what the enemy wants you to do!
But still, I must go.
It controlled Miyako,
and used her to kill off those subordinates who cared for her.
It sullied her pride.
Please let me goCaptain!
Fine. Then I shall go with you.
Captain
Rukia, you come too!
Yes, sir!
You two, take command of this place and prepare the battle stations!
Understood!
Lets go!
I smell them The smellof those foolish prey
Thats!
Kaien!
Sir Kaien, Ill go first and check it out
CaptainI beg of you.
Please let me go by myself.
Okay
So you are the first, eh?! Boy!
Hey, you!
How many Soul Reapers have you eaten so far?
I wonderhow many?
Sorry, but I dont remember the count.
Have you regretted iteven once?
Thats a silly question, boy. I too, like you, have a heart.
There isnt a night that I dont have regrets after eating a Soul Reaper.
Even now, Im having regrets
I was just regretting that I should have used
that woman Soul Reaper more before consuming her.
So you controlled Miyako and made her kill her comrades
Controlled?
No, not quite. At that time, I was inside that woman.
Its too bad that I couldnt show you the part
where I devoured that woman to revert to this form
Want to come? Come! Come, come! Ill eat you up!
Youre fast! But
You touched me!
Rankle the seas and the skies! Nejibana!
What?!
You fell for it!
When someone touches my feelers, their zanpaku-to vanishes!
Thats impossible! Never heard of such a power
Sir Kaien!
Captain! But, why?! We must help Sir Kaien!
If we help him, what will become of his pride?
If you help him now, it will probably save his life.
However, at the same time, you will surely be killing his pride forever.
So, what about his pride? Whats pride compared to ones life?
Listen well, and remember this.
There are two types of battles, and as long as we place ourselves in battle,
we must always be aware of the difference between the two.
Battles to protect lives and battles to protect pride!
Right now, he is fighting for pride!
His subordinates pride
His own pride
And above all for his beloved wifes pride
Whats the matter?
Arent you going to ask your friends for help?
Shut up! I can handle you all by myself!
Is that so? Then I shall do unto you the same as I did unto your beloved wife.
I will control your body from within, and against your will
I shall slay your comrades! Amusing, isnt it?
SirKaien
What is it?
Did you call me, girl?
Sir Kaien
Why do you keep calling my name?
Are you that worried about me? Are you that much
in love with me, girl?
If you love me that muchthen I shall eat you first!
Captain
Run, Rukia.
Hurry up! Do you want to die?!
Why? Why did this have to happen?!
Why? Sir Kaien!
Whats the matter? Why wont you attack me?!
I know why!
Youre thinking of a way to drag me out of this body, arent you?!
Its useless!
I am a spirit being, and he is a spirit being. Now our spirits are united.
It can never be undone!
I see Then you leave me no choice.
I shall kill you along with Kaiens body!
Damn you! Are you crazy? Youre going to kill your own man?!
Yes, I will.
I cannot allow the likes of you to possess Kaiens body!
You wont get away!
At a time like this
You idiot! Why did you come back?!
At the time I came back, I didnt even have a plan.
Captain
Thank you so much
For letting mefight
Yeah
S-Sir Kaien? Did youintentionally?
Rukia I made you go along with my selfish request
and put you through a horrible time
Sorry about that, it must have been harsh
Thanks to you I can leave my heart here
No I havent done a single thing to be thanked for
The only person I saved was myself
Im detestable Im not worthy of being saved
Im not worth shedding blood overever
Byakuya!
Its terrible! Rukias execution has
I heard.
I see, then
And what about it?
What did you say?
The execution is tomorrow. If thats the decision, then I simply obey it.
Do not interrupt me with such needless talk.
Excuse me.
H-hey, you!
Enough joking around! It really is tomorrow!
At tomorrow noon, your sister will be
Dont get so excited. Youll shorten your life, Ukitake.
Youve already let one of your men die before, havent you?
In any case, she is a member of my house.
Whether she dies or gets killed, its none of your business.
I would like you to refrain from any rash actions.
Happy people
Come on, come on, come on

Within your heart, you may feel uneasy
But keep your head right up!

Isnt that a crime?!
