Go out with you?
I don't really know.
Yeah.
Give me some time to answer.
Yeah.
I've hardly talked to Azumi-kun since then.
Hi-yah!
What the heck?
Bullet train!
Yay!
You're pretty excited.
Did you bring underwear, Kota?
Shut up.
Roman, I'm upgrading from boxers to make my boxer briefs debut today.
Better look forward to it.
What? Finally?
Wait, really?
I've always worn boxer briefs.
My debut...
We're doing a luggage check.
Sensei, that's a girl's...
Okay, next.
All right, I'll check it, then.
No cell phones, remember?
I'll hold on to this.
She caught me!
Too bad. Hidaka was so easy.
Potato Chips Lightly Salted
All right, next.
They got quite a few of us.
Where were you hiding your phone?
I hid mine in my underwear.
Her phone's in her panties?!
Dude, don't.
Panties!
Seriously? That's hot.
Ta-da.
Wow.
You really can't tell.
I opened it once, then closed it with tape.
Here.
Good, now I'll be ready if she sends an answer.
Point the camera to the right, Akanecchi.
Like this?
No... Up.

You have someone, don't you?
If you're curious about someone, that counts, too.
There is someone I'm curious about.
Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who?
Hira?
Did he ask you out?
Hira's cool.
You should go out with him.
Just like that?
No, I...
That was close.
The teacher was right there.
That scared me.
Why are you guys here?
Why not?
What's the problem?
We're going to be the ones to get yelled at.
Why so cold?
We don't want you here.
Come on, we're already here.

Don't get too carried away.
Be mindful and considerate of the people around you.
Hey, where's Setsuko?
Off with Nagahara.
Where should we go first?
What about Kaneko?
Who cares?
You're coming with us, right, Akanecchi?
Um...
If you want, tomorrow at 12:00 in front of Doimaru Department Store
Huh? Say what?
Suspicious.
Uh... Yeah.
No secrets, remember?
I, uh... My parents are asking about souvenirs.
Oh, that's all?
Want to come with us, then?
Oh, yeah.
Where should we go?
I heard the bus might be faster.
Yo, Kota.
Let's go!
Want to?

See you later!
I'm at Doimaru Department Store
Where are you?
Didn't you say you were going to practice here, Chinatsu?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
No, I know I said I would, but...
Where are you?
He's not answering me.
It's pouring.
It's so cold.
We're all wet.
Here, I'll wipe you off.
Hey, that tickles.
We aren't dating.
I never even gave him an answer.
He might not come.
H-Hey...
Curly-kun?
What?
You scared me for a second.
I thought you were going to hit on us.
You're soaked.
What happened?
Wait...
Can I go?
Sorry, I'll be in touch later.
So what's up?
I, uh...
Can you lend me your phone?
Sure.
Here.
Shoot, I don't know her number.
I can't ask her to tell me Mizuno-san's phone number.
I couldn't possibly...
Actually, never mind.
Let me guess...
Akane?
Wh-Wh-Why?
I mean, come on, Curly-kun...
Oh, forget it.
So are we calling Akane?
Yes, please.
Hello, Akane?
Here.
H-Hey...
Who's this?
Azumi.
Why?
Some stuff happened...
I don't get it.
I was waiting for you.
Where are you?
You're so late.
Sorry.
You told me to meet you here,
so I came, but you weren't here.
It's raining, and you aren't answering your phone.
S-Sorry.
The teacher took my phone.
Why Chinatsu's phone?
You guys are close, huh?
She just happened to...
What?
Nothing.
I don't know.
I don't know, but we can't even talk at all...
Yeah.
I want...
to talk with you more, Azumi-kun.
Is that...
your answer?
Yeah.
