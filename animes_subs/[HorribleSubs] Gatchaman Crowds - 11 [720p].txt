Hajime-chan, you were already my favorite the moment I met you.
I felt you accepted me for who I was right away,
and that made me so happy.
You're always like that, aren't you?
You don't care at all about appearances or labels.
You look right at the person in front of you.
You bypass conventions that everyone's going along with,
with such careless ease.
Well, like...
There's no point in cutting them down.
Oh, more importantly,
it's like, I haven't really met them!
Yeah, that's it!
That's why even Utsutsu, who never opened up to anyone before...
Whoa!
Are you trying to reject the basic premise of Gatchaman?
I've been alive for three centuries,
but I've never met anyone like you.
I have a feeling that you'll change us lonely caged birds
like you fold origami shapes.
I've never felt this way in the G-team before!
Senpai!
Huh?
What would you think if I died?
What?
O-Of course I'd be sad.
That's right, girl.
You're like the sun that shines brightly on us,
no, everyone on this planet.
You're way too bright!
You're the G-team's shining sun!
Hajime, you know... back then...
Every single day, I wanted to vanish and disappear.
I'm gloomy...
You can't.
I can because my body is weird.
Wow. That's great.
It's not great.
I felt that way because I didn't know why I had been born.
That's why I used to hate you because you
were always so full of energy.
I thought you'd take OD away from me.
But I began to notice who you were as a person.
I'm gloomy...
Utsutsu-chan, you're fine just the way you are.
I wondered why you would care
to look at me when I was such a failure.
And I used to hate you so much.
I guess things like this really happen.
I found myself starting to want to be noticed by you,
Okay, go!
A present to Utsutsu-chan for a good deed!
What?
and be with you.
We had a lot of fun today, Utsutsu-chan!
What?
Let's play hide-and-seek together again!
I was so happy...
What's the matter?
O-Origami.
I'm happy now that I was born,
because I was able to meet you.
But I'm still just me.
Go, Bird!
That's okay, right?
You told me it was...
I'm the leader, Paiman.
Hey, Newbie.
You were trouble from the very beginning.
I was always scolding you.
I thought that you didn't take Gatchaman duties seriously enough.
I thought you were a disappointment.
But...
you had already noticed from early on
that I was always running.
You knew that I was clinging
to the god-like JJ-sama, because he was insurance
against my own fear and pathetic indecisiveness.
I was caving in under the pressure of being the leader.
I knew I must not run.
I knew I must make a decision.
But, I just couldn't muster the confidence...
I was a failure as the leader.
But you said...
That's not true!
If you need to run,
you should run the best you can!
Then you can just take your time to think.
I was shocked.
Pai-Pai.
Most things in life are unexpected.
You were totally right.
I began to think for myself.
I began to face who I was: a pathetic loser.
That was when I finally realized
what you had been asking of me...
what I really wanted to do.
I found myself repeating the words you'd said to me.
Do you love this country?
Hey, Newbie.
Listen up.
I'll only say it once.
You're the first human to understand how I felt.
I...
I am the leader...
of the Gatchaman, protectors of this planet!
Berg-Katze is nothing to fear!
Bow down before my courageous wings!
Go, Bird!
Bite and Build!
Transform!
You're so cool, Panda Man!
Run, kids!
Okay!
All right, I'm heading out.
Miss, when I met you,
I thought of myself as a little shit.
After meeting JJ and many other aliens,
I felt we had such a small existence.
I thought of you as a useless newbie, too.
I thought there was nothing for us to reach an understanding on.
But...
you weren't an average Jane.
I wondered if you might be someone extraordinary.
But I didn't want to accept that.
Achieving world peace?
I had started to give up on my goal as being too naive.
Oh, it's MESSY-chan!
All right!
Okay!
But you continued to believe and pressed on.
Utsutsu?
Doing that will kill you!
I want to save them!
You know that, right?
But I want to save them!
You set all of our hearts on fire,
in a big red blaze.
I'm gloomy...
Hey, give us a hand here, too!
This is how it should be...
I am no one special...
I'm just...
Thank you, Jou-san...
And now, I...
I can tell you this now.
Way too...
lame!
You're amazing!
Do you have any idea what crazy shit you just pulled?
Humans are still worth saving!
Go, Bird!
Go, Bird!
Could you be...
the new team member?
I'm Ichinose Hajime!
I think I somehow became a Gatchaman today.
At the time, I...
It's Senpai and me!
I was totally confused by everything you said and did.
Someone might feel awful, but can't skip work.
Someone might be sick, too.
Maybe it's not what I thought.
We had a huge fight afterwards.
Wh-What the...
You idiot!
I just didn't understand you back then.
I could only butt heads with you.
But, one day, it occurred to me that...
Newbie, you should just follow Sugane's orders, for now!
Boo!
Hey, it's not bad.
I'm not cut out for this, after all.
It's fine.
Everyone's is different.
Hey!
What are you doing?
You have to be kidding me...
MESS-chan!
Good morning!
Nice to meet you!
I think we've now met!
Hey, it's not safe.
Stop.
You...
Senpai, aren't there times when you find yourself taking
action without even thinking about it?
I think you've taught me...
Hey!
The time is now!
That's what heroes do!
We don't need your prophecies anymore.
This is our planet.
So, we'll do as we wish.
That is all I have to say.
that belongs only to you.
Reveal your names!
If you will not, then listen!
We are...
the wings that protect this planet!
We're the Gatchaman!
I wasn't the only one who had that insight.
I think everyone did.
That's why we
could take flight from the cramped bird cage.
All right!
Let's all work together to protect Tachikawa.
Three, two...
Gatcha!
Can you see me?
Rui...?
Rui-kun?
Hmm? X, my friend?
Oh, well.
I don't need any friends.
As long as I have this NOTE, I'm invincible!
Tachikawa Live Updates Thread
But I want to know if I'm truly invincible.
Tachikawa Live Updates Thread
Tachikawa Live Updates Thread
And the truth is...
It's show time!
Are you watching this city?!
This wasn't what we were trying to do, is it?
I don't want to see any more bloodshed!
Answer me!
Rui?
Rui,
did you see the sunset yesterday?
I did.
It was beautiful.
I thought so, too.
How joyous...
What's up, Rui-kun?
Hajime-chan, my friend came back.
Great!
Let's connect the Tachikawa team with everyone through GALAX, then!
Hey, everyone. X came back!
Please look to GALAX to figure out your next course of action!
Understood!
I've got this!
Phoenix Dive!
Rending Gale Blade!
Sugane, isn't this nostalgic?
Yes!
X, what's the GALAX penetration rate among Tachikawa citizens?
Approximately sixty percent.
108,234 out of 180,000 are registered users.
That's less than I expected.
Huh?
The Gatchannel?
Yeah, I want you to tell the people something as their Prime Minister.
Oh, no way.
No one will listen to me.
They all look down on the Prime Minister, anyway.
Then why don't you quit being one?
Huh?
Try to imagine that you've resigned, in your heart.
I'm sure you'll feel a lot better!
Oh, by the way, the show's already on.
Huh? You're kidding.
Please Wait
I wrote everything down here.
I'm counting on you, Suga-yan!
Su...
Suga-yan?!
You want me to handle it, right?
You can count on me.
X is back!
X, we need intel on the injured and the disaster!
Understood.
Injured people requesting assistance are marked by a human icon.
Fires are marked by a flame icon.
Okay.
Uh, I'm Sugayama.
Gatcha...
Uh... So Tachikawa citizens...
Please register on GALAX as soon as possible.
Use GALAX to figure out what you can do... Huh?
What's this?
Lame-o Prime Minister
Who are you calling lame?!
Bite and Build!
To all G members!
I will keep the CROWDS coming from Hino at bay!
Jou, cover the train station!
Sugane, defend the school!
Understood!
Utsutsu, protect the river!
Roger!
Go, my fragments!
Understood!
I'm gloomy...
Hajime, cover the park!
Sure thing, Pai-Pai!
Die?
How can you even say that to someone you've never met?
I have a family, too!
They'd be heartbroken if they were watching right now!
Have you ever thought of that? Huh?
Wow.
Don't give me that crap!
I'm just me!
Keep going, Suga-yan!
Sugayama respect
Each location of the CROWDS is marked by an X,
and the Gatchaman's combat locations are marked by stars.
Please split up and protect the citizens from the CROWDS.
Roger!
Everyone, don't worry!
There are no CROWDS in this area, at the moment.
Even if they attack,
we, with the help of the Gatchaman, will hold them off with everything we've got!
Thank goodness...
Thanks.
We're counting on you!
Stay strong!
GALAX users, please keep an eye on updates
and relay information to non-GALAX users!
You fix it, bastard!
Negligence
You fix it, bastard?
You're the leader, aren't you?
You're living life off our taxes!
The country's in danger!
So you think someone else will always figure it out, don't you?!
GALAX is too scary to use!
Now you're pissed at us?
He's pissed and you're the PM?
Pissed
True colors showing!
True self's showing, SG
And when they don't, you'll bitch and moan.
He's hopeless
Dude, he's scary
Is he srsly yelling at us?
Talk about holier than thou
Don't put it on us-
But what did you do?!
Why are we getting blamed?
Dude, calm down
Don't make it sound so easy!
Have you ever done anything for this nation, even once?
Don't look at me
You've been found out
Srsly, a lecture?
Well...
You're telling us that?
Nope
Sry, dude
You don't even go to elections!
If I had to pick, nope
Sry, bout that, dude
Touche
If you've got complaints, try a hand at being the Prime Minister!
The Prime Minister's lost it.
I'm starting to like him!
And go change the nation!
Er... Please excuse me for what I just said.
I have felt utterly isolated ever since I became the Prime Minister.
Huh? Seriously?
What's wrong?
Freezing up?
Hey
The heck?
Hellooo
Tech difficulty
Say something
Looking at his planner again
Nervous
Actually, that planner's super cute!
Wait, wut?
Srsly?
State of Emergency-
Suga went all out
We will now distribute smart phones free of charge to all Tachikawa citizens!
What does that mean?
He seems weak
Wut?
You can do it if you try
What now?
Wut? How?
The hell?
Someone explain in 3 lines
Wut...?
Srsly?!
We ask that everyone register on GALAX!
Gimme
Gimme all
Why
Gimme!
Where?
What about Hino residents?
Do we have to give them back?
Registering sux
Just take'em all!
Hurry!
Everyone, please register on GALAX, now!
Who doesn't have a smart phone?
Who's having trouble registering?
Prime Minister Sugayama.
Y-Yes? You talking to me?
There is chaos on Itsukaichi-Kaido Avenue due to citizens
trying to flee the city.
Your abilities as Prime Minister are needed.
Me? Needed?
Go, Suga-yan
Go handle it
You're the PM
Hurry up!
You're the only one who can handle it
Go forth, final Hero! Thy name is Sugayan!
All right!
I'm gonna do this!
Rui, eighty-two percent of the citizens have safely evacuated.
Good! We're almost there.
Abandon your vehicles and head to the evacuation zone!
Many of the citizens attempting to leave the city
do not like the riot police's announcements.
Okay!
Give me that for a sec!
Yes, Ma'am.
We understand your desire to leave the city.
However, doing so en masse will cause chaos.
Leaving the city does not necessarily guarantee your safety.
All of us want to reach safety!
Please help us keep you safe!
Huh? How can we trust cops?!
I'm not gonna put up with this!
Prime Minister!
Citizens!
Please follow evacuation orders and remain in the city!
It's the Prime Minister!
Why's he here?
I'm not running anymore!
I will fight with Tachikawa citizens and the Gatchaman!
Please believe in us, and do what we ask!
Citizens!
Have you finished registering on GALAX?
Please look at the icon next to the X button!
What?
What's going on?
If you click that icon,
you will obtain the ability of CROWDS!
To overcome this unprecedented crisis,
all of us need the ability of CROWDS!
They will be the CROWDS of Justice!
Defeat the malicious CROWDS
and restore peace to Tachikawa!
No!
That's not me!
I'm here!
I am Sugayama!
It's Katze.
No!
Stop!
No!
