It's so pretty.
I know.
What's taking Futaro so long?
We're just acquaintances.
When a girl changes her hairstyle, you have to compliment her.
I just got called in for urgent work.
So I can't watch the fireworks.
Besides, y'know, we all look the same. It won't matter if one of us isn't there.
That's a bit of a stretch.
Sorry, someone's waiting for me.
Hey.
Tell me what's going on.
Why?
Why are you going out of your way for us?
Because you're our tutor?
Good question!
Why?
You're right!
Like, objectively speaking, why am I poking my nose into your business?
Okay, well, that's that.
Shoot.
This is bad.
My coworker's here.
I snuck out without letting them know.
I'm going to be in trouble.
Huh?
Wasn't that the guy with you earlier?
Oh, no! He's coming this way!
H-Hey!
Huh?

Down we go.
You're sitting there?!
Hey, how long do we have to keep this up?
Just a little longer, sorry.
I wonder if we look like we're in a relationship.
W-Well, this is Japan, not the west.
I think you'd have to be in a relationship to be in this situation.
We're just friends, though.
I feel like I'm doing something bad.
We're friends?
Um...
I think it'd be a bit much to say we're more than friends after just one hug.
N-No, I mean...
I'm just a teacher for hire.
If it weren't for that, I don't think we would've ever crossed paths.
So it doesn't feel right to call ourselves friends.
What the heck? You're way too fussy.
And here I thought we were friends.
I guess you don't, huh?
That hurts.
No, I...
Back then...
The two of us are friends.
We're just acquaintances.
Did that hurt Miku, too?
Hello?
Yes, I'm sorry.
We just ran into some trouble.
I assure you this won't happen during filming!
Filming?
Is your job...
That guy's actually a cameraman.
I understand.
I work with him.
As a camera assistant?
Yeah.
I try to come up with ways to make a better shot.
It's what I love doing more than anything right now.
Do you really have time for that?
If you girls don't focus on studying, you might not even make it to college.
Why do you study, Futaro-kun?
Why?
Well...
Ichika-chan!
Shoot!
Found you!
What are you doing here?
Come on!
U-Um...
Miku?!
Did he get us mixed up?
Itsuki
Incoming Call
Itsuki? Where are you?
I don't know.
I've gotten lost.
I don't think I can join you for the fireworks.
Don't give me that wimpy talk.
Listen, I'm going to...
I'm not giving up.
The five of us are going to watch the fireworks together!
There.
They're over there.
Have you called her?
I can't get through.
Why did you sneak out of work like that?
I don't want to tell you!
It seems we aren't even friends, anyway.
I know I said that, but...
Why do I even bother to ask?
It doesn't matter to me what they do.
It doesn't matter!
What's your relationship with Ichika-chan?
It's nothing.
You don't need to ask me.
Futaro-kun?
You already have the answer to that question.
Um...
I'm not Ichika.
You're that guy from earlier!
What do you want?!
Who are you to her?!
I'm...
I can't say what we have is a friendship,
but the word I blurted out that day sounds the closest.
I'm her...
I'm their...
partner.
I want them back.
What on earth are you talking about?!
Take a good look. This isn't Ichika.
Um...
I'd never confuse her for anyone else.
She's our precious young actress.
Let go of her!
Two Ichika-chans?!
Young actress?
That's the film work you do?
Yotsuba-san, the fireworks are going to end soon.
Don't worry.
The five of us have different tastes in clothes, food, colors, and stuff,
but we've always been one at heart in the end.
So I'm sure we'll watch fireworks together.
Okay.
Ichika...
Ichika-chan...
An actress?
A quintuplet?!
Seriously?
Seriously?
O-Oh right, we have to get to work.
Let's go, Ichika-chan.
Hold up.
I'm really sorry I got the wrong person.
But Ichika-chan has a really important audition now.
What?
Ichika, are you really ditching the fireworks?
Tell the others I'm sorry.
Let's hurry.
Ichika!
Futaro, go with Ichika.
Miku...
But I can't leave you by yourself here.
I'll be fine now.
Now what?
It looks like you're in a pinch.
Sure does.
Y-You!
Ichika!
Futaro-kun.
Where'd the mustache guy go?
He went to get the car.
You really don't plan to go back?
I'll ask you again, Futaro-kun.
Why are you going out of your way for us when you're just a tutor?
Because we're partners in a cooperative relationship.
A script?
I was recruited by my current boss six months ago.
Ever since, I've been playing minor roles every now and then.
I just got news that there's an audition for a major role in a pretty big movie.
I might finally be making my official debut.
Is that what you want to do?
Yeah.
Hey, since you're here, why don't you be my practice partner?
You're playing the male character.
Why me?
We're in a cooperative relationship, remember?
I'm only going to read the script.
Yay!
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay. If you would.
C-Congratulations on your graduation.
Sensei, thank you for everything.
When I met you in that classroom, for the first time, I...
Sensei,
I'm glad you were my teacher.
I'm glad I was your student.
Huh?
Wait, were you moved by my acting?
I never thought I'd get to hear you say you were glad I was your teacher.
That's what got you?
It's the boss's car.
Okay, see you.
I'm going to go land that role.
Hey.
Stop with that fake smile.
Huh?
You're always doing that.
In the alleyway,
when you were about to leave...
You always smile to hide your true feelings.
It pisses me off.
I said you were my partner, didn't I?
My family's in debt.
I'm tutoring you to pay off that debt.
But the five of you never stop giving me trouble.
I ended up getting paid without anything to show for it.
I at least want to work for what I earn.
That's how I really feel.
That's all.
What about you? You act like you're cool with everything,
so why were you shaking back there?
Having started this job,
I thought I could finally stand tall, as the eldest of the sisters.
I promised myself I wouldn't tell them until I'd actually made it.
So I couldn't tell anyone that I suddenly got this audition
and silently bailed on our fireworks plan.
If I bomb the audition now, I won't know how to face them.
The fireworks are about to end.
But, wow, I can't believe you noticed such a subtle change in me.
Big Sis here is impressed.
Do I really seem that perceptive?
So you're aware that you don't.
There's no way I could notice any little change in you.
I just noticed that your smile wasn't the same as theirs.
You got me.
I can't even fool you? I'm starting to lose confidence here.
Maybe you don't have acting chops.
Wow, that's blunt!
Just so you know, that's better for me.
You'll actually focus on studying and not on distractions.
It's not a distraction.
This is the path I really want to take in life.
Ichika-chan! Hurry up and get in!
O-Okay.
Well, I'll join you when you apologize to them.
We're partners, after all.
Hello?
Raiha?
Can you put Yotsuba on?
Thank you, everyone.
That's it for today's auditions.
We'll announce the results on a later...
Sorry I'm late.
I'm Nakano Ichika.
Yotsuba? Where the hell are you?!
He said what?
Hello? Yotsuba?
Uesugi-kun did?
Okay, are you ready?
Yes. Thank you for having me.
Congratulations on your graduation.
Sensei,
thank you for everything.
When I met you in that classroom, for the first time, I...
I hope I'm smiling properly.
How would the others do it if they were here?
Yotsuba would be like...
Miku would be like...
Itsuki would be like...
Nino would be like...
I'm glad you were my teacher.
I'm glad I was your student.
That concludes the 14th Annual Fall Fireworks Festival.
He's totally conked out with his eyes open.
Scary.
Is the audition over?
Yeah.
Thanks.
I must say, I never thought Ichika-chan could be so expressive.
You must be the one who pulled it out of her.
I'm personally becoming interested in you, too.
Smooch.
Huh?
Ichika-chan?
Where are we going, Futaro-kun?
A park nearby.
They're waiting.
They must be angry with me for missing the fireworks.
Yeah.
But...
It's a bit too early to give up.
Although this isn't as impressive as the fireworks show earlier.
We're all set, Uesugi-san!
We couldn't wait, so we got started.
I'm glad you bought those fireworks.
Thanks.
You took care of Raiha for me, too.
It's nothing.
If anything, she was taking care of me.
You.
I heard you left Itsuki behind and wandered away.
She was nearly in tears.
Nino, I told you to keep that a secret!
S-Sorry.
I need to give you a piece of my mind.
How misleading!
Itsuki...
Join us for the fireworks, Itsuki.
Miku,
could you grab those fireworks over there?
Okay.
Here.
You seem kind of distant.
Well, let's get started, then.
Everyone...
Sorry.
It's my fault that things ended up like this.
I'm really sorry.
You don't need to apologize so much.
I mean, she's actually sorry.
No kidding.
Why didn't you contact us?
You're the main cause of what happened today.
But also, it was my fault for forgetting to tell you where we were going.
I'm sickened by my awful sense of direction.
I screwed up a lot, too.
I don't know what's going on, but I'm sorry, too.
I got distracted by all the food stalls.
Girls...
Here. This is yours.
Remember what Mom always said?
If one of us messes up, the five of us overcome it together.
If one of us finds happiness, the five of us share it.
Whether in happiness...
We are five fifths, and together we are one.
Wait a second.
They're enjoying the fireworks.
Raiha is happily sleeping.
I can go home now, can't I?
It's gotten really late, but it's time to go back to studying.
Here we go!
What a lame firework.
I guess I'll stick around a bit longer.
Five more to go.
Let's all choose the one we want.
Ready, and...
Yeah!
This one.
We chose the same one? That doesn't happen often.
I'll take this one.
You can't let go of that one, can you?
We're partners.
Miku.
These flashy ones are more fun than the sparklers.
I like this one.
You really like that one, huh?
Yeah, I do.
I haven't thanked you yet.
I have to cooperate with you to repay you for your support today.
We're partners, after all.
But don't think you're going to have an easy time with me.
You'd better be ready.
Sheesh.
You did well.
Thanks.
Good night for now.
Next Time on The Quintessential Quintuplets
Quintuplet Trivia!
Ichika's the most popular of the five of us.
I wonder if it's because she gives off a cool beauty vibe.
That's not true.
I'm sure you're popular too, Yotsuba.
Of the five of us, I think you're in the top five most popular.
Yay!
