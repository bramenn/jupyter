Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Unforgivable!
What's unforgivable?
Taking advantage of what everyone longs for, a white wedding dress,
and tainting the eternal dream of innocent girls
is absolutely unforgivable!
In the name of the moon, Sailor Moon will punish you!
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute yume no naka nara ieru
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen ima sugu aitai yo

I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like a super heroine, but I am!
As you know, I transform myself by using a peculiar brooch
and fight against bad guys.
I'm the sailor warrior of love and justice, Sailor Moon!
And my friends are the smart and sweet Ami Mizuno,
and a slightly quick-tempered psychic girl, Rei Hino.
Both of them are so dependable, I feel like I'll fall behind.
But anyway, I just have to do my best!

This is how you make darts.
Another chocolate parfait, please.
I wonder what's the matter with Ms. Akiyama?
I can't stand it. It's because of that home economics class.
I'm so sleepy.
Ms. Akiyama used to be so enthusiastic about sewing.
It is because...
Why are you always showing up from the least expected places?!
The reason Ms. Higure Akiyama is acting weird...
Engagement?!
Yes! Higure Akiyama, 34 years old and still single.
Ms. Akiyama has wished with all her heart to get married
and her greatest dream of her life is to have a luxurious wedding
in a wedding dress that she made herself.
Higure, I'm a dull business man
with no status or savings,
and I'm not tall at all either.
I cannot give you a very big wedding reception,
but will you... but will you marry me?
Yes.
He may not be what you'd call ideal,
but as long as there's love...
That's being soft! Always have high, limitless ideals!
If there's a handsome guy, I'll go after him and catch him!
My goal is to get married before I turn 25!
Miss Usagi, you don't mean that!
Ms. Akiyama!
Ms. Sakurada...
What are you doing?
Oh, were you thinking about your fiance?
Oh, no...
Wow! This silk is beautiful!
Didn't you say you were going to
sew your own wedding dress for the ceremony?
Yes, but I haven't been able to find a silk cloth that I like,
even though I already have the design for it.
Hang in there!
You absolutely must complete a fabulous wedding gown
and have a wonderful ceremony!
After all, I'm counting on meeting my future husband
at your wedding reception!
Okay, I'll do my best.
I better work hard, too!
The stars know everything.
The star Vega...
The tears of Lyra's Vega fill the heavens,
but they cannot cross the vast Milky Way.
The woman about to shine her brightest under the light of Vega
is Higure Akiyama.
I know who my next target is!

It's so wonderful! Please be happy!

A bride! She looks great!

No, no. Bring it more this way!

Handmade Wedding Dress Contest Grand Prize: A Free Wedding Reception First Prize: VCR Deck Second Prize: CD Player Rei, what's going on?!
Rei, what's going on?!
A handmade wedding dress contest...
So, your name is Rei?
Yes!
Oh, dear...
I didn't know Usagi had a nice friend like you!
Oh, yes! We go to different schools,
but we are very good friends!
How can she say that? She just followed me home.
That's my cake!
Usagi! She's just unbelievable sometimes.
Go ahead, please help yourself.
Wow! Thank you! Go ahead, please help yourself.
Wow! Thank you!
What's going on, Usagi?
I don't know!
Your homemade cake is delicious!
You must be a wonderful cook!
Oh, my!
You goody two shoes! One look, and you can tell it's from
the cake store in front of the train station! Ouch!
That hurt!
Usagi is one lucky girl!
You are such a wonderful mother,
you must also be good at sewing, right?
What?!
It has always been my dream to learn sewing
from somebody wonderful like you!
For example, sewing a wedding dress.
Sewing, you say?
Thank you for having me!
If she's not good at sewing, why didn't you just tell me so earlier?!
Hey! So, you were planning on making my mom help you
and participate in that wedding dress contest, weren't you?!
Why you little, dirty, lying, sneaky, tramp!
You're unbelievable! If you have time for a contest like that,
I wish you'd train yourself more
in preparation for the monsters' next move!
You too, Usagi!
Huh? What? Hey, Usagi!
A wedding dress contest?
That's right. And Rei's talking about participating too!
Ami, doesn't that get on your nerves?!
Not really. I don't have any plans to get married anyway.
Don't you get it? It's a dream! A dream! Every girl's dream!
Hey, Ami, I know you get good grades in home economics.
Teach me how to sew?
Well, if you really want me to.
Yay! I'm not gonna lose to that Rei!
What?!
If you want to learn the basics, these should get you started.
The actual sewing lessons will come after that.
Ami, you're something else...
It's mine! No, it's mine! Don't! I'm first! No, you're not!
I'm the one who'll win the contest! No, I am!
I got this first!
No, I was first!
Ms. Haruna... No, I was first!
Ms. Haruna...
Oh, this silk is...
Beautiful.
It is very beautiful.
Excuse me?
This is a wonderful silk.
A silk worthy of becoming your wedding dress.
Oh, I can just see you standing under a sky full of stars
and walking along a shoreline.
Every star is sure to sparkle and bestow their blessing upon you.
Here.
I wish you happiness.
A grand wedding reception for free?!
I didn't know that.
See? Naru, that's why I have to enter the contest!
Don't you think so?
I get it now.
You nod off all the time during home economics,
but you even visited Ms. Akiyama at her home to ask her about sewing.
I knew something fishy was going on.
Because I just don't know what to do.
But making a dress isn't that easy, you know.
Not to mention your short attention span.
I'll be fine!
After all, they say, A woman's conviction can crack a rock.
What does that mean?
Oh? Did I get that saying wrong? What does that mean?
Oh? Did I get that saying wrong?
What the heck is she up to?
Juban Heights Hey, who is the guy?
Juban Heights He and the bouquet don't go well together.
He and the bouquet don't go well together.
He looks like a loser.
You shouldn't say things like that.
He's visiting Ms. Akiyama's apartment!
Don't tell me that's...
Ms. Akiyama's fiance?!
Miss Higure?
What's wrong? You won't even answer my calls.
Are you feeling okay?
Miss Higure?
What? Miss Higure?
Well, I...
What is this?!
Listen carefully!
Don't come near my place until the dress contest at Juban Hall is over!
If you do, I'll break off our engagement! Got that?
The dress... The dress... I have to hurry up and make my wedding dress!
Miss Higure...
No way! That was our Ms. Akiyama?!
By the contest, did she mean...
She can't be! It'll be a really tough competition if she participates, too!
This can't be happening!
I'm in trouble!
You know...
I sense something's wrong with that teacher.
What?! Our home economics teacher, Ms. Akiyama?
Yes, I definitely feel the aura of a monster, but it's not clear.
Come to think of it, Ms. Akiyama has been gone for a while.
See? So, we need to get the help of Rei's powers, and everyone...
Hey! Stop!
What are you going to do with the only rental wedding kimono we have?!
Hey!
Ouch!
Honestly! I thought you were going to elope with some guy!
I hope you're not...
Oh, you still don't trust me!
There is no way that I will participate
in that Juban Hall contest!
Of course, not!
It's unforgivable to use a sacred wedding dress for their promotion.
Shame on them!
Why is he so mad?
Excuse me dear,
how about having your wedding ceremony at our shrine?
It's much cheaper than having it at Juban Hall.
No, thank you. I don't have anybody right now anyway.
Ooh! I'm single! If you'll take me...
Here I am. The beautiful thief, Usagi Hood.
It's perfect!
Usagi! It's perfect!
Usagi!
I hope you're not planning on using
my favorite curtains to make a dress!
Please have mercy, Governor Tsukino!
I'd love to buy the cloth for a dress, but my allowance...
Mom!
Here is my proposition.
Huh? Here is my proposition.
Huh? To pay for the price of new curtains,
To pay for the price of new curtains,
I will suspend your allowance for the next three months.
Governor Tsukino!
Besides, there aren't that many days left until the contest.
Can you get a dress done by then?!
But the grand wedding reception...
I just can't give it up!
Juban Hall Ladies, thank you for participating in this contest!
Thank you, thank you so much!
It's a huge success! Huge!
It's a huge success! Huge!
I wish I could...
Don't cry, Usagi. You did your best. I wish I could...
Don't cry, Usagi. You did your best.
Well, I'll acknowledge the effort
you put into stabbing your fingers with a needle over and over again!
Rei!
Anyway, we need to watch and see if anything suspicious happens.
Usagi, you're going to infiltrate the hall as a contestant.
You meanie! You know I don't have a dress!
You have the transforming pen, don't you?
Oh! I'd forgotten about that.
Moon Power! Turn me into a beautiful bride!
I did it!
How do I look?
I could win for sure with this!
Don't you wish you were me?
Usagi! Don't you wish you were me?
Usagi!
You wouldn't win fairly.
You're only participating, okay?!
I knew it.
Ladies and gentlemen!

I can't believe he was still waiting for her
after all the things she said to him.
Well, I guess you can't judge a man by his looks.
But I still prefer a good looking guy!
Hey, Usagi!
Did you know that the person who catches
the bride's bouquet will get to marry next?
What?!
Really?!
It's mine!
No, it's mine!
No, I'll be the first!
