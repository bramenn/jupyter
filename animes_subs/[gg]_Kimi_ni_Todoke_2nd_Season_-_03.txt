Forget About It
Now it's May.
Everything is bright and green.
I considered myself the closest to you out of all of the guys.
But that's not necessarily true.
What did he mean by that?
How should I have responded to that?
I still can't stop thinking about it.
K-Kazehaya only said that to me out of kindness,
but I overreacted and responded to him with...
That was so rude of me!
Man, he's so thick. He didn't even wait for you!
Seriously. Maybe it's all in my head.
It must be because of how he compliments you!
Maybe I really am... creepy.
I want to have a natural relationship with Kazehaya... Like before.
But now I don't remember what that was like.
Hey, Kazehaya!
Are you doing anything during lunch break today?
It's so nice out I thought I'd go play soccer.
I'll show you my bicycle kick!
Kazehaya and his buddies are going out to play soccer again?
Hey Nakai, Negishi. Why don't you guys play with us?
What?
Really? You sure?
You guys are on the soccer team!
I bet you guys are really good.
Teach us how to head the ball!
Sure, of course!
Awesome!
Morning, Kuronuma.
Okay, be nice and friendly, natural...
M-Morning.
Kazehaya?
What's up?
Kazehaya treated me the same way he treats everyone...
Wow. I guess that's why he's known as Mr. Lively.
It's hard not to stare after being greeted with such a beaming smile.
What are you talking about?
Good morning, Sadako.
H-He's being so nice and friendly and normal this morning too!
G-Good mo
No good, no good. You look so tense.
Morning
Morning?
Your forehead!
MORNING!
No, more like this.
Morninggg!
Okay, your turn.
MoRn
Morninggg!!!
They're at it again.
Morning
He just doesn't quit.
Morning!
MORNING!
Mooorning!
MorninG!
What a pair.
What is it?
Nothing.
Even if we think of it as kindness,
that kindness means something completely different to Kazehaya than it does to me.
Ow, my stomach hurts...
I've been kind of constipated lately...
That sucks.
Huh?
Where'd Sawako go?
Maybe the bathroom?
This is good for constipation...
That plant?
What should I do with that?
There she goes again.
Shota?
Ready?
Did something happen?
You've been kinda down lately.
Have I?
Yeah.
Alright, next!
We're in a new class now.
I thought maybe it was normal to say something like that to help her get used to the new class.
But I made her even more uncomfortable instead.
Who?
Kuronuma.
Something like that...
What exactly did you
I don't wanna talk about it.
So selfish.
That's right.
Deep down, I'm pretty selfish, possessive, and like things my way.
And quick tempered.
That's why I'm just about out of patience.
I know it'll be difficult for her, but I really want to stop beating around the bush.
This...
is your idea of patience?
But it's not like I want to make things difficult for her.
I've tried so hard to get this far.
But doesn't she like you too?
Well, she doesn't dislike me.
He didn't
He got (courtesy) chocolate
Kazehaya is just so lively!
I admire him so much!
And respect him!
But that's it!
What part of me is lively? Jeez!
No one said that.
Are you in some sort of rush?
Yeah.
Someone else might have their eyes on her too.
When I think of someone else being with her...
It bothers me.
Is she really that attractive?
She looks like a traditional Japanese doll to me...
I don't really get it, but hang in there.
That isn't very comforting.
Sawako, where are you going?
Would you mind coming with me?
Detox
Insomnia
What are these signs for?
I thought it might be helpful to let everyone know what they do!
Detox
Constipation Diarrhea
I-I see. Don't you normally write the name of the plant?
Detox
I thought it'd be easier to understand if I wrote what they're used for.
Hair Loss
It seems more like these plants will cause what's written!
Huh?
Plants and signs from The Curse!
What if I wrote affects or for on them?
Diuresis
For
That's so small.
For diuresis?
Kent!
Wow, you all called me by first name!
I'm so happy.
Kazehaya suddenly came to mind.
I was hoping
You were hoping someone would visit you, right, Sadako?
Someone you like?
I'm such a psychic.
A p-psychic!
Not only does he act natural,
not only is he friendly,
but he's a psychic too!
Your face looks strained!
I told you that girls shouldn't make faces like that!
I'm a philanthropist, so when a girl looks like she's abandoning everything that makes girls happy,
I just can't ignore her.
Wh-Who does he think he is?
Abandoning?
Let's see...
Alright! When I do this, you smile!
Wh-What was that? Did I really just see that?
And she has such a great role model like you to look up to, right, Ayane?
Thanks. Now get out of my face.
And you, Yoshida, have a fine pair of legs.
Right, Sadako?
Wow, it looks like she's straining her face.
Hey, can you stop forcing her to smile?
It's scary.
Strained
Scary
Teacher?!
Teacher, huh?
That has a nice ring to it.
I'll do my best, Psychic Teacher!
Your forehead again!
Let's split up the psychic and teacher parts.
What does this guy want?
Kent!
Hey, it's been a while.
How's your new class?
Are there any cute girls?
I don't know if I'd call her cute, but there's someone who interests me.
Really? Tell us about her!
She's dark and super tense!
What?
What's your deal?
Hey Ayane.
What are you planning?
Planning?
Me? What makes you think that?
You sure are making a lot of passes at Sawako.
But doesn't Sawako like Kazehaya?
So she does.
Hey, don't do something uncalled-for, got it?
This is a really crucial time for her.
Crucial time?
It's okay. I'm a good guy.
See you.
Is it really okay?
This will be on the midterm!
Man, midterms already?
That was fast.
I heard that Sadako's cursed notes were passed around freshman year in class D!
They weren't cursed. Our class average was really high thanks to those notes.
What, seriously?
Yeah, seriously!
What was that?
On the midterm, Sadako's cursed notes cursed you into getting a high score!
No, no, that's not it
Boys! This will be on the midterm!
What are you guys talking about?
Sadako's notes really helped us on last year's midterm.
Wow, you're really good at academics!
Good?
This is kind of important...
Hey guys, Sadako said that she'd hold a crash course for the midterm after school today!
C-Crash course?!
I-I'm going to do something that crazy?
You'll do it, right, Sadako?
We're in the middle of class at the moment...
If you don't mind me doing it...
I can even tell around three ghost stories now!
I wonder if I can live up to their expectations?
I don't think anyone's expecting you to tell ghost stories.
Wow, four people came!
Sawako, you...
I'm really need this crash course!
Yeah!
Kent ain't coming even though he announced it?
Have you guys started already?
We're just about to.
Oh good. I just made it!
Kazehaya came too.
We're here!
We just finished cleaning.
Thanks, Sadako!
N-No, thank you!
You're really doing it?
Takahashi!
I asked Kazehaya about it earlier.
Where's Ryu?
Baseball practice.
Kazehaya told her...
Hey, Sadako?
I don't know if I can help,
but I'll do my best.
Wow, that's a pretty big group.
Yeah. Kazehaya was telling people about it earlier.
Mr. Lively?
They say he can't ignore people who need help fitting in.
So that's it.
You'll come too, right, Tsuru?
First, for this section, what you need to do is remember the formula.
What was that? I can't see!
Sadako, use the blackboard.
B-Black
Great idea!
That'll make taking notes much easier.
You heard them. Get going!
O-Okay!
I-I got it!
The answer is...
2 root 5!
The dunce duo got it!
Because it's easy to get now!
You're amazing, Sadako!
It's time, Sadako!
I've never seen her smile before!
Even Sadako smiles!
When Sadako smiles, it means good fortune is on the way!
I've seen it before!
I've seen it countless times before!
This is a competition?
Wow, that was great.
And we understand the problems now too.
I'm so glad we came to this review!
Bye!
Thanks, Sadako!
Teach us again, okay?
Thank you!
Th-Thanks for coming!
Thanks!
Sadako.
You worked really hard to do something outside of your comfort zone.
Thank you very much, Teacher!
What is this?
It ain't impossible. Definitely ain't.
Ant?
Sorry. Think you can go without me?
I have something important to take care of.
Kuronuma.
Do you have a moment?
Sawako, we're in a bit of a hurry.
You said you wanted to do a safety inspection, right?
Oh yeah!
We're gonna take off, Sawako.
Today, I'll thank him more naturally and like a friend.
U-Um!
I interrupted him!
It's okay. You go first.
I'm sorry.
I-I just... wanted to say thank you for today.
I want to be able to thank him better, but I just can't do it.
Even though he made me so happy...
I don't think standing up there in front of people is my thing, but I
I do.
Huh?
I think you have a knack for teaching.
I never, ever want Kazehaya to hate me.
Oh, and about what I said that day...
You don't need to worry about it.
Forget about it.
Hey.
I was waiting for you.
douka ima dake wa furimukanaide
Please don't look at me right now
yuugure sawagu kaze
The sun's set, the wind's blowing,

and we're so close that we can almost touch

My gaze has always been fixed on you

I like you

I've always liked you

I don't mind if this emotion is what they call love,

and I don't care if I get hurt by it

I just want to tell you, over and over again
kimi ni todoke
I want to reach you
