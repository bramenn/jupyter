The voice calling, come now, wake up
Yonde iru koe saa me o samashite
Nakigao nugutte
Wiping a tearstained face
Mabushii hikari kigi no tsuyu umareru
Dare mo shiranai himitsu no mizube de
Odore inochi no pa du duu
Kyou mo yume miteru
Sore wa yasashiku hageshii nagare ne
Doko made tsuzuku rabirinsu
Watashi wa yukou
Nigirishimeru yume
The brilliant light and the dew on trees are born
By the secret water's edge that no one knows of
Dance the pas de deux of life
Dreaming again today
It is a gentle, yet fierce current
How far does the labyrinth stretch?
I shall go
The dream I hold tight
