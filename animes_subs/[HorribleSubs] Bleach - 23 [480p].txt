Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
Huh!
Hey...
Hey! What time is it?!
This is bad, Big Brother! It's nine already!
N-No!
Come on! Bonnie!
But we don't have time today! Hurry and let me ride you!
Hold it! You're running away?!
Who's running away?!
Hey Dandelion!
We'll settle this for sure tomorrow!
So you just wait there until then!
Now don't you go floating away like cotton!
Let's go, everyone!
Huh?!
Cut the crap! That's my-!
They're gone.
That was a disaster I'm speechless.
Dammit! Just who the hell is he?!
I wonder if Jidanbo is all right?
The wound has closed up, but
Big-bodied men have lots of stamina.
I'm sure he'll be okay.
You're right.
He's so big and so strong. I'm sure he'll be okay.
Still Who is this Kukaku Shiba we're going to meet now?
Yoruichi never gives us any details
It's probably someone he knows
who can get us to Seireitei without passing through the gates, right?
Probably, someone who is famous for his skill.
Oh! It must be a cat with pedigree papers!
Like a Persian cat
Or an American Short Hair or a Dalmatian.
Inoue
It doesn't mean it'll be a cat just because Yoruichi knows him.
Alsoa Dalmatian
is a dog!
A dog?
Judging from the name,
he's probably a well-built man, someone like a samurai.
No, he'll be an old hermit-type master.
I know!
See? Like this and this and
Done!
A hermit-like macho samurai with cat ears, and a tail!
No doubt about it!
I can't tell what you drew
Oh? Then how about a skinny guitar-wielding samurai?
You don't understand, Inoue. He has to have a cape.
Oh shucks!
But Kurosaki is late.
Shall I call him?
No, I'll go see.
Now then, I have to think up the next Kukaku Shiba!
Noyou don't have to think.
Huh?
What?!
Not going?!
Not not going. Just go on ahead.
I'm going to finish the fight with that guy from yesterday!
What are you saying?!
Quit joking aroundand come!
No! No!
He'll think I ran away!
So what?!
Hey, hey
Aren't we going yet?
Inoue!
Help me drag this fool away from here!
W-Who's the fool?!
I'm gonna beat him up quickly as soon as he shows up,
and I'll come after you, so go on-!
Has blood gone to your head and made you forget your purpose here?
Fool!
Rukia's life depends on this journey.
Surely, you haven't forgotten.
You can't waste time just to see who's more stubborn!
If you understand, get ready!
What is it...Renji?
Did they move up my execution date?
It's less than 14 days to the execution.
The use of Sokyoku has been granted.
You're being transferred to Shishinro, Repentance Cell.
Hey
Looks like we've come to the edge of a village.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Hey!
Shut up! According to the map the Elder gave us,
it's supposed to be around here.
If you have any complaints, you take the lead!
No, I'm not complaining.
Kukaku Shiba probably wants to keep his identity a secret,
that's why he lives in a place like this.
Unfortunately, that is not the case.
It's just that person's nature and personal preference.
Don't worry.
This person moves around quite a bit,
but the house is always built the same.
Once you see it, youll recognize it.
Once you see it, huh?
Yes, yes. Just once
Oh, I see it!
There it is.
Wha-!
What's this?!
Wow! How neat!
Kukaku Shiba
See? You can recognize it at once.
That's not the problem anymore!
Wants to keep his identity a secret? That's probably a lie!
He's probably not allowed to live in town
because he builds houses like that!
That's gotta be it!
Hmm So this time, it's human arms holding the banner.
It's pretty neatly done.
Each time
He changes the motif?
Let's go.
Okay!
Arghwe're going to that embarrassing house right now?!
I don't want to be seen walking into a house like that!
What's the matter? Hurry up!
Yes.
Yes.
Hey Ishida! I know you don't want to go, but hurry up!
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that chimney? It's awfully big compared to the house.
It looks like the opening is closed up. What the?
Hold it!
Huh?
Who goes there?!
Strangers! And one is a Soul Reaper!
Suspicious characters!
I, Koganehiko
And Shiroganehiko
will not allow you to pass!
will not allow you to pass!
Be gone!
Or you'll die right here!
Damn! Not gatekeepers again?!
What a pain this Soul Society is!
Huh?
Huh?
Master Yoruichi!
A descending stairway as soon as you enter?
This house really is weird.
I wonder how you get upstairs?
Please pardon us!
We did not know it was you, Yoruichi, and your companions.
Please forgive our rudeness.
We're not his companions.
That's all right. It's my fault for not notifying you beforehand.
Thank you! Such generous words from such a great personage!
Please wait here a moment.
Y-Yes!
Yes, right awayMaster Kukaku!
It's been a while, Yoruichi.
K-Kukaku is
A woman?!
A woman?!
I never said it was a man.
Huh?
Who are those kids?
Actually, Kukaku
I have a favor to ask of you.
That's usually the case when you look me up.
Is it a difficult problem?
Most likely.
It's been a long time since we've talked like this
All right. Tell me, I love difficult things.
Can you see it, Rukia?
From that window over there?
The two tools which will be used for your execution.
That is the Sokyoku.
A prisoner who is held in this tower
can look out the window that has been placed in the tower,
and gaze out at the Sokyoku and repent his sins.
That is why this is called the Repentance Cell.
Your hands
Release!
Thank you for transferring the prisoner here.
Let us go.
Yes.
Lieutenant Abarai
Huh?
Lieutenant!
You already heard that there were Ryoka in Soul Society yesterday?
Five of them
And one of them wielded a sword as long as his body.
A Soul Reaper with orange-colored hair.
Huh?!
I see I get the picture.
All right, I'll take on the job.
Really?
Yeah.
If Urahara is involved, I can't refuse even if I wanted to.
However, while I trust you I don't trust those kids.
I'll include my henchman to keep an eye on them.
Henchman?
Yeah. Henchman, but he's actually my kid brother.
He's still a brat and not that useful.
Hey, are you ready?
Ohjust a minute.
I'm opening the door, so behave!
Y-Yeah!
How do you do?! My name is Ganju Shiba!
Please be good to me!
What? You know each other?
How many days has it been since I saw her face looking so alive?
Ichimaru was the one who confronted them,
so that kid probably isn't alive.
I was probably right not to tell her.
Hey!
Huh?
Hey, it's been awhile, Abarai.
Aizen-san!
Can you talk?
Well
It's been quite some time since we talked like this.
Yes.
Since you were sent to Kenpachi's place.
How many years has it been?
You're with the Squad 6 now?
Errwhat did you want to talk to me about?
Abarai, you and her you were close to Rukia Kuchiki, right?
Don't deny it.
I heard you were chums from the old days in Rukon District.
Yes
I won't waste any time then.
In your eyes, should she die?
No I don't understand your question.
Don't you think it's strange?
Her crime was the unauthorized transfer, and loss, of her spiritual energy,
and staying longer than allowed outside.
Certainly, heavy crimes, but the problem is how to deal with them.
The order for immediate return and disposal of her Gigai.
The lessening of the grace period from 35 days to 25 days,
and the use of the Sokyoku on one who is ranked below a captain.
They're all outside the norm.
I have a feeling that this is the will of one person.
Hold it, Captain. What do you mean?!
I have a bad feeling.
Abarai, I may
Attention all captains! Attention all captains!
An urgent meeting will now be held! Repeat!
Why you-!
Lucky!
What-?!
Why you-!
How's that?!
Now I'm mad!
You bastard!
Why you-!
Did she have to go that far to stop them?
I think I know why she always moves.
It must be hard.
What's with you?!
Fighting from the minute you set eyes on each other
Don't you know it's dangerous?!
You destroyed my house!
Hey!
But Sis...
No excuses!
Any complaints?!
Errno!
No!
What's with this? Both brother and sister
Huh?!
Hey brat!
This is my house!
If you have a problem about the way I do things, get outta here!
I-I'm sorry.
Okay. As long as you understand.
Your sister is something else.
I know.
All right. Everyone, stand!
Yes!
Yes!
Koganehiko, go outside with Shiroganehiko and start the preparations.
Right!
The rest, be quiet and follow me!
Wowwhy is there light when we're underground?
I didn't see any generators.
I keep hotaru-kazura in the ceiling cracks and
on both sides of the wooden frames.
Hotaru-kazura?
Is that a plant or something that is only found in Soul Society?
We're here. This is it.
Um
Open it, Ganju.
Right!
Umm!
What's the big idea?!
Don't defy her! Okay?
Heave!
W-What is this?!
It's huge!
I'll shoot you guys into Seireitei with this.
From the sky.
Sky?!
Sky?!
My name is Kukaku Shiba. I'm the best pyrotechnic in Rukongai!
With much appreciation
send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I dont know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move
hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
Youre not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
This is the Special Hard Spiritual Partition Penetration Device
which my sister invented that can break through the barrier
which surrounds the entire Seireitei
and which is made from the Sekki-Seki
which breaks down spiritual energy completely.
Oh... Can you repeat that?
Forget it!
