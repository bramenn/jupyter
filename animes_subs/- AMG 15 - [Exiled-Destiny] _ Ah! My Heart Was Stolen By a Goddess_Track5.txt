Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
Big Sister! Guess what? Guess what?
Let's see, now I have to...
Hey, Belldandy, we should be leaving soon.
All right.
I'm sorry, Skuld. I've got to go to college now.
Okay.
All right, we're off now.
Have a good day.
See you later!
Just you wait! No way am I going to be defeated by that Keiichi!
I'll make sure Big Sister has eyes for no one but me!
Ah! A Heart Stolen by a Goddess?
When I'm finished building this, I just know it will make Big Sister happy!
And if that happens...
Thank you, Skuld!
You're the most important person in my life after all!
It's not a big deal, being forced to organize all the professor's data...
Just one more push, huh?
All right!
His steel body is expanding.
Get on your feet! This gets me pumped up!
Big Z! Let's go! Expanding with one injection!
Come on, Big Z! You're at Unit 5!
One more shot! One more shot!
An all-purpose robot who will protect and serve Big Sister with its devotion...
With this on our side, we have nothing to fear from Marller either!
And that's all she wrote.
Finished!
Okay, I guess I should hit Save...
Alternate power source on! Voltage is normal...
Start data read!
Let's go, you got him! Finish him off!
Gyro on.
Now releasing the final safety device.
Voltage, okay! Oil pressure, normal!
Here we go!
Activate!
It's all gone...
All 15 hours and 22 minutes of my hard work...
Just when Big Z was about to wreak total havoc...
Only one person could've done this... it's that girl!
What in the world were you thinking?
What are you going to do about all that data?
Your timing is perfect, you know.
I just activated him.
This is the multi-functional Big Sister Helper Robot, which I invented.
He handles all household chores and has a demon-thwarting function.
He's an all-purpose robot and his name is...
Banpei RX!
What's the matter?
I can't believe you made another useless piece of junk!
I can't believe my data was lost because of this...
I missed the part where Big Z goes on a rampage because of you!
How are you gonna make up for it?
15 hours and 22 minutes worth of work went down the drain for this?
This robot I built... he really is useful, he is!
Oh, hey, sorry. I was too harsh.
You watch, he's incredible! Banpei is absolutely incredible!
Oh, you're such a crybaby.
What's the matter?
PROTECT THE TARGET SET/COMPLETED
I did it! Activation successful!
Who is that, a new friend?
It's nothing but a piece of junk that Skuld created.
Forgive me! You're not a piece of junk, all right?
Huh?
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Banpei! I'd like to be your friend!
My, are you going to help me?
No sign of vigilance whatsoever!
Little do they know what a terrible plan I have up my sleeve!
I'll force that Keiichi to take this maximum strength hair-growth potion...
Wait, should I go with the potion that will make his skin...
Or maybe it's better to use this one?
It feels so good to do the laundry on a sunny day.
When I look at that blue sky and those white clouds...
I don't know why, but...
I've decided! I'll use this potion that will make his feet itch for 30 years!
Banpei?
ATTACK MODE
ATTACK MODE DEMON/AUTOMATIC
Marller!
Was Marller here?
Yes.
And we were saved by this little fellow.
You see? He's useful, just like I said!
Right, Big Sister?
Right.
Thank you, Skuld!
Yes, well done indeed. So... Thank you, Skuld!
Yes, well done indeed. So...
Please turn it off as soon as possible.
'The Galaxy Vagabond Force' is about to start.
Rats!
Come on, we just got rid of Marller. Why do I have to get yelled at?
But I guess it doesn't matter, since I made Big Sister happy.
Okay, now I'm set to re-organize all that data...
Deromasa Hankachou at two is an absolute must-see!
Thank you for guarding the door.
STANDBY MODE
Oh, my, is he powered down?
I feel sorry for him for not being able to move.
Was this the switch?
My data's gone again!
Deromasa's love scene!
Please, stop powering on that thing.
I don't care if it's you, I won't have it!
The next time it happens, I'll trash it!
Would you mind activating it while we're at school?
I'm so sorry.
Big Sister...
It's all right, Banpei.
You have a purpose in life, too.
That's why you were brought into this world.
Everything in this world is born out of necessity.
So you have nothing to worry about. All right?
Isn't that right, Skuld?
Yes.
I'm going to try to insert a booster circuit.
If it works, he'll be able to operate on half the amount of electricity.
It will work.
And I'm sure that Banpei will appreciate how much you care.
Is there anything I can do to help?
No...
Since I'm the one who built Banpei, I want you to let me finish the job on my own.
In that case, let me bring you the ice cream I made yesterday!
Please have some!
Done!
Please, please work...
This should work.
He moved!
The lights didn't go out, either! We did it!
Huh? Is the power gonna be okay?
Hey, what's the big idea, Keiichi!
Are you all right?
Get away from her right now!
Sorry!
ATTACK MODE NORMAL
Hey, what's this?
Stay away from me!
Thank goodness... he's got a power cord...
He's not programmed to attack people.
That might be true, but he sure wasn't trying to be friends just now.
I wonder what happened to him...
Hey! I wonder what happened to him...
The data's been rewritten to make him protect Big Sister...
What did you say?
According to the log, he used the booster circuit to rewrite the data himself.
Why would he do that?
I don't know.
But I'm sure there must be some kind of reason.
We might be able to pinpoint the reason if we power him on again.
ATTACK MODE NORMAL
Not again!
Keiichi, will he be all right?
Oh, I'm sure he'll figure it out somehow...
Oh, don't tell me...
Oh, my...thank you!
AUDIO: REPLAY Thank you!
AUDIO: REPLAY
AUDIO: REPLAY Thank you...thank you!
Stay back, stay back!
Now, now. You know that's wrong.
After all, Skuld is the person who created you.
Skuld, Keiichi, and Urd are all important to me.
So please, try to get along with them.
MEMORY SAVE
Boy, can you believe it? That's MY Big Sister he stole!
Can't you do something about it? You made it yourself, right?
Do what about it, though?
So you brought us some ice cream?
After monopolizing MY Big Sister all day!
You'll have to try harder to fool me!
Maybe he's starting to warm up to us?
No, there's no way! Maybe he's starting to warm up to us?
Anyway, he just won't leave Belldandy's side, will he?
How did that happen?
Idiot, it's so obvious!
Huh?
Love.
What?
That's the one conclusion I never wanted to utter myself...
Ah no, there's no mistake.
Didn't you see his eyes?
But I never installed any emotion circuits.
Belldandy has something inside her that no one will ever understand.
It's a power that draws everyone to her, whether human or object.
This is lunch.
You pour your soul into making lunch for those who are dear to you.
I hope you'll be modified someday so that you can eat, too.
Oh, it's the phone.
Today's the day for sure!
Hello?
Who is this?
I'll spike your lunch with this potion, and a beanstalk will grow from your nostrils!
You moron. As if I'd fall for the same tactic over and over!
What the...
Marller!
Hey, that's my Big Sister's lunch box! You give it back!
Hey, you! Don't you dare treat me like a child!
You old nag demon!
What did you say? You old nag demon!
What did you say?
If you're going to go that far, I think I'll take you on...
Gotcha!
Humph! That the best you can do?
Banpei!
Not that meddlesome thing again!
It's been three minutes and you still haven't answered me.
Maybe you're taking a little nap now, since it's so nice out today?
Well, I can understand that! This is the perfect day to take a nap.
Oh, my, there's some kind of commotion going on outside.
You...
Take that!
You're not going to get the best of me!
Hey! Listen, you, stay out of my way!
What's going on?
You're going to help me out?
Banpei!
Banpei, just do exactly as I say.
What a little brat!
Take that!
As if I'd fall for the same trick again!
Oh, that was no big deal.
What the...
The lunch box!
Big Sister's precious lunch box!
Banpei...
Thank you.
Banpei?
Hey, it's the cable!
No! His memory's going to get erased!
Banpei! Banpei!

Why...
Why did this have to happen? Banpei!
Banpei! Banpei!
Skuld? What happened? Banpei! Banpei!
Banpei! Banpei!
Skuld did her best to restore Banpei's memory.
But it was too late. Banpei's memory was gone.
I'll see you later!
See you later, okay?
Even so, both Skuld and Belldandy seem to believe that...
MEMORY THANK YOU
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a Wing!
I love you so much it hurts...
And it hurts me that I can't tell you how I feel.
You and I have matching hearts...
So we must share the same scars deep down inside.
But now that I'm in your arms, I think I can catch...
Nobody else matters... All we have to do is gaze at each other.
It's all right for your heart to flutter... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
Don't run away from happiness.
I'll always be waiting for you.
So come rest your wings anytime.
It's all right to cry... anytime you need to.
I just want to see you again... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
I just want you to be happy.
The demon is enraged, and swears to get revenge on the goddesses.
And so the demon-god is resurrected, and spreads misfortune everywhere.
Next episode,'Ah! Misfortune Arrives, and the Tea-Stalk Stands Upright?'
Is that why the Earth Spirit ran, and got captured by the little girl?
