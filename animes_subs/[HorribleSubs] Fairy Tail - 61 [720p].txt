Oh, no! Nirvana's started to move!
Plus, Natsu and I are rockin' matching outfits for some reason.
I can hear you!
Natsu can't handle transportation, so he can't even stand on it.
I can hear you!
I gotta do something to stop this thing!
I can hear you!
Huh? Look at that, Natsu!
See? The Magic Circle is back to normal.
I thought your last attack erased it...
Which means that unless we beat up Mr. Smarty Pants, it's no use.
I can hear you! I won't let you.
Damn it, this guy's in our way.
We aren't going to lose when it comes to teamwork!
Cobra, get rid of them.
I hear ya. He'll make a nice meal for Cubellios.
We aren't food!
Bring it on!
Super Aerial Battle! Natsu vs. Cobra!
Cubellios!
Natsu!
Dazzling Blaze of the Fire Dragon!
It missed?
No, I'm not through yet!
S-Seriously?
Natsu, you didn't hit him even once...
But I threw so many... At least one should have hit him, normally...
I wonder...
I told you already! Your attacks can't hit me.
I can hear your movements!
Oh, you can, eh? Then take a listen to this!
Natsu, hang in there!
Fall!
Happy!
Aye, sir!
That was close... Nice one, Happy!
Where'd he go?
Run, run! It makes the hunt much more exciting!
Damn it... Really rubs our noses in his superiority, doesn't he?!
I bet women totally hate the guy.
Wait, hold it Happy.
Shh!
We'll hide here.
Then do a surprise attack!
Aye!
Don't say anything, Happy.
Aye.
He's here!
There you are!
Huh?
Not here.
But why?!
I can hear you!
Damn it!
But why?
And what do you mean, women hate guys like me?
You heard that, too?
So, where are we?
It definitely looks like a city of some sort.
What kind of magic is this, anyway?
Some ruins with crazy huge legs?
It seems like a really old city.
Exactly! Yes...
This is the fantastic city of Nirvana.
Seeing you here as well gives me confidence!
The dude from Lyon's guild!
And a member of Oracion Seis?!
But why?
Worry not. He has become our ally.
Huh?
Love, throughout the world! Yes...
No way!
Didn't this case keep spouting money, money?
Can the old dude use magic to make people see the light?
Well, this and that happened...
Oh yeah... Sherry went and flipped out, too.
Hate Jewel
Love Love
Good and evil swapped places, yeah.
What happened to Sherry?
Well, we already returned her to normal.
This is the ancient capital in which once lived the ancient Nirvit people.
Yes...
The Nirvit?
Correct. It was around 4000 years ago.
Many wars were happening around the world, see.
The Nirvit maintained their neutrality, and lamented the state of the world.
So they created a magic that would restore balance to the world. Yes...
You don't mean that magic is...
Yes. An ultra-magic that swaps light and darkness.
That magic was given the name of the Kingdom of Peace, Nirvana.
Yes...
So this walking city...
Ironic... Sheesh.
It has the name that signifies peace, and yet is being used for evil.
It would've been a good magic,
if they hadn't originally used turning light into darkness as one of its elements.
Nothing can be done now. The ancients likely never considered so far ahead.
Strong magic has strong secondary effects.
In any case, we are in trouble now that it is moving.
We must stop it without any further delay.
Yes...
Well, duh!
Yup!
What?
A light!
That's Brain, yes...
He is probably moving this city from atop the King's Summit.
While he is doing that, Brain cannot use other magic.
It is our chance to strike!
Yes...
If he's moving it... Then is he heading somewhere?
Perhaps...
However, I do not know where to.
Yes.
Only I understand what Father is thinking.
Midnight.
Oracion Seis!
It's the one that was always asleep!
Hot Eye... You betrayed my father?
No, I did not.
I merely realized that Brain is wrong.
What?
You say my father is wrong?
When did he...
Wait, what do you mean, father?
It's a father-son Dark Guild?
People's hearts are not meant to be twisted around by magic.
Even those with weak hearts, we can raise to become strong!
What just happened?
Hot Eye-dono caused the ground to collapse!
He saved us!
You all should go to the King's Summit.
The Six General's strength is well matched. Leave Midnight to me.
You and I, fight?
Liquid Ground!
Oracion Seis are gonna crush each other?
This is really quite the development.
Hot Eye-dono...
Now, hurry and go!
And also...
My real name is... Richard! Yes...
Richard-dono...
Telling your real name to the enemy...
You really have fallen, Hot Eye.
I have been awakened by love! I have no need for codenames!
Prepare yourself!
He dodged again!
You never learn, do you?
Damn it! Nothing I've thrown at him connects!
I wonder if he has some magic that lets him read our movements?
No, it lets me hear them!
I can hear your mind's thoughts, and tell your movements.
My thoughts?
In that case...
Can you hear this?
I'm well aware that you like fish.
He can really hear them!
I cleared my mind of everything except for fish!
Ooh! Me next!
He's totally spot on!
They think my magic's some sideshow?
Damn it... That was a pretty funny one, I'll admit it.
All right, I killed!
But yeah, he can totally hear them.
What were you thinking?
I'm really curious.
I'll tell you later.
But this is gonna be tricky...
I have a good idea, but I think he can hear it.
Think right but attack from the left.
Not going to work.
I can hear you planning it out.
You punks have no way to win.
Oh, I see.
I hear you. You thought about quite a lot.
You have three or four decent plans.
I heard them all!
That is so cheating!
I guess we got no choice but to head straight in!
Aye, sir!
Plan C!
Charge!
Right hook.
Left kick.
Followed by a right roundhouse kick, and a comeback straight right!
What? Impossible...
I can hear it... He's... not thinking anything!
I don't know whether he's stupid or a genius!
But I never faced someone like him before.
I see. Little tricks ain't working for you, eh?
M-My hand...
Natsu, what's the matter?
Poison Dragon Cobra... It's time I got serious.
N-No way...
Is this guy a...
Are you okay?
Damn it... What's with these attacks?
Each time they hit, I get more numb!
I can hear your pain!
The attacks of a poison dragon can infect and destroy anything!
Is that so? I'll just burn that poison right up!
Let's go!
Aye, sir!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
Fall and rot!
Fang Thrust of the Poison Dragon!
Oops! I dropped'im!
You're nauseous already? That was quick, Natsu.
Come on, snap out of it.
I'm sorry I dropped you.
I-I'm fine...
He don't know when to quit, do he, Cubellios?
Say that again!
Yeah!
Time to kick ass!
I can hear everything...
Not just your thoughts, but the movement of your muscles, even your breathing!
Crap!
Our attacks aren't hitting again!
Weren't you not thinking?
Ever since I realized he was a dragon slayer, it hasn't gone so well...
Are you saying he's gotten to you?
Come on, clear your mind!
Thinking isn't like you, Natsu! Don't do it!
What's that supposed to mean, damn you?
You makin' fun of me?
No!
I said that you work better when you don't think!
Don't. Think.
You don't have to say it twice!
And you're makin' fun of me, damn it!
No, I'm not!
What do you mean I think...?
You totally made fun of me!
Anyway, just concentrate on Cobra!
Here we go!
Aye, sir!
Talons of the Fire Dragon!
Spiral Jaw of the Poison Dragon!
This is no time to get queasy!
Natsu!
An explosion?
Somebody is fighting!
That's pretty impressive...
Which means it's...
Yup!
Did he turn to ash?
No, something's strange... What is this sound?
He's eating the flames?
Well, don't see that every day, Cubellios.
Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up!
Sure, you might have eaten flames to recover, but that doesn't mean I can't hear you!
Keep on blabbing!
Here!
Follow me if you dare, slanty-eyes!
Hey, you look just like me!
Scales of the Poison Dragon!
Max Speed!
Stupid... Don't you realize a feint isn't going to work by now?
Is this all you got after eating those flames?
I had to get close!
Roar of the...
Natsu!
You're overdoing it!
Well, I didn't know'til I tried...
You're overdoing it!
I said you don't have to say things twice!
Now it's my turn to eat!
Poison gas...
He's eating the poison.
That doesn't look so healthy.
Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up... yeah?
Don't copy me!
Rot and die!
Roar of the...
His breath attack?
This is bad!
W-What? That didn't cause much damage at all...
What's wrong, Happy?
Hang in there, Happy!
Hey!
For some reason... my body... isn't moving right...
Don't worry about it! Same for me.
That's exactly what I'm worried about!
The breath of the Poison Dragon infects your entire body with a virus!
It slowly steals your mobility and then your life!
The moment you got hit with that breath, your defeat was guaranteed!
Oh, shut the hell up!
Don't worry'bout no poison, Happy!
Aye, sir!
Does he ever listen to people when they're talking?
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
I can hear your movements!
Damn it!
Natsu, don't think!
Whatever! You concentrate on flying!
I am! All I'm thinking about is flying!
You big liar!
These guys are so annoying, don't you think, Cubellios?
But for someone to be able to still move after being hit with my poison...
You Old Generation Dragon Slayers ain't half bad.
Old Generation?
I'm a New Generation Dragon Slayer.
I received the power to slay dragons by having dragon lacrima infused into my body.
It's what Gramps said.
He's the same as Laxus!
He's not a real Dragon Slayer!
Real?
Dragon slaying magic was originally only able to be learned by dragons!
It was not a technique for humans.
If you ask me, you're the one that's the freak!
Because there ain't any dragons in this world!
What did you say?!
Try sayin' that again!
There's Igneel, damn it!
No, there isn't!
Dragons are extinct!
Don't go killing them off so easy!
Fangs of the Poison Dragon!
Natsu, hang in there!
M-My body... I can't move...
Damn it...
I can hear the poison spreading through your entire body.
Rot and die right here before me, Old Generation.
Natsu... I'm at my limit, too...
Happy, drop me right on top of him.
What are you saying, Natsu? Didn't you just say you couldn't move?
That's why I have to finish it with this move.
What are you going to do?
A full power Roar of the Fire Dragon?
Idiot... I can hear what you're thinking.
Happy, now!
Aye!
It was more of a nuisance when he was attacking without thinking.
This is over!
Roar of the...
It's no use. I can hear you!
You plan on aiming all around!
Think you can hit me no matter where I dodge?
But! It won't reach straight behind your head!
I'll smash in that head of yours!
Natsu!
Go meet your dragons in the afterlife!
Damn you!
What is that noise? A roar?
Some kind of giant monster?
No... That's...
My ears!
That was some roar, all right...
Well, I figured he had such good hearing that...
Just like I planned, yup!
It was a total coincidence, though.
Impossible... Defeating Cobra with nothing but a scream?
What in the world is that man?
That big dude from Lamia Scale said he was one of the 10 Wizard Saints, right?
Yeah. I bet he's super strong!
Don't look like it to me.
In his face, anyway.
What does the face have to do with it?
Well, maybe I'll fight him later!
I bet that you'll lose, Natsu!
Next time: Jura, the Tenth Saint!
Why won't you bet that I win?
You're cold, Happy!
I make it a rule not to fight a losing battle.
