S-Save me!
What's going on?
The dungeon hates us.
Since we keep it locked up in a place like this.
Uranus, what happened to the prayers?
You didn't tell me anything about this...
A floor boss? I knew it...
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Familia Myth The Story of a Familia
We gotta save them!
Wait.
Are you really going to go save them?
With this party?
Let's save them.
You're a failure as a leader.
But...
You didn't make the wrong decision.
Chigusa-san, take care of my Goddess.
Everybody, let's go!
Yeah!
All of you...
Don't do anything stupid.
We're done for!
He's using Howl?
Damn it!
Why...
Why is this happening?
You'll get in Bell-sama's way, so I'm carrying you away!
You should be grateful to our leader
for being such a huge softie!
What the daylights is going on?
Voles!
Gather all the weapons and adventurers you can.
We must kill the floor boss.
Don't be stupid, Andromeda!
That's not just a floor boss
Our escape route...
We have no way to leave this floor.
Until we defeat it, we can't escape.
Damn it.
We're gonna go fight that monster!
Get everybody in town!
Anybody who's too scared to fight will never be allowed back in this city!
Show them your pride as an adventurer!
Withdraw! Quickly!
Will o' Wisp!
Crap!
Thanks!
I was right. He's no ordinary floor boss.
He could be a Level 5!
Lion. Reinforcements are here.
The city mages are going to start their incantations.
You keep the Goliath distracted.
Understood.
You and I will keep the enemy distracted.
All right, men!
Andromeda will be our decoy!
Don't worry about a thing, just start chanting!
Hit'em with a big one!
Voles!
I'll get you for this!
Fire!
Buy time!
As soon as the incantation ends...
Nice.
We've got all the weapons you need!
If it breaks, just grab a new one!
We've never worked together before, so don't worry about teamwork!
Just stay out of each other's way.
Fight the way you want to fight!
Bell!
What?
Okay, everybody fall back!
We're going to blast it hard!
Fire!
Finish it off!
It can't be...
You're kidding me.
Regeneration?
Cranel-san.
Ryu-san?
You handle the monsters nearby.
We'll keep the Goliath at bay.
But...
We can't let them rip through us.
If we can buy time, the mages that are still active will be
able to fire another shot.
And if that doesn't work, we'll just have to defeat it again.
Until it stays down.
Ryu-san...
Good luck.
Hestia-sama!
Miss Supporter! You're safe?
Gather all the equipment you can, please!
You heard her, right?
Head back to town and do it.
Okay!
Where's Chigusa-sama?
She ran off during that last explosion.
She's probably with Ouka-kun and the others.
That's...
Lion! You're going to get yourself killed!
I need to do my part, too.
I can't get through to its magic stone!
At this rate we'll...
But still!
If there's any chance left...
Ouka!
Chigusa!
Give me a shield!
No! You'll die!
You'll die...
Please, Chigusa.
I don't want to be a loser who can't do anything but talk.
I don't want to be somebody who can sacrifice others,
but won't risk himself...
Cranel-san!
Lion, get back!
Firebolt!
Bell, run!
Bell-kun!
Bell...
Damn it!
Damn it all!
Ouka-dono!
Ouka-dono!
Ouka!
Cranel-san, answer me!
Bell-sama!
Bell-kun...
How's he doing?
He's breathing, but...
He's badly wounded.
Lion, I'll leave this to you.
Chigusa-dono, take care of things here, please.
Please go, Miss Elf.
Buy as much time as you can.
Bell-kun will wake up, I know it.
He'll wake up and defeat that monster!
Goddess Hestia...
You saw it too, right?
Bell-kun can do it!
He can defeat that monster!
All right.
Bell-kun! Wake up, Bell-kun!
Bell-kun!
Bell-sama!
Everyone's still fighting.
They're fighting that horrible foe.
But you can do it!
You're the only one who can!
You're the only one who can save us!
Stand up, Bell-kun!
Bell-kun! Bell-kun!
Goddess, I know!
I can hear you!
But my body... just...
My body just won't move!
Move! Move! Move!
I have to fight!
For my Goddess!
For everyone!
If anyone has the right to be called a hero,
it's not the one who took up the blade.
It's not the one who raised his shield,
nor the one who healed the wounded.
Only one who truly risks his life may be called a hero.
Protect your friends, save the girl, and face danger.
It doesn't matter if you fall. No, that's just fine.
Cry your heart out over it.
Within the defeated, a victor waits to emerge.
Stay true to your wishes.
Cry out your desires.
And if you do...
That's...
So I wouldn't be ashamed to face them...
And more than anything,
to save the people I care about...
Bell-sama!
I believe in you,
Bell-kun!
Let your longings burn.
Scream out your wishes.
Limit Off?
Don't let them get any closer!
Now in the sky, above a distant forest...
O infinite stars, scattered across the cloudless night sky,
She's using an incantation in a high-speed fight like this?
grant my foolish voice the blessing of starfire,
and grant your compassion to those who abandon you.
She's up so high...
I pray to you, my god, who destroys all things.
Lead me from the highest heavens,
and grant my tiny body the almighty power of the divine.
I know I don't deserve this!
But there's somebody I want to save!
Please! Let me destroy you!
Come forth, wandering wind,
nomadic traveler crossing the sky and wilderness.
I guess I'll have to use the one I've been saving up, too.
Bear within thee the light of stardust,
and destroy my enemy!
Luminous Wind!
Descend from the heavens and rule over the earth!
War God's Strike!
Futsunomitama!
A gravity barrier...
It's not going to last!
Get out of the way!
Fire Moon!
That's...
Crozzo's magic item?
It's surpassed the original?
Don't make yourself weigh your pride against your friends.
That's right. It's nothing but pride.
I'm sorry...
In the face of overwhelming power,
you can resist with that one little attack.
That is...
The hero's strike!
Even that attack...
Screw this!
My Bell Cranel...
He can still leap faster!
Stronger!
And ever-higher!
Bell-sama! Bell-sama did it!
Ouka!
Not bad, Little Rookie.
I saw it!
I, Hermes, bore witness!
Not up to it?
Don't be a fool, Zeus!
Your grandson, the present you left us, is the real thing!
He's the last hero of your Familia!
Things are about to change!
And I shall see it with my own eyes.
The historic events that will happen here, in Orario!
The fates of the heroes! Their lives and deaths!
The story told by our beloved children!
The Familia Myth!
His resolve was crazy!
Don't drink.
And you won't believe what happened next!
You drinking?
You worked hard.
You really worked hard. Didn't you, Bell-kun?
