The fight doesn't end until I fulfill my dream
I wonder how far I've come now?
In ten years, I'll be living the dream
It's the scenario I wrote for myself, so I'll have no regrets
But life isn't that easy, and it's full of obstacles
Still, I swear to myself that I won't ever back down
I have a dream that I absolutely want to achieve
So I fuel my passion until I succeed
There will be meetings and partings along the way
But I'll simply believe in my strength that you've taught me
And rise back up again and again and again

The reason I chose to take a detour
was to fall ever deeper in love with you
I have a feeling I've always known
what your voice sounds like when it calls my name
With my fingertips I drew
many lines that make up a suspension bridge leading to you
Show me the way I'm sure our path
Be
eve
your way connects us without any turns
Show me the way It leads to the place where we promised
Show me the way I will never give up
Be
eve
your way Raise your gaze
Show me the way and see that we're certain to meet again

Ashirogi Muto
It's ending in issue 31?!
Only two chapters left?!
I'm sorry.
We wanted to quit, so we talked it over with the editorial department.
Why?!
I don't get it!
We really had to think this through...
Sorry for being so selfish!
I'm all for it.
I always thought that a gag manga didn't suit you.
Next time, write a story manga that will force Miura to go along with you!
Rather than forcing him, we just want to make something that he can't complain about.
So we'll definitely get serialized again within six months.
We can pay you until then, but only at half the normal rate.
Huh? What's that about? I don't need it!
I don't need it, either.
Actually, looking at you guys gets me fired up, too.
Until my savings run out,
I'll bury myself in a new work and get a serialization myself!
Both of these authors are so cool!
They ended their own serialization?
Yeah.
Why?!
Did something happen?
They did it to beat Niizuma.
Huh?
How would they beat him by quitting?
They've got some guts.
Their next work will be big.
I see. It's gone as you planned.
No, I never expected them to go that far.
But you're glad, aren't you?
But no matter how they come at me, I won't lose.
Gas, gas, gas, gas, ga!
Ashirogi won't lose to you this time, Niizuma!
Akira, you're the best.
Something he can't complain about, huh?
But I have no idea what to write.
Maybe we should have waited until I had a breakthrough before saying we wanted to quit.
Before you think about our next work, you've got to focus on wrapping up Tanto, right?
I know, but...
If we don't submit something that can compete with Eiji's work
to one of the three serialization committees over the next six months, we can't draw for Jack anymore.
Are you regretting it?
No, I'm on fire.
I also think this was for the best.
Let's give it our all!
Yeah!
I'll go home and think about the last chapter, then.
Good night.
You've told Kaya about this already, right?
Yeah, everything except that we can't draw for Jack anymore if we don't submit something that can compete with Eiji's work.
See ya.
A manga we can beat Eiji with...
I'll let Azuki know.
Father... you know that's a promise I cannot make.
Father... you know that's a promise I can't make!
That's probably wrong...
Mashiro!
We've come to an understanding with the editorial department,
so Hirameki Tanto -kun will end in issue 31.
I'll definitely make our next series a big hit!
I'm praying for your next manga to be a hit.
I'm going to many auditions, aiming to become a more popular actress.
All so I can play the heroine in an Ashirogi Muto anime.
Go for it!
Azuki!
We'll get serialized within six months for sure!
It's good!
I'm home.
Oh, he's back.
Perfect timing, dinner's ready.
Okay.
Thanks for the food.
Just mackerel, pickled vegetables, and miso soup?
Since we decided to quit Tanto three days ago,
haven't our meals become pretty simple?
Well, we're just being frugal, right?
Should I get out the toppings?
No, I'm fine.
If she's like this just because we're ending Tanto,
I definitely can't tell her we might not write for Jack anymore.
I can't worry her any more.
Don't get cheap.
Let's eat and buy the things we want.
I won't be able to write something good if I start feeling cheap.
Don't they say that poverty dulls the mind?
So it's okay to go all out and buy brand name stuff?
Yeah! Buy it! Go crazy!
Clothes, purses, shoes... buy whatever you want!
I was just joking...
That'll get me pumped up!
Listen, I'll never let you suffer for money.
I'll get a big hit soon, so believe in me.
Akito...
Is he trying to drive himself into a corner?
Okay then! Tomorrow, I'll go buy some brand name lipstick!
Right! By tomorrow afternoon, I'll have finished up the last storyboard for Tanto!
I want to beat Niizuma Eiji.
But I can't do it with Tanto.
So please let us end Tanto!
What should I have them write next?
Something that can get serialized...
On top of that, something that can compete with CROW and +NATURAL.
Maybe I should wait until they have something to show me.
But that would make me completely useless.
Yep, it's a good final chapter.
Thank you!
Good work.
You, too.
Well then, what kind of work will you be doing next?
How's that going?
Well, I haven't come up with anything yet.
Hattori said that something non-mainstream could win against Eiji.
So we should do something dark, like Eiji said.
I have an idea.
The only thing you beat Niizuma in the rankings with was Money and Intelligence.
How about expanding on that a bit and making it Money, Intelligence, and Appearance?
Money, Intelligence, and Appearance?
Right.
KTM for short.
KTM?
What do you think? It's dark, right?
It's good.
Real good.
Ideas keep flowing in.
In Money and Intelligence, you could buy brains,
and people were ranked nationally by how smart they were.
But this time, people can also buy bodies; physical appearance!
Will they buy appearance or intelligence?
Men and women would differ in what they value.
Many things are different depending on how attractive you are.
Um, is it okay to write something like this?
Just write what you want to.
I'll point out things that might be inappropriate.
Money, Intelligence, and Appearance.
I can't believe Miura thought of this.
Women especially want to be beautiful.
Spending lots of money on brand name lipstick, visiting beauty salons...
What if the heroine had a pure mind and body that she refuses to sell?
Nice!
That's Azuki's role.
Rank wouldn't just be based on intelligence anymore,
but appearance as well.
There would be an intelligence rank, an appearance rank, and an overall rank.
What a horrible world! I wouldn't want to live in it.
And then?
So, say a really handsome but stupid guy sells his body for more intelligence...
Well, if he's that stupid, he wouldn't do something that smart.
Well then, I guess he'd be only a little stupid...
It's all gotta be measured, huh?
Right! You're taking it in a direction I like.
Takagi, you really are good at these kinds of stories.
Miura is trying to get Takagi on a roll, and he's working with his strengths!
So would having the protagonist be ugly and moderately intelligent at the beginning be the best way to go?
Wait, the protagonist in a shounen manga can't be ugly, can he?
That's not true!
Mashiro can cover that up with his art.
That's Ashirogi Muto!
Mashiro, you can draw that, right?
Uh, yeah.
Man, this is great! It's really interesting!
He's working with my strengths, too? Not just Shujin's?
I'd better write down my ideas.
I guess it's best to do something you really want to do.
A-Anyway, let's go with this for Tanto's storyboard.
Mashiro, please start the manuscript with this.
As soon as you're done, get to work on KTM's protagonist design.
Takagi should concentrate on KTM now.
Yes!
See you.
Miura seems different somehow.
Yeah. Suggesting a story manga, a non-mainstream one at that,
and even bringing ideas for it...
And he's trying his best to bring out our strengths.
I thought he was really unreliable when we started working together,
but he's gotten pretty trustworthy now.
We have to try hard, too!
KTM is gonna be great!
It checks out.
Good job!
Good night.
Good night!
I'll definitely come back!
So you'd better get serialized!
I'm looking forward to it.
Right!
We'll see you within six months!
The final chapter's been finished without a hitch, huh?
Good job, Saiko.
You too, Shujin.
It's been quite a journey.
Yeah.
But it's a bit sad to think about it ending.
I didn't think it'd be this hard to keep a gag manga going.
I was pulling all-nighters night after night, and what I finally came up with wasn't popular.
But it's because it was hard, because I felt the pain of creating something,
I got more and more attached to Tanto, and could keep going even though it was tough.
It's sad to see it end.
We have to make something better than Tanto.
Better than CROW and Natural!
If we do, then our readers will understand.
I'll do it! I'll write something that can surpass Niizuma Eiji!
We've grown a lot since we made Money and Intelligence.
Well, that was four years ago, so it would be a problem if we hadn't.
You've gotten better at super deformed and serious art.
Even I can tell, so it must be a lot better.
Miura's not the only one who's grown!
Right. It's all thanks to Tanto!
I've got so many ideas, I don't know what to do with them all!
Whoa, this much? Amazing!
It includes the second chapter's storyboard.
Oh, so that's why there's so much here.
I'll read it now.
It's drawing me in.
But there's a bit too much...
I think we'll have to cut it short.
How far do you think it should go?
I think it'd be best to cut it at page 21.
Alright, Mashiro, make a clean copy of the first 21 pages!
Okay!
I'll make a clean copy that'll bring out the storyboard's quality even further!
Miura, I'm going to submit KTM to the next serialization committee.
Yes, I'll leave it to you.
Ashirogi really went for it with this one.
I'm confident that it's better than Tanto.
Try not to rush things too much this time.
Yes, sir!
He should be calling us pretty soon...
I can't seem to calm down.
When we get home, I'm making a feast!
All right! Looking forward to it.
Here it is!
Hello, this is Takagi.
Tanto just ended and you're already at the committee.
But it's better to start a serialization sooner than later.
What? It failed?
What?! Even though you were so confident about it?!
Why, Miura?
Sorry. I'm not the one who decides this, so I really can't say.
But this was for the best.
Huh?
You couldn't have beaten Niizuma Eiji with that.
So it's better this way.
We couldn't beat Eiji, so it's all good?
I don't get it...
Miura's really changed.
He's not so obsessed with just getting serialized.
I agree when he says that we can't beat Eiji yet.
That's just the opinion of the higher ups, right?
Besides, we had a lot of confidence in it, and so did Miura...
Let's make KTM even better and submit it to the next committee!
That's what Miura plans to do!
Okay.
All right, I'll give it my all!
I'll make KTM better, and we'll get it next time!
We're not going
with KTM?
Yeah. We'll go with another work.
Wh-What are you saying, Miura?!
We have to get a serialization at one of the next two committees!
You get that, right?
He's right!
It's easy to tell us to make another work, but do you have any more ideas?
Yeah.
Next, you're doing a mainstream fantasy.
Mainstream fantasy?
That's right.
A fantasy adventure full of laughter and tears.
He's gone insane from the shock of KTM failing.
Is he still talking about humor?
I'm dead serious.
Let's see... something like One Piece.
If we could make something like that, we'd have done it ages ago!
We're not suited for mainstream.
So we gave up
Don't give up!
Do it!
Do it as if your life depended on it!
This doesn't make any sense.
Saiko, say something!
Please tell us why you want a mainstream fantasy.
Because you've never actually tried it.
Well, it's true that we've never done a mainstream fantasy... more like, we shouldn't even try to do one...
In that case, there are tons of genres we haven't tried yet... sports manga, romantic comedy, delinquent manga...
No, it has to be a mainstream fantasy.
You have two months to put all you've got into one!
Let's try it.
Huh?
I-I'm the one who has to think of the story...
Me and Miura will think about it, too.
Right.
I don't think Miura would say this on a whim.
We've come this far, so we have to trust him!
Yes, trust me!
Okay, I'll give it a go.
Let's concentrate on making the setting as simple as possible,
and rely on Mashiro's art to make it look really cool.
Okay!
By the way, I heard from Yuujirou.
If Ashirogi doesn't make something as good as CROW and Natural, they can't draw for Jack anymore.
Uh, yeah.
Akira, are you lowering the bar for Ashirogi?
On the contrary, I think I'm the one raising the bar for them.
Then have Akina Aiko rewrite the last few chapters of the manuscript.
They're not good?
You can't tell? It's powered down lately. I can see the author's hesitation.
Before, you could tell what was going on with just the narration, but it's lost its sharpness.
Okay. I'll get her to fix it.
It's because our meetings have been awkward lately.
Niizuma, can you tell all that from this script?
The narration?
I want you to refine it a bit and rewrite it.
I understand.
Okay then, I'll leave it to you.
You haven't praised my work lately.
You don't want to make me unduly happy by complimenting me.
That's how I see it.
You're reading too much into it.
Am I no good?
When did I say that?
You have talent!
I'm not talking about my work... I mean as a woman.
Please answer me!
Am I no good as a woman?
You liked Takagi, didn't you?
Takagi got married, and you decided you couldn't like him anymore.
That's fine.
But to replace him with me...
You're wrong!
That's the only thing that makes sense!
You're still young.
Take a look around.
There must be some wonderful young men at your uni
There aren't!
Fine.
We're meeting every week.
Use that time to try and change my mind.
Yes!
Here's the third chapter.
But still, why a mainstream fantasy?
I don't get it.
Even if he says it's because we haven't done one before.
But Shujin, once you decided on a story, you haven't had trouble writing it.
That's because he said, Don't make the setting too elaborate. Rely on Saiko's art to make it look cool.
But to me, it feels like something's missing.
Comment.
Comment?
This is good!
I may just be stupid, but I like easy to understand stuff.
Well, it's just a story about a hero who goes to defeat monsters
that spawn from a volcano crater with a sword that can seal it up.
It may be a simple story, but I like it better that way.
The protagonist's father is a military captain that hasn't come home for five years, right?
So they're looking for new heroes, and the nine-year-old protagonist puts his name forth.
The way he tries to show off his amateur sword skills to the commander is funny,
and when he remembers his father, it's touching.
Hmm, really?
Maybe we overlooked this approach.
I also think this is like a Jack manga.
Hmm, I dunno...
I don't think it's a good idea to leave the setting so undeveloped.
It'll definitely be good if you have him beat the monster in a cool way!
Maybe this'll work.
Maybe we were too fixated on the idea that we can't do mainstream.
If this really does pass, then what have I spent all my time doing?
Why can't you think of it as making progress?
All right, I have no issues with it.
I'll submit STOPPER OF MAGMA to the committee.
We'll leave it to you.
How'd you like working on it?
It was harder than KTM but easier than Tanto.
I see.
The committee is in one week.
I'll let you know.
Okay!
It's been a while since we all went to class together.
For the next week until the committee, we should do our best to make up for missing so many classes.
It's been too long; I just can't relax.
Just how much do you skip?
A call?
It's Miura.
Hello?
What is it?
They won't even submit it to the committee?!
N-No way...
Wh-Why?
We did it just as you said...
and you had no problems with it!
It was well done,
but they said it wasn't your usual quality.
Then we should have fixed up KTM and submitted that, after all!
Yeah, probably...
What's with that?!
You should have told us to do that from the start!
Sorry.
Sorry?!
We've got no more breathing room!
If we fail at the next committee...
That was something you decided, not me.
Well, don't get so angry. I'm heading over there now.
It sounds like you're outside... is an hour from now okay?
He says he's coming to the studio.
Huh? What about class?
Sorry, go by yourself.
A non-mainstream story manga didn't pass, and neither did a mainstream manga.
Was it really all right to believe in Miura?
I thought he had changed.
Yeah...
He's here.
Hattori?
It's been a while.
Why are you here?
Oh, I see.
Miura had changed way too much.
Sorry, actually...
Hattori, you believe that Ashirogi can really compete with Niizuma, right?
Then please tell me why you believe it...
Tell me how can they compete with him!
I don't care about appearances anymore.
I'll do whatever it takes to make them succeed.
I know it's unreasonable, but even if it's just a hint...!
I'm actually grateful.
If it's okay with you, let me help!
So it was Hattori who came up with the KTM idea?
That was Miura.
But I came up with the mainstream fantasy idea after that.
I also share responsibility for this.
That's why I came here.
Listen, the next serialization committee is the real thing.
Put everything you've learned up until now into your next work!
If our next work doesn't pass at the serialization committee, that's it for us!
Will we have to quit drawing for Jack?
Hint and Best.
Let's try everything in order to reach our dream!
