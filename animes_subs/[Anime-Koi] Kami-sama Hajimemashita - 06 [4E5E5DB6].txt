The Deity hhhhCatches hhhhh a Cold
The Deity hhhhCatches hhhhh a Cold
We'll be back soon!
We're back!
Two days have passed since I returned to the shrine.
I haven't felt normal since yesterday.
Good morning, Nanami.
What's wrong?
Your face is re
No, I'm not blushing.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
My heart has been thumping nonstop since that happened.
What?
Do you need soy sauce?
No.
It's upsetting me.
He's just a fox.
Act normal.
Act normal.
Act normal.
I knew it. You really do have a fever.
Huh?
No way, it says 39.8!
What a high fever!
You'd better not go to school today.
I can bear with this much.
Besides, I've missed too many days already.
I might have to repeat a year if I keep it up.
T-Tomoe-dono.
Stop Nanami-sama!
L-Let me go!
I can't allow you to go in your current condition.
This is a good opportunity.
Take the day off from school.
I-It's not as simple as you think!
And more importantly, what the heck are you doing?!
I'm saying it because I want to help you.
In that case, why doesn't Tomoe-dono disguise himself as Nanami-sama
and go to school in place of her?
Huh?
That's a great idea!
Thus, Momozono Nanami will be taking the day off.
I'm sorry.
Is Momozono not coming to school again?
She's going to repeat a year. I'm calling it now.
So, who wants to bet that she won't come today?
Betting starts at 300 yen!
You seem to talk about her a lot.
Don't tell me you actually like her.
What?!
You gotta be kiddin' me.
We're talking about Momozono here, the girl who had nothing but rice in her lunch box!
How can I not make fun of her?
Hey.
Huh?
Sorry, but could you please get away from my seat?
That is my seat, right?
M-Momozono Nanami?!
What's with that aura?
Is she always like this?
I can see flowers floating around her.
Did her chest get bigger too?
Damn you, Nanami. I'm going to make sure you pay me back for this in full.
Good morning.
It's been long week.
but Kurama, the super-busy idol, will be coming to school today.
Crow Goblin?!
This is a souvenir.
Oh.
Nanami, you've...
You've turned into quite the lady while I was gone.
Especially your chest.
You're a fool, Crow Goblin.
My disguise is perfect.
Going to school in disguise is going to be a walk in the park.
What?!
The fox transferred here?
Yeah.
The girls were all squealing about it.
Though, I think he's out sick today.
But I still think you're way cooler, Kurama-kun!
This is a copy of a script I wrote.
If you have the time, could you...
Is this for real?
Damn it, I turn my back for a second and this happens.
I'd intended to get close to her with the fox out of the picture...
I guess I just have to work faster.
Okay, next page.
Please read it from the top.
Miss Momozono.
What language is this?
What's wrong?
Please start reading.
Hmph, Teacher.
Nanami was sick not too long ago, so she still can't speak clearly.
I'll read it instead.
Do you know how can I get to Paris?
I love and eager to visit Paris.
Mademoiselle, the last is a hot spot in the tourist guide...
Kurama-sama's so smart!
His pronunciation is too heavenly to be real.
How's that, Nanami?
Huh?
Second Period!
Taiyou ni kagayaku junpaku no wing
Pure white wings that glow in the sun
Okay, stop!
Momozono-san.
You're the only one who's off-key.
From the top, please.
That's not going to work.
Why don't we let a pro give us some tips?
Okay.
Taiyou ni kagayaku junpaku no wing
Pure white wings that glow in the sun
Yorokobi ni idakareta maiagaru
Rising up, enveloped in happiness
Hallelujah
Subete wa kono uta no naka ni
I'll put everything into this one song
Kiss me Kiss me Paradise
A live performance by Kurama-sama!
I can die happy now.
He's too amazing.
He can even do choir songs!
Hmph, have you fallen in love with the sound of my voice, Nanami?
Eh?
Huh?
Nanami.
What's wrong?
You seem to be in a bad mood today.
If you're having problems,
I can help you
Let me make something clear.
I think you're an eyesore.
Please stay away from me.
Huh?
You're only after my heart, correct?
I know you want my deity mark.
You should give up.
Oh, is that what's been troubling you?
I'm sorry I didn't realize it sooner.
But you're misunderstanding something.
What did you say, Kurama-sama?!
Playing hard-to-get?
I only wanted to conquer your heart.
I'll kill you if you touch me again.
You didn't have to punch me.
Nanami, I'm being serious now.
It seems that the miasma in this school has gotten thicker.
You should avoid walking alone in dark places.
Miasma?
I see.
The shadows have gotten darker.
Darkness is the entrance to the other world.
This must mean that
an entrance has opened up somewhere in this school.
That Crow Goblin is sharper than he looks.
Ami, you need to hurry up or we'll be late.
Just wait! I can't find my headband.
I'm pretty sure I put it in here.
You're taking too long.
I'm leaving.
Kei-chan, turn the lights back on!
It's too dark. I can't see a thing.
Kei-chan?
This is bad. I'm all alone now.
This room is underground.
Light can't come in if you close the door.
Kei-chan, you stupid.
A cute, cute girl.
As sweet, sweet as candy.
What flavor might you be?
Huh?
Lick.
Strawberry.
Someone!
I've been looking for you, girl from Class 2.
M-Momozono-san!
A ghost! There's a ghost!
It's like a opossum with a long tongue!
I know that.
It's a visitor from the other world.
You should head to class.
What about you, Momozono-san?
I'll come too, once I'm done here.
But...
Leave. You're getting in the way.
Ami, the teacher is here now.
Kei-chan.
You're such a slowpoke.
You and Momozono-san are the only two left.
Did you see her in the changing room?
Kei-chan...
You go first!
Huh? Ami...
I love this place.
So many girls undress in here.
Just watching the scenery would be enough for me.
S-So please don't burn me!
You deviant, low-class demon.
It's not exactly my role to exterminate demons like you.
However, this is for the good of Nanami.
I have to wipe out every possible threat that might cause her trouble in the future.
What a hassle.
Momozono-san.
Huh?
You don't have a flavor!
You're not tasty!
Wait!
I hate you!
Strawberry!
Lick.
That's as far as you go.
Oh? Kurama-kun?
I told you to avoid dark places, didn't I?
Right, Namami?
It's bitter, bitter.
Kurama, take the girl with you and go outside.
Um... Kurama-kun, what are those noises?
It's nothing.
We should get back to class.
But, Momozono-san's still...
Let's make what happened today our little secret.
Promise?
O-Okay.
I'm coming in.
Where's the demon?
Did you let it go?
Whatever.
But you should be more careful.
I can't protect you all the time because I can't watch over you like that fox.
Don't do anything stupid when he's not around.
Then, Tomoe will be coming with me to school starting tomorrow.
Huh?
For you.
Here's a freshly-caught, soft-shelled turtle.
She will surely feel better once she eats this.
Nanami-chan, do you eat turtle?
You have bad taste.
I'm not sure how to cut this.
That aside, why are you in my kitchen?
Huh? I heard that Tomoe-kun wasn't here today,
so I dropped by to see you.
Next thing you know, these two are begging me to make you dinner.
Ouch!
The turtle bit Mizuki-dono's finger!
Bring some water!
While Tomoe is out disguised as Nanami and going to school for her,
Yunomori-sama's familiar, Mizuki, comes to see Nanami.
Huh?
Tomoe-kun disguised himself as you and went to school?
If you try to boil the turtle alive one more time, I'll punch you in the face!
The spell your words cast on him must be powerful.
I didn't do anything like that.
I simply asked him for help.
You asked him, huh?
Looks like he's good at putting up a front.
What do you mean?
He used to be a wild fox, you know.
He must think that he can win you over like that.
Mizuki, don't speak ill about Tomoe.
I don't want people to judge him based on his looks or who he used to be.
I've realized that because we've spent so much time together.
People misunderstand him easily,
but he really does have a gentle side.
As I thought, you've fallen into his trap, Nanami-chan.
Huh?
I'd expect no less of Tomoe-kun.
A familiar is his deity's servant,
but it's plain as day that you're doing the serving.
Let your guard down in front of that beast, and one day you won't have a head on your shoulders.
Like I said, he's not like that at all.
Man, you're stubborn.
Who's stubborn?
Then, I'll let you see with your own eyes.
The real Tomoe-kun.
Mizuki-dono, what is this incense burner for?
This is the Censer of Recollection.
It's a holy censer that transports your soul to the past.
To a time long, long ago, before you were born.
You'll meet a Tomoe-kun you won't even recognize.
A Tomoe that I wouldn't recognize?
Nanami-sama?
It's okay.
I only nudged her soul a little so it would waltz about in the flow of time.
Get a good look at the past, the time before you were born.
See the Tomoe-kun that ran about before you two met.
It hurts!
What exactly does he mean by seeing the true nature of Tomoe?
Huh?
Were my hands always this small?
My clothes and hair are different too.
Don't tell me I've turned into someone else!
I get it, this is a dream!
It hurts!
It hurts!
A child!
What's wrong, boy?
Onee-chan, don't go back into the village.
There are demons attacking it.
Demons?
The Bloodthirsty King is looking for you.
It took all I had to run away.
But the others...
The Bloodthirsty King?
A demon's looking for me?
Is this a dream?
It's a good thing I found this empty building.
It's kinda rundown,
but it's good enough to keep out the rain.
We're drenched.
I'd better treat his wounds.
What an awful thing to do to a child...
It was rather lucky for me
that you were out farming.
The King would never let a pretty little lady like you escape.
Everyone wants to hog the spoils for themselves.
Oh crap, he's a demon too!
I'll gobble you up before the Bloodthirsty King even finds you.
Someone...
T-Tomoe-sama...
A fox flame?
That garbage burned rather well.
Are you a girl from the village?
Tomoe.
You're quite the pearl for someone from a small village.
Tomoe?
Your voice is splendid too.
Now cry for me, human
This isn't... This isn't Tomoe!
Who... are you?
Tomoe!
We couldn't find you anywhere.
So this is where you wandered off to.
There's someone else now.
This is my chance to escape.
I'm staying out of the rain.
I don't like to get wet.
Man, you're cold.
I heard there were beauties in this village, but all I could find were old ladies and kids.
A bunch of them managed to get away too.
The pretty ones must have escaped with them.
Girls managed to escape from you?
You must be getting old, Bloodthirsty King.
Have you seen a young lady around here?
It's a girl named Yukiji.
Nope.
He used to be a wild fox.
Let your guard down in front of that beast,
and one day you won't have a head on your shoulders.
He's not like that.
He's not like that.
I see, this must be a dream.
Nanami-chan.
You were out for quite a while.
Where am I?
We're still in your shrine.
Nanami-sama, we were so worried about you because you wouldn't wake up!
I feel heavy.
Did I fall asleep?
Nope.
I cast your soul into the past.
What you saw were the true events of the past.
Did you meet Tomoe-kun?
I didn't.
Who didn't you meet?
Why is the snake boy here?
Did you have fun at school?
What are you doing here?
What have you done to Nanami?
Not. Telling.
Go home!
That snake bastard.
Why did you let him in?
We thought he could cook soft-shelled turtle for Nanami
What the hell does that have to do with him?!
Nanami.
You're still a bit feverish.
I'll make you something.
Get some more rest while I prepare it.
This hand...
This is the gentle hand that belongs to Tomoe.
What's wrong?
Did Mizuki do something to you?
I just saw a nightmare.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
I'm glad this is the Tomoe I know.
By the way, how was school?
Tomoe has finally gotten accustomed to school life.
He's popular with the girls.
Nanami's heart also races when she sees him.
Let your courage out and take the next step toward a new relationship.
Next time, Asking the Deity Out on a Date.
Hey, let's go to the aquarium.

Because she's...
has disappeared
Into the distant sky
