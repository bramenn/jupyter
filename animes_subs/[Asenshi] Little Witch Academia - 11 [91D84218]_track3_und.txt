Sosomme Tiextrira!
It's upside-down!
So close! Restoration magic attempt one-hundred, just fell short.
It's the hundred and first...
Don't concern yourself with that! Tomorrow, you're sure to succeed...
She's such a nice person to meet with you every single day.
And here I am, not improving one bit.
Wow, Akko's in low spirits? Are we going to see an apparition next?
Wow, Akko's discouraged? It feels like an apparition might appear.
Chariot must have partaken in forbidden love.
Chariot isn't dumb enough to let that happen!
How embarrassing, it's been so long since I had a visitor.
Professor, you're an alumna here, right?
What?
Or were you even classmates, maybe?
Well...
I can't believe it was true.
Wow! What kind of person was Chariot? Did she stand out in class?
She must've been so pretty.
Why did Chariot disappear? Where is she, and what is she doing?
Ever since I saw her show, it's been my dream to be like Shiny Chariot.
And once, she said to me, Fedoarae Afergou.
Fedoarae Afergou?
Reach for what you dream of and you reach in vain. Work for what you dream of, day after day, and it is yours to grasp.
That which is dreamed cannot be grasped. Only what is worked for one step at a time may be obtained.
But open your hands and there you will find the fruits of your daily efforts.
In any case, you should keep the Shiny Rod close to your heart.
In the meanwhile, take good care of the Shiny Rod.
The moon's shining so bright!
The moon is so big.
They founded this school in an era when magic was still in abundance.
That was sixteen-hundred years ago, back when Luna Nova existed in its full glory.
I was unable to find it in the library, and hoped that you might know of its whereabouts.
Ah, yesDiana?
Fedoarae Afergou.
Reach for what you dream of and you reach in vain. Work for what you dream of, day after day, and it is yours to grasp.
That which is dreamed cannot be grasped. Only what is worked for one step at a time may be obtained.
The apparition of yore, appearing only during a blue moon
It will answer the questions of those who can appease it with its boundless knowledge.
Tonight is my only chance for several years.
The apparition will appear in the Blue Moon Abyss.
At the base of Luna Nova's New Moon Tower,
underneath the chapel, lies a cave known as the Blue Moon Abyss.
That is where the apparition will appear.
According to legend, the entrance to the cave only opens on the night of a blue moon.
There exists a hidden art that witches have passed down from the age of megaliths.
The hidden art known as the Grand Triskelion has the power to change the world.
In the seventh century, the Nine Olde Witches sealed the Grand Triskelion within Arcturus.
Only the staff bearing the seven stars, Claiomh Solais, may break the seal.
Only the staff bearing seven stars, Claiomh Solais, may break the seal.
To use it, one must speak the seven Words of Arcturus.
Noctu Orfei Aude Fraetor.
Strive for utopia.
You're a lie.
The future can only be obtained at a cost.
I've failed so much and made so many mistakes, but I don't want any of that past to be erased!
The tears and frustration and laughter are all a part of me.
Reach for what you dream of and you reach in vain. Work for what you dream of, day after day, and it is yours to grasp!
That which is dreamed cannot be grasped. Only what is worked for one step at a time may be obtained!
Fedoarae...
Afergou!
Quite a few years have passed since last we met, Professor Woodward.
Just as you tested me.
Just as you did for me.
Fedoarae Afergou.
Sosomme Tiextrilla!
You can do it!
One last piece!
It's upside down!
I did it!
Oh, goodness.
So close!
Restoration magic attempt one hundred, fell just short.
That was the one hundred and first...
Don't let that get you down! You'll get it right tomorrow...
I hope.
Yeah, me too.

I've been getting afterschool lessons from Professor Ursula for a whole month already.
She must be a really kind person for helping you every single day.
And here I am, not improving one bit...
What if I have no potential to get better?
Wow, Akko's in low spirits? Is an apparition going to come to life next?
I want to see Chariot.
I want to ask her how I can be more like her.
It's been ten years since her last magic show.
Where did Chariot go? Why did she suddenly disappear?
Where are you now?
Chariot must have fallen prey to forbidden love!
She set off after her lover to the ends of the earth.
Or maybe someone petrified her with poison.
Chariot isn't some dimwit who'd let that happen!
You think Professor Ursula might know something?
Both of them used to be students here.
They're about the same age, so maybe they were classmates
Classmates?!
Or something like that.
I'll go ask!
Huh?
Professor Ursula!
This late at night?
She's probably in her room!
Professor! I want to talk!
H-How can I help you?
Huh?
Professor, your glasses.
How embarrassing, it's been so long since I last had a visitor.
Wow, so you have a crow as your familiar.
Good evening. I'm Akko!
W-Would you like some tea?
Now then, what did you want to discuss?
Professor, you used to be a student here, right?
Huh?
Have you ever met Shiny Chariot?
Or maybe you were even classmates.
Yes...
Really?! Classmates?!
P-Perhaps we were...
I can't believe it was true!
Wow! What kind of person was Chariot?
Did she stand out in class?
I-I suppose...
She must've been so pretty!
Some might've agreed...
Why did Chariot disappear? Where is she now, and what is she doing?
I can't say...
I see.
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
You know...
Yes?
Ever since I saw her show, it's been my dream to be like Chariot.
I still believe in it now.
But, sometimes...
I get scared.
If I ever get to meet Chariot, I want to ask her whether I can really become someone like her.
Professor?
In the past, I also had a professor I looked up to.
Once, she told me something. Phaidoari Afairrynghor.
Phaidoari... Afairrynghor?
That which is dreamed cannot be grasped.
But work towards it, day after day, and you will find it in your hands.
In any case, take good care of the Shiny Rod.
The moon looks so blue tonight!
Come to think of it, tonight is the blue moon.
I see. Our latest intelligence confirms that the number of witches continues to decrease?
Yes, and previous reports about magic weakening across the world remain true.
The great Nine Olde Witches.
They founded this school in an era when magic was still abundant.
That was sixteen hundred years ago, back when Luna Nova existed in its full glory.
I wonder when it was that we witches became unable to use magic without a sorcerer's stone.
Excuse me, this is Diana.
Oh, Diana. Do come in.
I am searching for a certain bookan ancient tome regarding the Nine Olde Witches.
I did not find it in the library, so I wondered if you might know of its whereabouts.
If you're looking for a book about ancient magic, the place to search is Luna Nova's reference archives.
You need special permission to gain access.
I trust that you will use this responsibly.
I am most grateful.
Oh yes, Diana.
Go when the moon is high in the sky.
Tonight is a blue moon.
The magic of the blue moon may reveal a secret to you.
Phaidoari Afairrynghor.
That which is dreamed cannot be grasped.
But work towards it, day after day, and you will find it in your hands.
Come to think of it, tonight is the blue moon.
A dream?
That's right!
Found it!
Hey, do you know what a blue moon is?
Shiny
Shiny
Chariot
Chariot
When there are two full moons in a month, the second one is called a blue moon.
It only happens once every few years.
Blue Moon
An apparition of yore, emerging but during a blue moon
Though hard to please, knows of the past, present, and future.
Drawing on its boundless knowledge, it will answer the questions of those who can appease it.
Answer... the questions.
Tonight is my last chance for the next several years.
The apparition will show up in the Blue Moon Abyss.
Little Witch Academia
Little Witch Academia
At the base of Luna Nova's New Moon Tower,
underneath the chapel, lies a cave known as the Blue Moon Abyss.
That is where the apparition will come forth.
Legends say the entrance to the cave only opens on the night of a blue moon.
The cave's entrance...
This leads to the Blue Moon Abyss...
There exists a hidden art that witches have passed down from the megalithic ages.
The hidden art known as the Grand Triskelion has the power to change the world.
In the seventh century, the Nine Olde Witches sealed the Grand Triskelion within Arcturus.
Only the staff bearing the seven stars, Claiomh Solais, may break the seal.
To use it, one must speak the seven Words of Arcturus.
The seven Words?
Noctu Orfei, Aude Fraetor.
Strive for a place of idylls.
The day she arrived at Luna Nova, Akko revived the first Word.
The staff!
Noctu Orfei!
Noctu... Orfei!
Aude!
Aude!
Fraetor!
Shiny Arc!
Oblivious of the truth...
Akko!
Chariot might've been here too.
Why have you come?
Why have you come?
Begone...
Why have you come?
Begone!
Chariot!
We meet... at last.
I saw your magic show!
I came to Luna Nova to become a witch like you.
How can I become more like you?
You are who I dream of being!
Haven't you realized it by now?
No matter how much you reach out, your dream will never come true.
You're lying.
Chariot would never say something like that!
Chariot taught me that a believing heart is my magic!
Who are you?
The blue moon apparition?
Did you create that fake Chariot?
Were you mocking me?
What have you come for?
There's something I need to ask you.
Can't you answer any question about the past, present, and future?
I know not everything.
However, that which I have no answer for
cannot be answered by anyone else.
Please reveal my future to me!
Can I really become a witch like Chariot?
How pointless.
It's more important to me than my life!
Is this the future you wish for?
My dream...
Enter the gate.
This future can be yours.
However, in exchange for this radiant future, you will lose your past.
What do you mean?
Grasping this future comes at a cost.
Surrender your past.
Erase your unneeded past.
Wait!
Don't erase it!
It's full of failures and mistakes I've made, but I don't want it to be erased!
Why? There is no value in retaining it.
The tears and frustration and laughter, they're all part of me!
It's my life, and it doesn't belong to anybody else!
I've lived it as hard as I could!
I won't erase it!
Are you certain?
Will you give up on becoming Chariot?
I won't!
I'll work hard and become an amazing witch!
It's just like Professor told me.
That which is dreamed cannot be grasped.
But work towards it, day after day, and you will find it in your hands!
Phaidoari...
Afairrynghor!
It has been a while.
Quite a few years have passed since we last met, Professor Woodward.
Is that you, Chariot?
It appears the lost Claiomh Solais has been revived.
I see you were testing her.
Just as you did of me.
She's quite the stubborn one.
She revived a Word.
Phaidoari Afairrynghor.
Akko revived the first Word as well.
With this, she has also revived the second.
There are seven Words of Arcturus in total.
Revive the remaining Words.
Chariot.
You will aid her.
Akko, I promise to tell you the truth one day.
