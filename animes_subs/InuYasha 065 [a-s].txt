Huh?! What's this?
It's a powerful miasma.
Be careful! The evil is coming closer.
Where is it?! Just hurry and show yourself!
At your feet!
What is that?! The ground is melting!
Shippo!
Why, you!
Take this! Hiraikotsu!
Why, you!
Finishing blow!
Wait!
What?!
It can't fight anymore.
Why?! I was just about to have a good fight!
It was just big, and not much else.
What a letdown. His appearance was so deceptive.
But all's well and nothing could be better than that.
What's with them?
Thank you so much, traveling monk.
Our village has been tormented by that demon.
By that demon?
We shall have a feast for you to show our gratitude.
This was just part of my training.
I must decline.
I see. But it's too bad.
The pretty girls of the village eagerly await you.
But if that is the case...
Well, since you're being so kind,
Buddha will punish me if I don't accept.
Changing his mind because of the young girls.
He really is a lecher priest.
These beans are so delicious!
It's so yummy! They're great!
It's been so long since we've had such great food!
What's the matter, Sango? You haven't touched your food.
Hmm... I can see in your palm that you will be blessed with children.
Miss, will you be army children?
Y-Yes!
I'll have as many as you want.
Fifteen, sixteen... It makes no difference.
Now then!
H-Hey... Sango!
Don't just sit there and watch! Help me!
Why don't you father two, even three children?
Just do as you please.
Sango is scary!
Now, now!
Old woman, you're always so healthy.
I still can bear a child or two!
Even in this age, they had lively family communions.
That's nice to know.
What's a family communion?
Well...
Oh, moms, dads and grandparents and siblings all dining together and
enjoying each other's company.
Oh...
What's nice about that?!
Such bad manners!
If you lie down right after eating, you'll end up a cow!
Who cares?!
Myoga!
I was a bit concerned about you, Inuyasha.
So I came... only to find you battling a giant centipede.
I'm so glad you are okay.
When the fighting's on, you're nowhere to be found.
But you always appear at times like this.
What a schemer you are!
Oh, come now...
Where've you been, anyway?
Even an old one like me
has some secrets he'd prefer to keep.
You give me the creeps!
Hot! Hot!
I'm so full.
Quietly, silently... tippy-tippy-toe!
There it comes.
I've heard of child spirits lingering on
in an old mansion like this, but is that all this is?
W-What's!?
Wanna pee!
Stop!
Gotta pee!
Wait!
This is not the toilet!
My goodness... What a way to be awakened.
You want to pee again? You can go by yourself, can't you?
Sango...
Do you know what time it is?
She's come sneaking into my bed! Such luck!
Come and join me...
Don't tell me you're still angry about earlier?
The old woman was just joking!
What's all that ruckus?!
Sango! You don't have to be so angry!
She's sleepwalking.
Cripes! Can't you be more quiet when you fight?
Wait!
Sango is possessed!
Stop, Sango!
Stop it, Sango!
Sango!
Are you all right?
Huh?
Why am I here?
What happened, Miroku?
She slapped him before she came to.
There's no doubt that someone bewitched Sango.
I don't remember a thing.
But who would bewitch her?
I don't sense anything suspicious around here.
A-Are you sure?
Myoga! When did you hop onto Miroku?
Are you sure you don't sense anything suspicious?
I'll bet you're hiding something!
Err... no...
I remember...
Long ago, my father told me of demons who
realize their power for the first time after death.
For the first time after death?
The most recent demon we destroyed was...
Oh!
Then that weak, giant centipede is the culprit?
Then we must make sure it's permanently sealed again.
What's the matter, Myoga?
Nothing... It's nothing.
There!
It's just a carcass.
Nothing scary about it.
In any case, let's seal it with a sutra charm.
Kagome, you don't have any luck with men.
R-Really?
Unless you leave your current fellow,
you won't find peace or happiness.
What about you, Sango?
Hmmm... Let's see... Hmm... You're no better with men!
You'd better forget about him. He's too much of a womanizer.
Your palm-reading is right on the mark.
T-Think so?
What? Are you done with sealing the demon?
It's not over!
Stop slacking, Miroku!
Why you! Unforgivable!
What?!
What're you doing?! Is this payback for earlier?
So you've shown your true self!
You lecher monk!
I didn't think you were such a man!
I misjudged you!
I always knew!
That's not it!
This time, the spirit of the centipede has possessed Miroku!
No way!
Miroku shows no signs of being possessed
by such a strong power!
Shippo, run from here!
I don't need to be told that! Kirara!
You won't get away! Halt!
What?! What's going on?!
If I can't catch up to that little kid,
this body is useless!
What's with that accent, Miroku?!
That's why I said he's possessed!
Darn!
What was I doing?
Miroku! Are you the real Miroku now?
What? What are you talking about?
He has definitely returned to his old self, Inuyasha.
That's for sure.
Wait!
I feel something suspicious approaching.
Huh?
What's that?!
Could it be the mate of last night's centipede?
Is this the one who possessed us?
Kagome!
Be careful!
It's demon fluid!
Stay here!
Take this!
Wind Scar!
What a pesky centipede!
Let's put a sutra charm on it.
Now, everything is settled.
Inuyasha?
Inuyasha?!
Hold it! You won't get away!
Could Inuyasha be?!
The way he's running... he looks like a flea.
Flea?!
Wait, I say!
This time, it's Inuyasha?! What's happening?!
Wait, Myoga!
Inuyasha is calling you!
That is not Master Inuyasha.
What?
Stop, I said!
l-Inuyasha!
Don't think you can escape from me.
My body is all yours.
l-Inuyasha! Snap out of it!
You and I will get married.
I still have my own dreams!
I want to fall in love... and I want to declare my love!
Inuyasha! Sit!
What're you doing?! Kagome!
Inuyasha! You're back to normal!
Huh?
What did I do?
You stupid dog!
Inuyasha!
What are you holding?
Please let me go!
Myoga!
Please let me go, Inuyasha!
Kagome, it's a flea! An unfamiliar flea!
You're right.
It came out from Inuyasha's body.
This is my one wish of a lifetime!
Please let me go!
Myoga! It's the end of the line for you.
You cannot get away!
Who are you?
Oh dear... This is so embarrassing.
I'm called Shoga.
I'm betrothed to Myoga. Our parents arranged it.
N-No, she's wrong!
You be quiet!
Old Shoga, huh?
Don't call her old!
Oh, no... When a flea reaches my age,
she wants to settle down and have a family.
But this one...
From long ago, he's been such a womanizer!
Whenever there's a pretty woman...
He goes to check on her without a word...
And he leaves without a trace.
So I came after him this time,
sworn to take him back even if I must carry him on my back!
Scary!
Myoga, are you prepared?!
No! Please let me!
Please release me, Inuyasha!
No way!
Why?
You knew that this Old Shoga was the one who bewitched us!
Inuyasha, do you intend to steal my days of youth?!
What days of youth?!
I think I'd better tie you to my back!
Good idea!
Now, now... Old Shoga.
Forgive him.
Yes. If you're going to take Old Myoga's freedom,
you should stay here and get married.
Marry?!
Then you can start a life together!
Oh dear...
She's embarrassed!
She may be a flea, but she's still a female.
We'll ask the headman to be the go-between.
There's no need for the headman!
No! No!
Myoga doesn't seem pleased about it.
You have to resign yourself.
Become a fine flea husband and wife.
No!
Myoga... Now we are married at last!
He's so embarrassed!
You can at least say you love me.
Myoga?!
What's wrong?
What happened?!
Shoga?
Old Shoga?
This isn't Myoga!
He switched places with some roving flea!
That Myoga! He ran away!
Run! Run to the depths of Hell!
Why that old geezer! Wait!
You won't get away!
Run! Run!
Wait up!
That flea! When it comes to running away, he's the best!
Wait, Myoga!
No way!
Inuyasha... Can't you find Naraku's castle yet?
Don't talk to me! I can't concentrate!
This is the night of the new moon.
Is your sense of smell lost for this night?
Shaddup!
Huh?! This smell... It belongs to Koga of the Wolf-Demon Tribe.
And...
Not only that!
Kagura is making a deal with Sesshomaru!
Next on Inuyasha: Naraku's Barrier... Kagura's Decision
Damn, of all times!
