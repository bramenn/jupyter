Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
We're done!
Is it all right if we eat now?
Nurse's Office
Ah! What Do Talent and Hard Work Have to Do With It?
Good job!
Here.
Thanks!
You've improved greatly, haven't you?
Yeah. Thanks to everyone's hard work!
We're going to do really well this year, I bet.
Morisato! Here are your lap times.
On average, you took a whole second off this time!
Really? I guess I have you guys to thank for that!
Please, Morisato. No one else has improved as much as you have.
Morisato, I'm sure you have a talent for driving. You might be a genius!
A genius?
I don't think so!
Come on, I'm not trying to flatter you!
Hey! Hasegawa!
Yes!
Excuse me.
Miss Hasegawa is such a hard worker, isn't she?
Yeah, she isn't really the type to stand out, but she always gives it her all.
She's a real behind the scenes type, I guess you'd say.
You mean she's a backseat driver?
Uh, no... You mean she's a backseat driver?
That's not what I meant...
What? I can't do that! There's no way I can do that!
It's too late!
We already signed you up.
You didn't!
What's going on?
Morisato, just look at this!
Let's see...a go-kart race, female drivers only?
It's a new event they're introducing this year.
We've decided to participate in the race.
There's no way I can do it! We've decided to participate in the race.
There's no'no way' about it!
You're the only female member we have. We don't have any choice!
Why don't you give it a shot?
I think Keiichi's right.
Not you too!
Don't worry!
It's not going to be a tough race, since all the drivers will be girls.
It's not going to work out!
There's absolutely no way that I can race!
But why not?
I just know it! I know I can't do it!
Listen, you do know how to drive a regular car, don't you?
Well, yes...
Then, don't worry.
It'll seem like you're going really fast at first, but you'll realize...
But still!
A man's gotta have balls! Go on!
But I'm a woman... A man's gotta have balls! Go on!
Too...too fast!
O Spirit who exists in the Valley of Air... O Spirit who arrives with the Wind!
Air Bug Spiralee!
Stifle that vehicle's power!
The engine shut down!
Great, she got lucky!
Miss Hasegawa?
Are you afraid of riding this go-kart?
I'm terrified!
There's no way that I'm ever going to be able to drive that thing!
All right, looks like it's still intact, Den-chan!
But I don't know if we can keep it running until the race.
And we can't have Hasegawa getting hurt.
Yeah, I think you're right about that.
She'll be fine!
I'm certain that she'll be able to drive that kart!
Huh?
Belldandy?
Please, will you let me take care of this?
Boot camp, huh?
Well, I guess it's just like Belldandy to come up with something like that.
Whoops! I forgot to turn off Banpei!
What?
What...what in the world is this thing?
Please forgive us.
Sorry about that.
I'm fine, I'm fine! I'm just a little out of breath, that's all.
But anyway, that robot you made is very impressive! It's really amazing!
He is, isn't he?
If you can tell how awesome my Banpei is, you're amazing yourself!
Now, now, let's not get carried away.
Oh, you shut up!
Listen! You're here to train, aren't you? Then I'm going to help you out!
Huh? Oh, um...
I didn't know you had something like this right in your backyard.
Actually, this is the first time I've ever seen it myself.
Only one person would do this...
I made it! Only one person would do this...
I call it the Tariki Hongan Temple Race Circuit!
There's a super-tight curve at the first corner!
You've got to time your deceleration and acceleration perfectly!
Once you're through an S-shaped chicane...
You'll exploit the full potential of your machine!
And once you clear the last hill, it's just a straightaway to the finish line.
Well? Brilliant, wouldn't you say?
Um, we're just borrowing this place, you know.
Never mind the little details!
Time to practice!
If you can just master this course of mine, you'll have nothing to fear!
But I can't do it! It's beyond me, really!
Don't worry! Look at that!
My Voice-controlled Device, the'Aye-Aye-Sir' No. 1!
Just tell him what to do and he'll drive for you!
Hmm...
Too fast!
Aye, aye, sir!
No, what I meant was slow down! Stop, please!
Aye, aye, sir!
You should've just let me take care of this!
Come on, as if you could ever get it right, Urd!
Oh, wanna bet?
Ta-da! Industrial-strength Jekyll Hyde 500!
Not again!
The thing is, she's way too timid, and that's what we've got to fix!
This will reverse her personality!
In other words, she'll become super-aggressive!
Hasegawa?
Why don't you shut up? Get off my case!
Man, what a drag...
That potion reversed her diligent nature as well...
I knew you couldn't handle it, Urd!
It was just a little too strong for her. I'll just neutralize it with this!
Morisato!
I'm gonna go out now, so get all the shopping done before I come back!
Let's go, Dai-chan!
Was that Tamiya just now? Let's go, Dai-chan!
Well, it is supposed to turn her into the person who resembles her the least.
Oh, I get it...
What's the problem, Hasegawa?
I can't do it after all.
I'll never be able to go fast like you, Morisato!
Hasegawa...
I just don't have the talent for this, you see!
Neither do I...
Yes, you do. Look how fast you can make that kart go.
No matter how many times I try, I'm still scared!
Look, I'm just as scared as you. How can it not be scary?
Let's call it a day, then. Why don't you go wash your face?
All right.
Ouch!
All right, that should make it better.
Thank you very much.
There's just no way that I can do this.
Here you all are, trying to help me out, and I'm still not getting better.
I just keep messing up...
I know you can do it!
How in the world can you say that?
I've tried and tried with all my might and I've never once succeeded!
That can't be true.
Yes, it is true!
Miss Hasegawa...
Let's eat.
Tomorrow I'll see to it that you do better, I promise you!
Not gonna happen.
Oh, come on! Not gonna happen.
As if you didn't mess up yourself!
Did I, now?
What's the big idea?
Yuck... What's the big idea?
What is this slimy stuff that's sticking to my tongue?
I'm sorry. I'm the one who made it.
Huh?
I've been a terrible cook since I was a little girl.
They used to call me the Homicidal Chef...
My teacher put'Please have Sora practice cooking' on my report card.
All right, then please let me make dinner tonight.
That way, I can show you once and for all that no matter what I do...
Miss Hasegawa...
I went through intense training.
I had my mom teach me at home, and I practiced everyday.
But no matter what I do, I always fail. So please...
One more time...
Let's try it one more time.
One more time.
All right, please get on.
Um, where am I supposed to sit?
Right here.
What?
There?
All right, we're off!
Careful, now.
It's scary...it's scary after all!
Just because we're riding double doesn't make it any less terrifying!
A skylark.
If you're looking down at the ground, you'll lose sight of what's around you...
Look straight ahead and feel the wind.
And little by little, start talking to your machine...
Look straight ahead...
Look straight ahead...
Hey, is it all right if ride you?
I wonder if I'm good enough to?
I don't know.
Here she comes.
All right! She completed the course!
Good job, Hasegawa!
Thanks to you, Morisato.
You see? You can do anything if you try.
Don't act like such a hotshot when everything you did was useless.
What did you say?
You wanna fight? What did you say?
You little...
Here's to the end of training camp and Hasegawa's great achievements...
Cheers!
This is great!
Really?
I made that, you know.
Really, it's delicious!
All your hard training paid off, didn't it?
Yes!
Now all you have to do is to come in first tomorrow!
Huh?
Oh, yes, that's right.
Hey, why are you all spaced out? You know you're gonna win for sure!
Tomorrow...
Miss Hasegawa?
Miss Hasegawa...um...
Oh, I'm all right. I admit I'm still a little anxious, but...
I really appreciate all your support.
Well, then, good night!
It's going to be all right... this time...
I'll be all right...this time, for sure!
Miss Hasegawa...
Ready, set...
Right, we're set.
Where's Hasegawa?
What's holding her up? She's going to be late.
Miss Hasegawa, are you ready to go?
Yes.
Miss Hasegawa?
Miss Hasegawa!
I got a stomachache all of a sudden.
Oh, no! We have to get you to the doctor right away.
No, I think I'll be fine if I just lie down a while.
But...
What? Does that mean she's not going to be in the race?
After all that training, too.
It's just a stomachache, she's got to psyche herself out of it!
I'd like to ask a favor of you...
Would you please wait, just a little?
Miss Hasegawa, I've brought you some rice gruel.
Belldandy...
Yes?
When I was in grammar school, I practiced hard to learn how to cook.
I didn't want to make everyone else look bad at a presentation in home ec class.
I practiced and practiced and my friends all cheered me on.
And I did get a lot better.
My cooking started to taste a little better too.
But...
You feigned...your illness?
Yes.
Even though I practiced so hard, I was so scared that I might fail.
While I was resting in the nurse's office, tears started rolling down my face.
I was so frustrated, and so embarrassed. I was so ashamed of myself...
That's why I decided then and there that I'd never pull a stunt like that again.
But...
But?
But I'm still scared, after all!
Whenever I think that I might fail, it scares me so much I can't even move!
This is who you are right now.
Please, give her all of your support.
Please believe in her.
You've done so much to get to this point!
Belldandy...
But, Belldandy...
We all get scared.
But you never want to betray yourself, so you have to...
Why do you suppose Keiichi was able to improve his lap time?
What?
Not because of his talent.
But because he's trained so hard to overcome his fear and insecurities.
A genius?
I don't think so!
Look, I'm just as scared as you. How can it not be scary
If you're looking down at the ground, you'll lose sight of what's around you...
Morisato...
You've got one hour before the race starts.
Morisato!
All right!
I'm not going to look down at the ground anymore.
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a Wing!
I love you so much it hurts...
And it hurts me that I can't tell you how I feel.
You and I have matching hearts...
So we must share the same scars deep down inside.
But now that I'm in your arms, I think I can catch...
Nobody else matters... All we have to do is gaze at each other.
It's all right for your heart to flutter... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
Don't run away from happiness.
I'll always be waiting for you.
So come rest your wings anytime.
It's all right to cry... anytime you need to.
I just want to see you again... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
I just want you to be happy.
The sea...it is both the source of life, and a place to rest your soul.
Embraced by Nature, the goddesses bare their minds and souls.
