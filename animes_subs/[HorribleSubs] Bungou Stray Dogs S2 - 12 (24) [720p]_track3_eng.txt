Atsushi-kun!
I thought you weren't like that!
What's the matter?
I know.
Drink, Kunikida!
Here I go.
Good job!
You're quite a cheap drunk, aren't you?
Naomi-san!
You better take responsibility.
Kyouka-chan!
Despicable!
What?
I am.
I-I have a lot of work tomorrow.
Drink!
Wait, I -
I can't chug like that.
You... You...
N-Naomi-san, Tanizaki-san can't really take jokes!
Hear me out, Kyouka-chan!
Come!
Beast Beneath the Moonlight!
Rashoumon Demonic Armor!
Come on, now.
I don't want to have spent all that money on nothing.
Three minutes left.
Kyouka-chan, if you'd prefer, I can set you up with a life of killing.
But your anguish isn't yours alone.
What should one do, when what they want to be isn't what they're best at?
Everyone fights, searching for the correct way to live their lives.
What do they seek by fighting?
How ought they live?
No one can say.
All we have is the right to waver.
Like stray dogs that have hit rock bottom.
No!
Weretiger!
If he's right...
It is worthless.
The words of your past are fundamentally unrelated to who you are now.
If I may shed away my burden now, I will...
Die, weretiger!
I'm spent.
If he stands back up...
I won, Zelda.
Wait for me.
I'll bring you happiness once more.
Right, the control terminal.
You fool.
I took it from him during the last attack.
Dammit!
We need to stop it!
I'd love to rip you to shreds right now but, unfortunately, I've used up all my strength.
You'll have to make do with this.
You're going to pay for this when we next meet.
Descending?
It can't be.
I haven't done anything.
Hand it over.
It isn't responding.
Something's going on.
No good.
It isn't responding here, either.
It's going to fall!
That voice...
We're out of time.
We need to do something, or everyone's dead.
It's no use.
Someone has infiltrated from the outside.
They've taken control.
No.
There's still a way.
That voice...
Kyouka-chan?!
I heard about the situation.
Even if the Moby Dick can't be stopped from falling,
with enough force from above, it can be destroyed before it reaches the city.
I'll use this drone.
I see.
That's amazing, Kyouka-chan.
We can save everyone.
Prepare the parachutes, please.
You need to escape now, too.
I can't.
I'm captive here.
My ankles are chained down.
I can't make it to the evacuation system.
No...
Then...
Forget about me.
No!
I won't allow it!
Change course!
I didn't have a single ray of light until now.
But today, I understood. I have choices.
If I sacrifice myself to save everyone else, I'll pass the entrance exam.
I can really become a member of the Agency.
I would regret nothing.
Stop it!
Let go!
Akutagawa!
Kyouka-chan, listen to me!
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Kyouka-chan!
Why?
Why her?
Kyouka...
What a fool.
If she hadn't embraced the hope of living in light, she wouldn't have had to die in vain.
This is how it ought to have been, Atsushi-kun.
Dazai-san.
Boss?
Kyouka-chan overcame herself and saved the city.
With the high-mindedness expected of the Agency.
But there was no reason she had to die.
True, this is a merciless conclusion.
But there was a reason that it had to be this way.
My ability, All Men Are Created Equal,
has an effect only on my subordinates... That is, on members of the Agency.
The ability allows for control over the output of the abilities of another.
The reason you're able to control your tiger abilities now is because you joined the Agency.
And Kyouka-chan passed the entrance exam.
Right in the instant before the impact.
Do you understand what that means?
I used Demon Snow's katana to cut the chain and escape.
I'm back.
You're hurting me.
Sorry.
Sorry I kept it from you both.
If I hadn't, it wouldn't have made for a proper entrance exam.
Do we end in the mountains?
At sea.
Roger.
Was this all planned from the beginning?
The enemy's been defeated, and Kyouka-chan passed.
I'm glad it all worked out.
Dazai-san!
There's no one left to get in my way.
Please see my strength now.
I don't know.
You're at your limit now, aren't you?
You just defeated the Guild's leader, after all.
That's irrelevant.
I am
You've become strong.
Oh, whoops.
Nice view, isn't it?
You protected it.
It's your city.
Episode 24 If I May Shed Away My Burden Now
My city, huh?
The massive gifted war caused so much collateral damage in Yokohama.
And it's finally over.
But the government's work is just getting started.
Cleaning up after this huge mess...
I won't be sleeping at home for days.
Given that, we would very much appreciate having your help, Mr. Herman.
I just want to watch the sea for now.
With your information, we won't have to arrest Guild members who weren't part of this.
Do you think that a mere grunt like myself would have such information?
Yes.
You were the leader of the Guild two generations ago, after all.
It pains me that you young'uns always insist on bringing up the past.
Please help us overcome our sleep deprivation.
I don't need to use this, do I?
I never imagined the Moby Dick being underwater.
It was such a nice place.
The Moby Dick?
The Guild.
The boss is missing in action.
I hear there are even insurgencies within the Guild, now that we don't have a leader.
Looks like it's time to lower the curtain on our adventures here.
Yeah.
But life isn't over.
That's true.
I'm going to go back home and finish working on my biography.
What about you guys?
I'm going to look for Lord Francis.
I'm sure he's alive.
You're going back to your family, right, John?
I'm not.
I have to stop the insurgency in the Guild.
You?
That's a surprise.
I thought you hated the boss.
I do.
I hate anyone who controls people with money.
But he depended on his wealth to save his family, and this was the result.
I can't bring myself to just leave.
The contract...
is finally fulfilled.
You made it, huh, Lovecraft?
What's going to become of you now?
I sleep.
Who is that guy?
What does it matter?
He's one of my few friends.
Kyouka-chan.
Go ahead.
Ready, and...
Congratulations on joining the Agency, Kyouka-chan!
Cheers!
Atsushi.
How are your injuries?
I'm all better now.
Your actions have saved the city from destruction.
I thought I should say something, as your senior here at the Agency.
First of all, solo operations are an exception at group organizations such as ours.
Blah, blah, blah...
I won't tell you not to apply the experience you gained from this in the future,
but don't dare neglect the Agency's prime activities.
Likewise for Kyouka.
Be mindful of the fact that you are a member of the Detective Agency,
and act in a way that none would be ashamed of.
No kidding, Kunikida.
You're all such buzzkills.
Drink with me.
No, I'd rather not drink much.
Isn't there something you wanted to say?
You did well, the both of you.
All right, let's drink all night!
Please, no.
Are you telling me you can't drink with me?
Act in a way that none would be ashamed of, huh?
Haruno-san, Naomi-san.
I'm sorry.
I did some awful things to you thanks to Q's abilities.
It would never have happened if I'd known how unstable I was.
Oh, that?
I'm really sorry.
Atsushi-kun, that wasn't that bad.
We can't keep holding on to stuff like that here.
Really?
Yes.
Thank goodness.
There was something seriously wrong with me, to have done what I did to you.
Atsushi-kun.
I've never heard about this until now.
Atsushi-kun, what is this about?
Please, stay calm.
Rampo-kun, I brought the new piece that you inquired about over the phone.
I can't.
I'm damaged goods!
Kunikida!
N-Naomi-san?!
Yosano-sensei, I think you've had too much to drink.
Oh, hey.
Thanks for coming.
A-Atsushi-kun!
Do I really belong here?
Rampo-san, the boss wants you.
I'm from an enemy organization.
I'll be right back.
K-Kyouka-chan?!
Stay right there.
Rampo-kun.
What?!
Kunikida!
That was an impressive operation.
W-Wait, Kyouka-chan...
Don't make excuses, it's unmanly!
The Agency would be nothing without you.
What did you tell her, Tanizaki-san?
All the naughty things you did.
They seem to be having fun, huh, Karl?
He likes being left out?
It's a'64 Romane.
May I really?
Isn't it your treasure?
Is there a better day than today to open it?
To victory.
This is delicious.
Boss, how shall we punish Akutagawa?
Punish?
He was instrumental in our success.
Akutagawa-kun has always been this way.
He runs off by himself, he causes destruction and, in the end, he contributes the most.
He has a strong nose.
So long as he continues to succeed, there will be no punishment.
Say, Kouyou-kun, why did you not try to escape when you were captured by the Agency?
It ought to have been easy for you.
I wonder why.
Perhaps because the tea was so delicious.
Sister, let's make a deal, as two grown-ups.
I have a plan for saving Kyouka-chan.
What?
If we succeed, it'll be the only way to protect both her life and her dreams.
Dazai saw how it would all play out.
What a terrifying man.
Pfft.
Kouyou-kun, you are strong.
Now that your beloved Kyouka-kun is gone, it would be difficult for me to chase you down,
should you decide to leave the Port Mafia now.
Of course.
Sadly, I must help a clumsy leader with reestablishing the organization.
I'm grateful, but I deal only with those under twelve.
Silence.
I'll sew your lips shut.
Dazai!
You're so dead!
It's so cute!
Hey, where's Dazai-san?
What a weird painting.
I bet even I could do it.
Hirotsu-san, thanks for the help.
Did I do enough?
All I did was leak the Moby Dick infiltration route to Higuchi-kun.
If she knows, she will tell Akutagawa-kun.
If Akutagawa-kun knows, he will come in by himself.
It was as I expected.
Why did you go through all that trouble
to bring Akutagawa-kun together with the tiger boy?
I wanted to be sure.
For the real disaster that's about to come.
He's already on the move.
So the destruction of the Moby Dick was a failure.
Still, just about everything is according to plan.
We succeeded in creating strife within the Guild and recruiting talented gifteds.
I'm only helping for the time being to fulfill my end of the deal
and have Margaret brought back to consciousness.
That's fine by me, Pastor.
Fyodor D.
Ability: Crime and Punishment
Let us paint the land with the blood of the guilty together.
For a better world.
We won't be able to avoid going to war with that demon I've fought in the past.
Akutagawa-kun is formidable enough by himself,
but his abilities are most valuable in a supporting role.
In complementing a forward attacker such as Atsushi-kun,
with his speed and toughness, he could be a powerful ally.
We'll need to be more powerful than before in order to fight with that demon.
Something more powerful than the former Double Black.
That's those two.
Dazai-kun, why do you value Yokohama so dearly?
My friend said me...
You might as well side with the people who save others.
That's at least a little more beautiful.
Teni Muhou.
The city we protected.
Worthless nonsense.
This city became my home, with all the people here.
