Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
Amazingly, it turns out Lucy is the daughter of the Heartfilia Konzern!
How surprising...
Phantom Lord was after her, but thanks to the master invoking Fairy Law, our battle with them is finally over.
However...
It'll be all right! I'll yell it out countless times.
I believe your every tomorrow will be shining.
The intersection of all people
Never giving up. And that's why we're not gonna lose!
When it seems like you'll be blown away by the headwinds,
grasp this hand, try to take a chance.
Because you're not alone anymore, got it?
Go forward, more and more!
Don't give up on your awesome dream!
That's right, don't cry!
Move on, my way!
Now, with the light shining down upon you.
Don't even think about something like giving up!
Even if you trade being hurt again for strength.
Your eyes, always looking straight ahead,
can surely see the light!
Everyone seems really happy, Lucy.
Yeah...
Lucy?
My Resolve.
Hey, can you hear me, Gajeel?
I can't hear nothin'.
So hey, where'd you learn Dragon Slayer magic?
I said I couldn't hear you!
I've never met anyone who used the same magic as me.
You could at least tell me that much!
Oh, shut it.
Metalicana.
The Iron Dragon, Metalicana.
What?
I knew it! You were taught by a dragon?
You too?
So where is it now?
Who knows?
Where is it now?!
I said I didn't know!
Man...
Just talkin' to you makes my brains turn to mush.
Say that again!
It disappeared.
One day, Metalicana suddenly vanished.
Without saying a thing.
Man... What a selfish jerk.
Wait, that wasn't 7 years ago on July 7th, was it?
Wait... Do you know where Metalicana is?
Not a chance. I'm looking for Igneel, a fire dragon.
He also disappeared 7 years ago on July 7th.
7 years ago...
Year 777, Month 7, Day 7...
On that day two dragons disappeared...
Why is it a bunch of sevens lined up?!
How the hell should I know?
Not like I care anyway.
If you're leavin', then scat already.
This is our guild!
You're the one that should get out!
Man, why so picky?
Get out now!
Give me a call if you find anything about Igneel,'kay?
Why the hell should I be nice to you, huh?
Because we're both Dragon Slayers!
Don't give me that crap! Next time we meet, I'll kick your ass!
I guarantee it!
Make sure you've said your prayers.
You're dangerous, you know that?
I thought we could call it even now and make up...
You're the one that's dangerous!
Just look at what you did to our guild!
Well, you busted up our guild first!
I knew it! I give up makin' nice with you!
They've really made a big mess now...
U-Um... Master...
You've really had a tough time, I know.
Don't give us that face, Lu-chan!
We're back!
Levy-chan!
Everyone worked together to beat them.
Although the guild was destroyed.
We all just need to rebuild it.
Oui.
You guys...
Sorry for making you worry, Lu-chan.
No! This is all my...
I heard.
But nobody thinks this is your fault, Lu-chan.
On the other hand... I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.
Lucy.
Fun things, sad things... We can't share everything,
but what we can, we should share...
That's what it means to be a guild.
A single person's happiness is everyone's happiness.
A single person's anger is everyone's anger.
And a single person's tears are everyone's tears.
You have no reason to feel guilty.
Lucy... You should be able to tell how everyone feels...
Raise your head!
You're part of the Fairy Tail family.
Although...
We went a bit overboard...
This is going to seriously anger the Council...
Or wait, if it goes poorly, maybe even imprisonment...
Master!
And so...
It's been one week since our battle with Phantom ended.
We've finally gotten back our peaceful days...
Everyone, let's take a break!
Although after it happened, it's been super tough.
We were rounded up by the Council's army, the Rune Knights.
This ain't good...
They've already caught wind?
Run for it!
Aye, sir!
That's not going to work Natsu. You can't get away from the Rune Knights.
Master, hang in there!
We were dragged to the army post to be interviewed about what had happened.
Every day they'd question us, but finally after a week, it calmed down.
It seems like Fairy Tail's punishment will be handed down from the Council at a later date.
But, don't worry Mom.
I don't think it'll be that bad of a punishment.
Since the circumstantial evidence and witness reports all point to an attack from Phantom.
I hope these bruises goes away...
So, Mom... Do you think he was behind the whole thing, pulling the strings?
I know what he's like, but to go this far...
No, he'd do it. He wouldn't have any problem with this.
But why would he suddenly try and take me back?
It's not like he cares about me personally.
Mom...
He'll do it again, won't he? Using the power of his money...
That...
Oh, my...
That's'cause you tried to carry so many at once, idiot.
What'd you call me?
You wanna go?
You're carrying them so daintily!
Gray-sama, carry me too!
You, over there!
Less talking, more working!
We're going to rebuild Fairy Tail ASAP!
'Kay...
Erza's really into it...
She can requip to an outfit like that?
Master's also really getting into it!
He sure is!
Foreman, where do you need this timber?
Oh, over there!
Who is she calling foreman?
Damn it! I hate losing!
Ooh, it's whack-a-mole!
Wait...
Isn't it kind of big?
While we're at it, we're expanding.
See? Here's what it'll look like when it's finished.
Seriously?
Let's have a look.
It would be fine without changing it.
What kind of guild is it going to be like?
This is another...
I don't really get it.
But man, this is really crappy. What idiot drew this?
Oh, it was Mira-chan!
You made her cry again.
And such is Gray.
That's right! Gray-sama is only kind to Juvia!
I'm starving!
Aye!
Time to eat?
What's this?
I'm soaked!
It's a lunch box!
A lunch box?
That looks good!
I know! This is called a character lunch!
Can I actually eat something this insane?
It's dripping something...
Then give it to me!
Juvia is heartbroken! She took 3 days and nights straight to make it!
Who said you could eat?
Is that one of those character lunches?
This isn't bad. Give me some more.
Really? I'll eat it too.
Yum! So delicious!
I want to eat it everyday!
Which means... Will you marry me?
Yes! I'll give you 30 babies or more!
Juvia's overwhelmed!
Natsu, Gray, Erza...
Would you give these to Lucy?
They're her keys.
It's you.
I was wondering where you'd gone off to.
You've been searching for these the whole time?
Are you okay? You don't look good at all.
Thanks. I'm fine.
Sheesh... It's hard being a male feminist...
Lucy isn't here. Her injuries hurt so bad she can't move, maybe...
Maybe we should go check on her.
You come too, Loke.
I'll pass.
You know I can't handle Celestial Wizards.
Really?
But Lucy's still Lucy.
Natsu. We all have our weaknesses.
Don't pry.
Karen...
Must you be in such a rush? I...
Lucy!
You feelin' okay?
Don't come in through the window!
Enter through the door, people. The door.
And what the hell are you doing?
Aye.
Huh?
She'd usually be all...
This is my room!
In the bath?
Gray, you perv!
Something like this was bound to happen eventually...
Pardon the intrusion!
She ain't here.
That's not how it's supposed to go! And get out of there!
Maybe she's out?
Why did you come here, again?
Your straight-man act is lame.
Without Lucy our tempo is all off.
Quit finding fault! And oh, I'm so sorry I suck at comedy.
Lucy!
Hey, you...
What are you people doing?
There's underwear like this?
Underwear? That?
When would you wear such a thing?
When you're eatin'?
No way, no how.
Wait, this is dangerous.
Close the drawer already.
Lucy, come out!
Where have you been searching?
What're these?
Letters?
Mom, I finally joined the guild of my dreams, Fairy Tail...
Hey, don't go reading those!
Today, I met a person named Erza. She's cool and pretty. Then Natsu and Gray...
Are these all letters to her mother?
Looks like it.
I wonder why she didn't send them?
She left a note.
Look, Lucy left a note.
I will go home.
It seems.
Say what?!
Look! I made your face on a rice ball, Dad!
I made it! Eat up and work hard,'kay?
I'm working. I'll deal with you later.
Okay...
So I'll leave it right here. Eat it later,'kay?
And you see, today it's, um...
Did you not hear me?
I'm sorry!
Um...
I said you were bothering me, Lucy!
Our personal chef cooks our food!
If you have time to do that, then you have time to learn something about running an empire!
Understand? Now leave.
Um... Today is...
Mrs. Spetto!
Madame Lucy!
I'm so glad you're okay, Madame L... Madame L...
I'm sorry for worrying everyone.
M'lady, we have some new reference books from the East...
M'lady, how you've grown... Run off with a lover or two have you?
Have you been keeping up with your magic studies?
I can't believe we get to see you again, M'lady!
There go the waterworks...
You're all the same as ever, I see.
M'lady... M'lord asks you come to the study at the main residence.
He tells his daughter that ran away and came back to report to him?
He hasn't changed either, it seems.
I'd forgotten...
When I lived here, I would wear clothes like this.
Is it too tight?
It's gotten a little small for you, however.
Don't worry.
Oh yeah... I've gotten taller...
Well, I'll be off.
Right!
It's Lucy. I have returned, Father.
Come in.
So you have finally returned, Lucy.
Father...
I apologize for running away from home without saying anything.
I truly regret those actions.
You have made a wise decision.
As long as you are in that guild, I must use my wealth and influence to crush it.
You have finally matured, Lucy.
It seems I've made you realize how much trouble your selfish actions cause for those around you.
You are the daughter of the Heartfilias.
You are not like other people.
You live in different worlds.
It is fortunate that you finally understand this, Lucy.
There is only one reason I've had you returned. A very fortunate event.
A marriage with the son of the Jurener family has been proposed.
Yes... I figured it was something like that.
A marriage with the Jurener family will allow the Heartfilia Railways to make solid strides to the south.
This marriage with ensure our future fortune.
Our fortune?
And you must give birth to a boy.
So he can become heir to the Heartfilia estate.
That is all.
Return to your room.
Father.
You seem to be mistaken.
I have returned in order to show you my resolve.
It's true that I was wrong to leave without saying anything.
It was no different than simply running way.
So this time, I'm going to tell you exactly how I feel before I leave!
Lucy!
There is nothing fortunate about having your fate decided for you!
You must grab your own happiness yourself!
I'm going to walk my own path.
Don't go deciding on who I'll marry.
And...
Do not lay a finger on Fairy Tail again!
The next time you do...
If you hadn't done that, maybe we could be a bit more civil.
But it's too late now.
You have hurt my friends far too much.
What I want isn't money, or pretty dresses, or fortune forced upon me...
I'm not Lucky Lucy of the Heartfilias any more...
Fairy Tail is my other family now, and they recognize me just as Lucy!
It's a far more loving family than this!
I only lived here a little while, but leaving the home I lived in with Mother was incredibly difficult.
Mr. Spetto, Old Man Belo, Mr. Ribbon, Mrs. Aed...
It'll be really hard to leave them all...
But...
But, you see...
If Mom was still alive...
I think she'd tell me You go do what you want to do.
Layla...
Farewell, Dad.
Mom...
Now then...
Lucy!
Lucy!
Why?!
I'm really sorry I worried you all.
Don't worry, it's our fault for jumping to conclusions.
I guess we were worried for nothing.
Happy was crying the whole time.
You were sobbing too, Natsu!
N-No I wasn't!
I'm sorry, really...
But sheesh, what a spacious town.
It's so calm and peaceful.
Oh, this isn't a town. It's our garden.
Our land goes all the way to that mountain over there.
Huh?
What's the matter, everyone?
All Hail, Princess Lucy!
Said it like it's nothin'!
Natsu and Gray have been beaten!
Captain Erza, please, give your orders!
The sky sure is blue...
Captain Erza's malfunctioning!
To Mom up in Heaven, I'm doing well.
You know what Mom? I don't think I can live without my friends.
Since Fairy Tail is already a part of me!
All we've been doing is fighting lately... We'd better do some jobs, or we're in trouble!
I wonder if there's some rough job with a good reward that you can do, Natsu?
I can do delicate work, too!
Not your style.
Alrighty then, let's do it!
It's not your style!
You don't have to repeat it!
Next time: Next Generation!
And wait, do you even know what delicate means?
Uh, sure I do.
It's where you don't have to punch things...
Swing and a miss.
