Bell-kun,
has something good happened to you?
You could tell?
I think anyone could, just from your expression.
What happened?
Well, when my status updated...
I said, I'm looking for a party to join!
You've got to know of a few that are recruiting, right?
I don't
Level 2 in a month and a half?!
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Welf Crozzo Blacksmith
Level 2, huh?
I really beat a minotaur!
It's over, Bell-kun.
Did I just go up a rank now?
Nothing feels different...
Th-This power! It's overwhelming!
Is that what you were expecting?
Yeah. A little.
Well, you'll feel it soon enough.
Anyway, I've got good news.
Want to hear it?
What is it?
It's a skill.
Your secondum, never mind...
You know.
One of those skills you wanted has finally appeared.
Argonaut.
A skill!
I've got a skill!
I did it!
I did it, Goddess!
To think that it'd be Argonaut... The desire to be a hero.
What does that mean, exactly?
If you get a skill like this, it means...
Bell-kun, aren't you a little old to want to be a fairy tale hero?
No, um...
Bell-kun!
You're so cute!
Goddess, you meanie!
Anyway, it's true that you've gained a skill.
Now, try to figure out how it works in combat.
Okay.
I'm heading out.
Cheer up before I get back, would you?
Where are you going?
Today is the day when the gods meet.
Denatus, held once every three months.
Then that's...
That's right, Bell-kun.
We choose titles for adventurers who've leveled up.
That means you'll be getting a title.
Hey, Hestia.
Oh, it's you, Take.
I heard your kid's up to Level 2?
And in a little over a month?
Y-Yeah, I guess.
Wow. Even the Sword Princess took a year.
It's all the gods are talking about these days.
Come to think of it,
someone in your Takemikazuchi Familia leveled up, too, right?
Yeah. A child named Yamato Mikoto.
So I'm taking today's Denatus seriously.
Their title depends on it!
You're right.
Let's both win good titles...
Maybe I'll get some new armor to go with my title.
I wonder what kind of cool title I'll get?
Fire Blizzard?
Tornado Typhoon?
Burning Fighting Fighter!
Aw, yeah right...
This armor was good stuff.
It was light and easy to move in.
Welf Crozzo, huh?
Bell-kun! Bell-kun!
You're going to love this, Bell-kun!
Goddess!
Then...
I did it! I got something normal.
Huh?
Little Rookie?
Is that your title, Bell-sama?
Yeah.
Whaddya think, Lili?
Um... well, I guess it's...
Normal?
I know, right?
My goddess said it was nice and normal, but...
I like the title Little Rookie.
Congratulations for leveling up, Cranel-sama.
Please drink all you like tonight.
This is your party, after all.
Hey, is that him?
The guy who got to Level 2 faster than anybody else?
Are they talking about me?
Yes.
It's just what happens to adventurers who get famous.
Just think of it as getting popular.
Now let's get started.
R-Right?
Hey, is it okay for you two to be here?
Mama Mia said you could borrow us, so please drink
and have a good time.
Spend lots of money, too.
Okay, I will.
Cheers!
So you two are planning to head
into the middle levels of the dungeon, yes?
Right.
Of course, we'll see how it goes, but...
I see.
I hate to sound like I'm meddling,
but you should avoid going deeper than the 13th Floor for now.
Do you think that Bell-sama and I can't handle the middle floors?
No, that's not what I mean at all.
But the upper and middle floors are very different.
The strength of the monsters, their numbers,
and the encounter rate change.
The issue isn't your ability.
You can't hope to handle them all alone.
You should expand your party.
But...
I don't know anyone who'd join my party.
Having trouble with your party, Little Rookie?
If you want someone to go with, how about joining us?
We're all Level 2.
We can handle the middle floors, too.
But in exchange,
lend us these beautiful elven girls.
Friends should share, after all.
Right?
Listen...
Begone.
You are not worthy of him.
Calm down, Miss Fairy.
You'll have more fun with us than this stupid kid.
Don't touch me.
I won't allow you to insult my friends.
You bitch!
You may be a woman, but I won't go easy on you!
If you want to cause trouble, do it outside.
This place is for eating and drinking.
We're leaving!
Dumbass! I'm not putting it on your tab!
R-Right!
Not this.
Not this either.
Maybe he doesn't sell his work anymore...
I said, why do you keep putting them in the corner?!
I'm risking my life to do this!
Can't you treat me a little better?
Are you looking for something?
Oh, yes.
Did you stop selling Welf Crozzo-san's armor?
Huh? Um...
If you're looking for Welf Crozzo's armor,
I've got it right here.
I can't believe the Little Rookie
everybody's talking about came to buy my armor.
And I didn't think I'd get the chance to meet you in person, Crozzo-san.
Hey, would you mind not calling me Crozzo-san?
I can't say I care for it.
Then... Welf-san?
Welf-san, huh? Guess it'll do for now.
So, Bell Cranel.
You've come to buy my work twice now!
That makes you a regular customer, right?
I guess it does.
Sorry'bout that.
Just a little bit of a turf war.
So, Bell,
want to make a direct contract with me?
A direct contract?
I'll only work for you,
and make weapons, armor... Whatever you want.
But...
In return, you can help me out with something.
Of course, I'll properly thank you for it.
What is it?
Let me join your party.
I'm finally on the 11th Floor!
Sorry to make you do this for me so soon, Bell.
Oh, no.
If this is what it takes for you to get the Blacksmith ability,
it's important to me, too, since we've got a contract.
Well, I'm sure it's great for him, but...
Why doesn't he go adventuring with his own familia?
Oh, well you see, Lili...
Welf-san's, well...
He doesn't get along with his familia, right?
You believed his sob story,
and he bribed you with new armor.
Why didn't you talk to me first?
Sorry.
Am I that much of a problem, Li'l Shrimp?
My name isn't Li'l Shrimp, it's Liliruca Arde!
Oh! Nice to meet you, then, Li'l Lili!
Ugh, forget it!
But, Lili, I really like the armor that Welf Crozzo makes.
So...
Crozzo?
Did you just say Crozzo?
Y-Yeah...?
As in, the cursed magic weapon blacksmiths?
The fallen blacksmith nobles?
What do you mean?
You've never heard about it, Bell-sama?
The Crozzo family was a clan of blacksmiths
famous for their ability to make powerful magical items!
But one day they lost all their abilities,
and now they're completely destitute.
Yeah, it's the name of some broke nobles.
That doesn't matter now, does it?
But...
Either way, now's not the time to talk about it.
Okay, leave the orc to me.
Even I'm good enough to hit him.
Then I'll help as best I can, too.
I thought you didn't like me, Li'l Lili.
Of course I don't.
I just don't want to get in Bell-sama's way.
Okay, thanks.
I've got them!
They're so slow.
No...
I've gotten faster!
Wow.
Welf-san, Lili, dodge!
Firebolt!
My magic's stronger, too.
I'm getting closer. I can feel it!
To her... To Aiz Wallenstein!
Bete, outta my way!
Don't blame me if I slice you in half!
Like your slow-ass weapon could hit me!
What's got them so worked up?
The others won't learn anything from this.
It seems an adventurer they saw on the way down got under their skin.
Oh, they met a merry adventurer before our groups met up?
Yes.
His name is Bell Cranel.
I'm going, too.
Aiz?
Looks like she's also fired up.
It really is nice to be in a party.
Yeah.
Moving around feels so much easier.
That's one of the benefits of partying up.
You've got more room to breathe.
The way you move and deal with monsters changes, too.
Looks like other parties are starting to show up.
Once Li'l Lili gets our magic stones,
let's eat.
We can leave the monsters to them.
Hey, Bell, what's that?
What is this?
Oh, crap! It's a baby dragon!
Run!
Where's Lili?
Lili!
Run, Li'l Lili!
Firebolt!
No doubt about it.
That was your Argonaut skill.
It's the possibility to overcome any difficulty.
For a stupid kid who wants to be a hero, it's the ticket to pulling that off.
In the face of overwhelming power,
you can resist with that one little attack.
Like a hero, you can smite an enemy in a single blow.
Perfect for someone desperate to be a hero, like you, right?
Come to think of it, Goddess...
Have you ever heard of some noble blacksmiths named Crozzo?
That's your blacksmith's family name, isn't it?
I know they used to make a lot of magic items, but that's about it.
I see.
But I heard a little about that particular blacksmith at the shop.
It seems he can make magic items.
And pretty strong ones, too.
His familia says he's wasting his talent.
Why?
He won't make any.
If he did, he could have wealth and honor,
but for whatever reason, he absolutely refuses.
He's talented, but it's like he's hiding something.
That's what people say about your contract blacksmith.
Is Li'l Lili off today?
Yeah.
She says the gnome who runs the place where
she's staying is sick, so she wants to take care of him.
So I'm sorry, but today...
Oh, I see.
Hey, Bell-kun, would you mind coming with me today?
I promised you if you let me into the party I'd thank you, right?
I'll make you all-new equipment.
So this is your workshop?
Sorry it's so filthy.
Just try to put up with it.
Oh, no, it's fine.
Anything you want?
Equipment you want to try, maybe?
Oh, no... Just the light armor is more than enough.
You should be greedier, Bell.
An adventurer's job is to be as prepared as he possibly can be.
Am I wrong?
No, you're right...
Can I touch this?
Sure.
Nobody would buy it.
Really?
But it's a good sword...
What is it?
Were you hoping for a magic item?
You heard from your goddess, Hestia-sama,
that I can make magic items, right?
I heard she was asking around about me.
S-Sorry...
No, it's fine.
I'm under contract with someone in her familia,
so I understand how she feels.
But I was worried you might change your attitude
once you learned more about me.
Sorry to test you like that.
Oh, no...
So as for what I'm going to make...
Is that a drop item?
Yes, it's a minotaur horn.
I just couldn't bring myself to let it go.
Should I use that, then?
Use it?
I can use it to make a new piece of equipment for you.
You can do that?
Sure can.
Please!
I don't like magic items.
I used to have plenty of customers.
But they were all people who learned
that I was a Crozzo, and asked me for magic items.
I really got sick of them.
They want a tool to make them stronger. To make them famous.
Everybody said the same thing.
But that's not right.
That's not what a weapon should be.
It's not just a tool, or a way to get famous.
A weapon is part of its wielder.
No matter how bad things get,
your weapon will never betray you.
That's why I don't like magic items.
They'll shatter and leave their wielder behind.
Their power wastes human talent.
Neither a wielder nor a smith can take pride in them.
So now, I don't make magic items.
It's probably because the material was good.
It's without a doubt the best thing I've ever made.
Okay, let's give it a name.
Ushiwakamaru? No, since it's a minotaur dagger, maybe Mino-tan?
No, no, no!
The first one's fine, isn't it?
You like Ushiwakamaru, Bell?
There's no need to question it all.
I see.
Ushiwakamaru it is, I guess.
Here.
Thank you, Welf-san.
We've only known each other for a few days,
so I won't ask you to trust me completely.
But...
Treat me more like a companion, like Li'l Lili does.
All right, Welf.
Okay. Let's go over this one last time.
Once we pass through, we'll be on Floor 13, a middle floor.
The monsters down there will attack from a distance, using fire and other projectiles.
Even if they aren't nearby, never let down your guard.
Yeah.
We're going to use a standard formation.
Welf-sama will be in the front.
Bell-sama will be in the middle, where the stress is greatest.
That leaves me in the rear.
But please keep in mind that a supporter doesn't really
have the firepower to cover the rear alone.
What's so funny, Bell?
Bell-sama!
Aren't you taking this seriously?
Sorry, sorry.
But isn't this exciting?
We're all working together and going on an adventure!
You're right, yeah!
If you can't get excited, you're not a man!
I'm not sure that I agree with that...
But I understand how you feel.
It's okay.
I'm not alone.
They may not be from my familia,
but I have companions.
Are we ready, then?
Yeah, let's go!
Yeah!
