Hey, Nana. Do you remember the first time we met?
I'm the type who believes in things like fate.
So I think it was fate.
You can laugh if you want.
You have a new message Unopened messages: 1
Dear God! Great Buddha! Demon Lord!
Shoji The sakura has blossomed
All right!
E-Excuse me, this...
Nana! What are you shouting for?
Oh, you want to return that?
This man will be happy to help you.
Nana?
From this moment on,
I'll have you know, I am no longer working here.
You're quitting?
Thank you for all that you have done for me this past year,
and do give my regards to the manager.
Oh, and tell him to be sure to transfer the rest of the pay he owes me
into my bank account.
Well then. Be well. I'll see you around!
Nana!
It's spring! Spring has finally come!
After the long wait, spring has arrived!
I got into my top-choice University! Yay! Call me.
I got into my top-choice University! Yay! Call me. Oh I can't wait to see you, Shoji.
I got into my top-choice University! Yay! Call me.
When I was darkness at that time
With trembling lips
The more I struggle
The more this wound deepens
The broken promise hurt me
Nobody can save me
God, I have only one request
Stop tearing apart my love
I need your love
I'm a broken rose
Sorrow tumbling down is your song
All alone with nowhere to go in my life
I need your love
I'm a broken rose
Oh baby, help me from frozen pain
With your smile, your eyes, and sing me, just for me
I wanna need your love
I'm a broken rose
I wanna need your love
Well then, in celebration of Shoji's acceptance into university...
- Cheers! - Cheers!
I am so happy for you.
Wasn't it worth working hard that extra year after failing the first time?
Stop bringing that up!
No, really. I'm happy for you, too.
I thought for sure you'd fail again.
You too?
What did you say, Koichi Sato?!
Hello? Nana?
What if it isn't her?
Did you get my email?
Thanks.
I guess that's proof he hasn't been fooling around.
There's no way he could ever cheat on her. It's not in him.
Yeah. I'm just having a drink with Kyosuke and Junko at the Junction.
That's right, the bar I'm always telling you about.
How about you, Nana? What are you doing?
I was packing.
Nana says she's on her way to Tokyo.
- Yes?! - Yes?!
To Dad and Mom, I'm going to Tokyo! I'll be in touch as soon as I find a place, so please send me the boxes in my room.
I'll find new, fancy furniture in Tokyo, so just leave the furniture in my room as is.
I'll be back from time to time! Say hi to Nao and Nami for me. See you, Nana
One ticket to Tokyo. One way. Non-reserved seating!
None of the trains are on schedule because of the snow.
That's okay. As long as I get there.
March 519:30 I'll meet your train.
What time are you arriving? Which train? Let me know and I'll wait for you at the platform! Am I nice or what? Shoji.
Shoji.
Thank you for using the Tohoku bullet train today.
- Due to the snow, the train's departure,., - What's this? It's packed.
- was delayed by forty minutes. - I wanna find a seat quickly,
so I can email Shoji.
Um...
Um, excuse...
What? Why did it suddenly stop? An accident?
Are you all right?
I'm fine. Sorry.
I'm sorry too. You got flattened by this, didn't you?
I'm fine.
Er... By the way... Is this seat open?
Go ahead.
What a beautiful person. More like, so cool.
She has an aura different from that of a commoner.
She's skinny and has a small face. Could she be a celebrity?
And such long eyelashes!
I envy how the loud makeup looks good on her.
Beautiful people look great, no matter what they do.
Wow, a well-worn Vivienne Westwood ring!
So cool!
Sorry. Is the smoke bothering you?
No, I'm totally fine.
It's not moving.
The train. It's been running like this for a while now.
Is that so? What am I gonna do? I'm in a hurry.
Really? That's a problem.
No, it's all right.
I'll send an email.
Okay!
Wow, you're really fast!
I'm amazed at what high school students can do nowadays.
But I'm twenty years old.
Sorry. Then I guess we're the same age.
She's so cute when she laughs.
What? The same age? No way, you don't look it. That's fraud!
The way you said high school students nowadays
makes you seem a lot older!
Yeah, it's a habit. I live in the analog world.
An announcement to our passengers.
Due to the snow, we will be proceeding at low speeds for a while.
We apologize for the inconvenience
- this delay is causing you. - No way!
How long is it gonna take us to get to Tokyo?
What is the purpose of your stay in Tokyo?
Nothing in particular.
I'm moving there. I'll look for a job in Tokyo.
Really. Same for me.
What, you're moving there too?
Really? I thought you were from Tokyo.
So you're not returning home from a tour around the country.
A tour?
Like concerts. You have a guitar, after all.
I figured you were a professional musician.
So, are you in a band?
Back in my hometown I was.
That's so cool! Where is your hometown?
An email.
Or, no, it's the phone.
Hello, Nana here.
Oh, Shoji? Yeah, that's right.
The train has stopped. I've got no idea when we'll arrive.
Huh? You sure? But it could be around midnight.
You sure it's okay?
Thanks.
Then I'll call you again when I know what time we're arriving.
Bye-bye.
Is your boyfriend from Tokyo?
You sure are lovey-dovey.
I get it. So you're chasing after a guy who moved to Tokyo.
You're wro-!
Well, I guess you're right about that.
Which is it?
Well, he's not from Tokyo.
We went to the same college at our hometown.
But he came to Tokyo a year ago to study art.
Why didn't you go with him then?
I told him that I'd go too.
But Shoji... He insisted I shouldn't.
Why's that?
Because I have no objective or money.
He says it's not wise to make such a move without a plan.
I see.
So I tearfully stayed back and saved up money to make the move.
We made a promise that if Shoji passed
the entrance exams to University, then I'd move to Tokyo!
When I get to Tokyo, I'm gonna find a job
and give every effort so he doesn't tell me to go home!
Say... What am I doing telling all this to a stranger?
A total stranger! What's wrong with that?
Tell me more.
From the look of things, we've got lots of time.
Yeah, you have a point.
Then, will you hear me out so we can kill time together?
To be honest, I was dying to talk to someone about him.
His name's Shoji, and he's kind, reliable, and pretty cool.
But when he talks, he acts like a fool.
Like a fool?
Hey, wanna have some beer?
Sure, I would.
Two beers please!
Okay, then. Let's make a toast.
A toast to what?
Well...
To Shoji passing the University exams!
No. that has nothing to do with me.
Then, can we at least drink to this unique moment?
Hey, I like that.
To two girls, the same age,
arriving in Tokyo at the same time on the same train.
That's quite a coincidence, don't you think?
And to one more thing.
My name is Nana too, Nana.
Do you remember the first time we met?
Before we knew it, there was a snowstorm outside.
The train was stop and go all the way,
and it took us five hours to get to Tokyo.
But I wasn't at all bored.
I kept talking about myself
and didn't bother to ask about you at all.
But knowing you,
you likely would've just changed the subject or something, anyway.
Nana!
Shoji!
Why are you crying?
You're so mean to be laughing!
You really had a tough time. Five hours, right?
But you know...
What's the matter?
I became friends with the girl sitting next to me.
Oh?
But she's not here, even though we got off the train together.
Has she already left?
I should've given her my cell number and stuff.
You didn't do that?
Then you can hardly call yourself friends.
Don't cry. Kyosuke and Junko are waiting downstairs.
Jun-chan!
There's no snow on the ground in Tokyo.
So. What do you want to do?
Wanna go have a drink?
But I gotta tell ya, I'm really tired.
And it's one o'clock in the morning.
Well then, I guess that means we'll go home directly.
I'm really sorry.
I mean, you guys came all the way out here to meet me and all.
Hey, there's no reason for concern.
We can get together any time we want to now.
We'll take a rain check on the party.
It feels so good to be together, the four of us.
Just like old days back at our specialty school.
More than just a nostalgic feeling, a sense of relief.
It's like this is my second family.
Here I am finally, in Tokyo, with all of you.
See you!
Good night.
Huh?
What are you doing, Nana? Let's go.
Ah, right.
Shoji Endo
Shoji Endo Wait a minute.
Is it all right to be staying over...
- like it's the natural thing to do? - Come on in.
Though the place is a mess since you came on sudden notice.
Sorry'bout that.
Huh?
I'm being a bother by suddenly coming like this, aren't I?
I was hoping to stay with Jun-chan until I found my own place.
But that wouldn't be too considerate, would it?
Those two are living together now.
I had no idea! Jun-chan never told me!
Since when?!
I wonder.
It was like, before I know it, Kyosuke had moved to Junko's place.
I see. I never knew.
Hey, you've still got your shoes on!
Tokyo is not a foreign country, you know!
They always did have the composure of a middle-aged couple.
Middle-aged couple?
I guess they just bonded more after moving here.
That's totally great!
What?!
Hey, are you taking my clothes off already? You pervert!
I wonder, can Shoji and I gradually become like that too?
I wanna make up for all the time we were apart.
I'm so happy.
I should be back around 6. When you go out, leave the key in the mailbox. Shoji
Damn! I wanted to be sure to get up early
and make breakfast for him.
I'll make up for it before Shoji gets back.
Doing stuff like this makes me feel like a newlywed wife.
Just to imagine how happy I'd be to help him out like this every day...
I wonder if it would be all right if I just stayed here.
Shoji would surely appreciate it.
Hi! How was your day?!
Uh... hi.
This is pretty tasty.
What's with that surprised look?
Because you come across as the type who doesn't do much cooking.
Th-That's not true.
Just joking. But this is really good.
I'm impressed.
This was worth the three hours it took me to make it.
By the way, how did it go with the real estate agent?
Did you find a place?
I didn't have time today, so I couldn't go.
Why? Oh, of course.
You were looking for a job. Did you find something?
That's right. I've gotta look for a job.
Don't tell me you were sleeping the whole time.
No way! I cleaned the house, did laundry and stuff,
it was a super productive day!
You serious?
You didn't come all the way to Tokyo to do that, did you?
You promised me you'd find a job that would allow you
to make it on your own, and give it every effort, right?
How can you say such a thing?!
I did this all for you, Shoji!
I shouldn't have talked to him like that.
It's like I'm trying to make him feel guilty.
Thanks for the meal.
I'll clean up.
It's all right.
I can take care of myself.
I'm pathetic.
I'm gonna take a bath.
I'll never make it like this. He's just gonna hate me.
What am I to do?
What can I do to keep him liking me?
Hey Nana.
Wanna take a bath together?
Not a chance!
Oh, give me a break.
What are you playing Miss Innocent for, at this point?
Well, it's embarrassing!
What's embarrassing?
I mean like...
Well, being an old couple, you and Kyosuke may have long forgotten
the embarrassments in a relationship.
An old couple?
The bathroom's brightly lit and it's small.
He'll be seeing every inch of me.
There's no way!
Keep your voice down.
Maybe living with my boyfriend isn't for me.
You know, I started going out with Shoji and
then right away we became long-distance lovers.
So there's still a bit of uneasiness and nervousness when we're alone.
What are you talking about?
When you were hanging around as friends back home,
there was nothing to be nervous about.
Being friends and being lovers is different!
I don't want to show my boyfriend my bad side!
I think it's a bit late for that.
By the way, I gotta go to the real estate agent by the station.
Could you join me?
Out of the question. I have to work this afternoon.
Come on. I won't know what to do by myself, Jun-chan.
Get a hold of yourself!
You are going to start living alone.
You have got to learn to do things on your own!
She's right. I don't think I can live with Shoji,
but living alone might be even harder.
Ando Real Estate
You won't find a nice place for fifty thousand yen a month or less.
If I work hard,
I might be able to afford a bit more for the rent,
but can't I get a better deal on the deposit?
Hmm... if you don't mind living in an older building.
No deposit!
And it's very reasonable for this space! I can have pets, too?
Do you wanna go and see it?
Yes!
It's not often you find a good deal like this!
There it is. That old brick building.
That mansion, built long before I was even born,
had such a high-class feel to it.
I fell in love with the elegant western design the moment I saw it.
The only problem was that the seven-story building had no elevator.
Being a country girl,
the riverside location and green environment was an added bonus.
So what do you think? Do you like it?
The view from the window is great, isn't it?
It's not often you find a good deal like this.
You know, you are a very lucky girl.
Hey, Nana.
Do you remember how we used to stand side-by-side by the river,
gazing at the lights that colored the water?
That song you were singing. Sing it for me again.
I reached into the sky
But I couldn't reach what I wanted
They grew smaller and disappeared into the sky
Like colorful balloons
I'm alone
My hand had no place to go
And gently you took it
Starless night
I won't look back at the shadow of my past
I want to feel your warmth
Tears are falling down
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go
Of your hand holding mine
