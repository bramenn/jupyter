If Inari keeps using that divine power, then...
my divinitymy very godliness itselfwill move into her.
Miss Inari!
Please hurry! It's Lady Uka!
Lady Uka is fadin' away?
What do you mean?
Her divine being grows fainter every time you use that power.
Great Amaterasu has said the same about using such power in that way.
But why would Lady Uka keep somethin' so important from me?
Miss Inari! This way!
Let's go, Miss Inari!
Has something happened to Uka?
Humans can't handle godly powers.
I know you knew that much, Uka!
This is all because I gave you my divine power.
You've been the one protectin' me all this time.
Why do you hold mortal ties in such high regard?
I just wanted you to be a normal girl.
Lady Uka, I... I...
Do you really think Inari can respond to those feelings of yours?
But I also wanted to stay friends with you, so I...
Now I'll protect you!
I'm sorry, Inari.
Lady Uka, you can have your divine power back.
Uka...
I'll rescue you. You can count on it!
All we can do from here is watch.
You know that as well as I do.
Why am I here

I'm about to fulfill my final duty!
Thanks. I'm countin' on you, Kon.

That was crazy!
Didn't see that coming!
Class A, roll call! Gather'round!
Here we go.
I've got this. My Inari impression is second to none.
Really?
Let's do a dry run. Fushimi!
Heeere!
That's nothin' like her.
Then you try!
Here.
Tanbabashi!
That's even worse! Sumizome?
Here!
Hey, that could work!
Tanbabashi!
You think? I'll give it a shot!
Here!
So you're just gonna up and disappear?
Not on my watch, you won't!
I'm so afraid.
Please... Inari...
Lady Uka!
Miss Inari!
Miya! Lady Uka's...
Keep your wits about you, Miss Inari!
You're the only one who can save her!
I'm done for! I simply can't go on!
You've done well. Thank you.
But will Miss Inari be all right on her own?
I believe in her.
Huh?

Miss Inari?

Lady Uka...
Miss Inari!
Miss Inari?
Why?
Why didn't you tell me?
Not even somethin' as serious as you fadin' away?
I thought we were friends.
What was I trying to accomplish?
I, a god, wanted to be friends with Inari.
So I gave her my divine power,
but all it brought her was suffering.
It won't open.
I was so afraid of losing her, but now it's all going to end in tears.
It's all my fault. All of it.
And this is my punishment.
But this is my fault!
Kon!

Inari, my gift of divine power...
Open!
Open up!
Open!
It's caused you so much pain.
Open!
It opened!
Lady Uka!
Inari... How did you...
Ah! My beloved Uka!
I'll be right there, Lady Uka!
But you're hurt, Inari!
Just a few scratches.
I'm so sorry, Inari.
I can't protect you anymore.
Even though I said I would.
I'm fading away.
Forgive me, Inari.
What are you talkin' about?!
I'm not about to give up!
I'm not givin' up, period!
Heave ho!

Even Ootoshi's out there, givin' it his all.
Hmph. You'll spoil those kids of yours.
Heave ho!
Heave ho!
Heave ho!
We did it! Lady Uka!
What the?!
My top half fit just fine!
My goodness. How can you be so fat on the bottom and yet so flat on the top?
Oof! Push!
Oof!
No, Master Toshi, not you!
What? Why?
Oof!
Remember, we're doing this for your sister!
Push! Oof!
This is no time to be putting the moves on her best friend!
You're not so different, you know.
Hmph.
Inari!
Lady Uka!
Inari! Are you all right?
Y-Yeah...
Lady Uka!
Kon! You're here, too?
Lady Uka...
You were a big help to Inari. Thank you.
Lady Uka!
Lady Uka.
Inari.
Miss Inari...
Why? Why didn't you tell me you were fadin' away?
That's pretty important!
Why would you tell Touka and not me?
I didn't want you to worry.
But you said...
You said we were friends!
And you didn't tell me anything.
I was the only one who didn't know.
That sucks.
You didn't tell me about the divine power surging out of you.
Well, that, uh...
I didn't want you to worry.
I guess we're even.
Uh, Lady Uka?
I've grown closer to Tanbabashi,
and now I can tell my friends what's on my mind.
And it's all thanks to you and your divine power.
That's not so, Inari.
Divine power cannot move a person's heart.
That was all your doing, Inari.
I'll give you back your divine power, Lady Uka.
Inari, konkon!
Divine power, return to Lady Uka!
My power was nothing but trouble for you, Inari.
Actually, it was so wonderful I wanted to tell the whole world about it!
I'll still be watching over you, just like always.
Thank you, Inari.
Thank you, Lady Uka!

Were you
Where'd you run off to?
What kind of trouble was your friend in?
Is she okay?
You're all scraped up! Hang on.
For cryin' out loud, Inari!
You're way out of it!
Did you hit your head or something?
Let's get those disinfected. Give me your hand.
Fushimi!
Um... What happened?
Are you all right?
He's been worried sick about you.
Foolin' the teachers was easier than dealin' with him.
Huh?
Inari?
Fushimi?
Fushimi?
I'm okay.
I'm...
I'm okay.
Lady Uka!
Lady Uka?
Thank youall of you.
Uka!
Oh, thank goodness! You're okay!
Yes, thank you.
Take it down a notch, would you?
Uka!
That's it! I'm through!
Thank goodness!
So Miss Inari made it in time!
Indeed. Thank you, Miya.
Well? Do you get it now?
Pardon?
I'm asking if you understand why gods and humans don't mix!
Great Amaterasu, we gods may indeed be incompatible with humans.
But they're quite interesting in their impermanence.
I feel there's much to learn from them.
I sighed involuntarily
I sighed involuntarily
and that little bit of sadness
and that little bit of sadness
flew with the birds to vanish in the distance

In particular, I found love to be of special interest.
We committed our share of faux-pas, then shook hands

but now I understand

Just stop by the Celestial Plains once in a while, eh?

One day I'll tell you of my feelings

I didn't want you to know of my wishes,

For everyone to share.
so I lowered my voice

and whispered to the gods
and whispered to the gods
Inari!
Hurry up, or you'll be late!
Every day I feel the love inside my heart and hope I won't faint

The wind turns my cheeks red

Even if I can't see you, I know you're there.
