In order to protect something, you need power
and to obtain something requires even greater power.
If you have no power, giving it up is the only option.
And to recover what you've lost...
Yo, so you're Irene Urzaiz, huh?
See what you can do with that.
You pass.
Fine, tell me what it is you want.
Sister...
Sister?
Sister?
Priscilla?
It's almost time.
All right, then!
How about we get this task out of the way?
S-Sister...
There's nothing to worry about.
Just handle everything like you always do.
You can leave the fighting to me.
Well, not like we won't have to come out guns blazing...
or things could get dire!
Sorry to keep doing this to you.
Oh, no! It's totally no big deal! But...
I'm sorry.
You dummy.
Why are you apologizing?
Yeah.
The Gravi-Sheath
All right, it's almost time, huh?
Oh, right. I guess it is.
What's the matter?
We can't have you pondering things before a match.
The thing is... there's something I'd like to try out.
Ayato.
Yeah?
I've got to win this match.
No matter who our opponent is, I have no intention of giving up on my wish.
That's why I'm here right now.
Right.
But... Neither do I care how we win.
If we can win doing it your way, go right ahead.
We're partners.
We work together, and fight hand in hand.
Isn't that only natural?
Julis...
Thanks.
Idiot. No thanks necessary.
Remember, we're up against that Gravi-Sheath!
I know it's not gonna be easy. But...
Fine. Go ahead and do it.
But we're probably only going to get one chance.
Then it'll be out of our hands.
All right... Then let's get going!
Right!
All right! It's been one exciting match after another throughout Round 4!
And the grand finale in Sirius Dome will feature Seidoukan Academy's Amagiri/Riessfeld team
vs. the Urzaiz Sisters of Le Wolfe Black Academy!
Now this is another must-see!
With the sword inside me, I shall break out of this starry prison...
and release my savage force!
There it is, there it is!
Amagiri's performance, which is now a well-known sight!
Always a flair for the dramatic, eh?
I see you're bursting with motivation, Amagiri.
In that case...
I think I'll go all-out myself!
Phoenix Festa Fourth round, Match 11!
Let the battle begin!
Burst into bloom - Livingstone Daisy!
Go!
How cunning!
Whoa!
She stopped it!
The Ser=Veresta is known to burn any object with a fiery slash,
but against a comparable Ogre Luxe, it's a different story!
Damn!
So the odds are stacked against me in a swordfight, huh?
Tenfold Destruction!
For a team cobbled together in a couple of months, not bad!
Right back at you!
I'm impressed that you can evade so well on your own.
Oh, but I'm not alone.
We're a team of two, as well.
This power is mine and Priscilla's...
The power we share!
Get out of the way, Ayato!
As expected, you react well.
Julis!
I know!
Longiflorum!
Heavy Reed Prison!
Setting-type defensive powers!
This is a secret weapon that I've devised for Priscilla.
It won't be easily destroyed.
So we're back to square one, huh?
Ayato...
My preparations are complete.
If you're going to try out that thing, do it fast.
Roger that.
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.
All right, let's move on to Round Two!
Do you really think that's the right way to do this?
Shut up, Amagiri.
I don't need to hear that from you now.
Then...
I said shut up!
You sneaky little...
Burst into bloom...
Primrose!
Damn, you piss me off!
Hundredfold Funeral Procession!
Amagiri Shinmei Style First Sword, Twin Dragons!
Damn!
I see.
Who would've thought you'd go for the Gravi-Sheath?
That was close, but we're out of time, Ayato.
I know.
All right... Now it's my turn for payback!
Ten Thousandfold Destruction!
Hate to break it to you, but I'm not much of a control artist.
Yeah, but still, I can't miss with these!
Julis! Focus on defense!
Right, I know!
Break down and vanish!
Amagiri Shinmei Style, Intermediate Skill...
Repulsing Crow!
You gotta be kidding me...
Julis!
Leave it to me!
Come out - Gloriosa!
I can see right through that trap!
That's just a decoy!
What the hell?!
This is the ultimate fire skill in my arsenal of setting-type powers.
I hope you enjoy it!
Damn!
Come out, Rafflesia!
Sister!
No way...
Don't tell me you held off the blast with the Gravi-Sheath's power?
Thank goodness! Sister!
Sister?
Sister?
Not good!
Wh-What is this?
What on earth is going on here?
Most likely... that's not Irene.
It's the Gravi-Sheath!
What did you say?
Anyway, we've got to do something or Priscilla will be in danger!
Ayato!
Irene!
Open your eyes, Irene!
Don't confuse power with what's precious to you!
Irene! If it's really precious to you, grab it with both hands!
So which is it that you want right now?!
Irene...
Can you believe those shockwaves?
This match isn't over yet!
Well, their school badges haven't pronounced them unconscious yet!
Is this...
Didn't you say that you hated being tested?
Amagiri Shinmei Style, Intermediate Skill...
Reverse-gouging Shell!
Game over!
Round 4, Block C...
And the winners of this furious battle are...
Ayato Amagiri and Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld!
Ayato!
Well, I guess that's as much as I could expect.
Oh, my! Amagiri suddenly looks like he's in trouble!
Does this mean that he's sustained significant damage?
Hmm, I guess...
No, but this Manadite is clearly...
What? Huh?
Wh-What on earth was that?
So Ayato Amagiri can only maintain that power for a specified length of time.
Did I jump the gun, getting the Cats ready?
No, probably not.
It's that woman's kid brother. Who knows what could happen?
If there's a red flag, it would be those Jie Long brats,
but it depends on how much they'll butt in.
Not to mention, I'll have to settle the score with that Arlequint girl.
Damn, what a pain in the ass!
Looks like Amagiri's Prana levels have nosedived.
You never know, that thing he does might not be a performance...
What a pleasure this young boy is.
Truly intriguing.
How will it end up with those guys?
It will be a sight to see!
I thought he was someone to watch out for.
But it looks like he's done after this point.
I wouldn't be so sure.
What?
I think there's another twist in store.
So that young swordsman's got a limiter, too.
Looks like he can only release his power for about five minutes, tops.
Well... it would be child's play for AR-D and RM-C to hold him off for five minutes.
No problem at all.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh, but... But...
I bet we'll be in for an even bigger spectacle!
Oh, boy, I can't wait!
The battle can't start soon enough!
Wow! Amazing!
Ayato Amagiri, eh?
Miss Sylvia! Please get ready to stand by!
All right!
Are you in any pain?
No.
Um, why am I here?
You ran out of Prana.
Seems like I drained too much of your blood.
My bad!
No, no.
So how did the match end?
We lost.
I see.
Then what about the Gravi-Sheath?
It broke.
That bastard Amagiri pulverized it like a madman.
I see... Amagiri did that?
Oh, but won't you get yelled at by the student council chairman?
Nah. Can you believe it? No reprimand whatsoever.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, since I didn't fulfill my mission, I can't pay down my debt.
After all that, no pay? Jeez...
Well, maybe I panicked a little... guess it can't be helped, right?
Listen, Sister...
I always thought the most important thing was for you to do whatever you wanted.
Because you've always treasured me more than anyone else.
But I want to become strong.
If you're going to fight, Sister, then I want to fight with you.
I don't just want to be protected by you, I want to stand by your side.
Priscilla...
You can't stop me, okay?
And someday...
I swear I'm going to become even more powerful than you!
Is that right?
That's something to look forward to!
Well, your cover's been blown in spectacular fashion.
And thanks to the toll of breaking your seal,
you won't even be able to move that well tomorrow.
Oh well, I'll figure something out.
Ouch ouch ouch!
Just look at you! You're one to talk!
How can you be so optimistic?!
It's not like I'm feeling optimistic.
I know this is serious.
But... I can't break my promise.
Promise?
I told you I'd have your back, Julis. Don't you remember?
I-Idiot!
What kind of thing is that to just blurt out?
But...
At this rate, I'm just going to be doing the same thing over and over, so...
H-Hey...
It's about time...
I faced up to this seal, once and for all, you know?
Ayato, don't try to fight alone.
We're partners.
If you're going to have my back,
then I'm going to have your back, as well.
Thanks, Julis.
Ayato!
Ayato-senpai!
Are you all right, Ayato?
Yeah... I'm... all... right!
Ayato-senpai!
You don't really look all right.
Normally, I'd want you to take a good, long rest, but...
In that case, I'm going to take care of you so you'll recover faster.
I-I'll take care of you, too!
And I'll make you rice balls, too!
K-Kirin!
Hey! Just worry about your own match, you two!
In that case,
I should be the one to nurse Ayato, as I have no matches.
Needless to say, if you wish, Ayato, I'll stay the whole night.
H-Hey, hold up!
C-Calm down, will you, you guys?
- Ayato! - Ayato-senpai!
You all have this scary look in your eyes, guys.
Jeez! Enough is enough, you three!
Can't you see Ayato can't get any rest?!
Seriously...
Now, then...
I wonder how is this gonna end?
At last, it's time...
Haruka...
Thanks to you, I'm way behind in my plan.
But now...
