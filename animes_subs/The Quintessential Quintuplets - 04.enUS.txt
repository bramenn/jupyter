It's a pleasant Sunday.
I hope you're having a good time.
There's going to be a fireworks festival in Higashi-cho today.
I get the whole day off today.
I'm going to forget about the quintuplets and study all I want!
I should teach them this formula.
This is a good problem. Even Yotsuba could learn from it.
This one would be good for Miku.
Wait, what the hell am I doing?!
What am I, a tryhard tutor?!
Is it a loan shark?
If you're here for money, we don't have...
any.
Why'd you close the door on me?
Open up!
What?
There's something I need to give you.
My father left your pay with me.
You're turning Yukichi-san wrinkly with your sweat!
Five thousand yen a day for each of us.
That's fifty thousand yen for two days.
Mom, Onii-chan made it.
Holy cow. We'll be able to pay off the loans in no time.
Well, I'll be leaving now.
I can't accept this.
Sure, I did go to your place twice.
But I didn't do anything.
Are you sure?
What about the sexual harassment?
Onii-chan!
I thought we cleared that up!
I don't think it's true that you've done nothing.
Your presence is beginning to change something in the five of us.
The five of you?
I made a mistake.
The four of them.
A-Anyway, I won't take this back.
Use it however you like.
Raiha, is there anything you want?
Onii-chan!
The coins!
Way to go!
So why are you here?
What choice did I have?
I want to try going to the arcade!
You'll come too, won't you, Itsuki-san?
Please?
You should have said no.
How could I? She's too cute.
I hear ya!
Bring it on!
Here I go.
Over here!
Hey!
Raiha-chan's enjoying herself.
Raiha has a hard time because of our family situation.
I'm sure there are many more things she'd like to do.
I want to grant all of her wishes.
Onii-chan! Itsuki-san!
I want to do that one with the two of you before we go.
A-Actually, that one looks more...
All of her wishes, right?
On second thought, I'm going to pass.
You aren't getting away.
You scoot in too, Itsuki-san.
O-Okay.
It's like a family photo.
Itsuki-san
Raiha
Onii-chan
What kind of face is that?
You're one to talk.
Onii-chan, Itsuki-san, thank you.
I'll cherish this for the rest of my life.
And there goes my Sunday.
No, I still have the evening.
All of you had better study tonight, too.
I should get going.
Something's fishy.
You have homework.
Have you finished it?
Stop following me!
Onii-chan, I see four Itsuki-sans.
Oh, Uesugi-san?
Why are you with him, Itsuki?!
Were you in the middle of a date?
Sorry.
We aren't!
Are you Uesugi-san's kid sister?
Yes.
Let's go see the fireworks together.
Fireworks?
Hang on a second.
I have plans to study.
You all have homework, too.
Onii-chan...
Please?
Sure, we can go.
But only...
after...
all of you...
finish...
your homework!
Jeez!
We're gonna miss the start of the fireworks!
Yakisoba
Okonomiyaki
Shaved Ice
Finally done!
Good work, everyone.
When are the fireworks starting again?
They're from 7 PM to 8 PM.
I'm going to check out the stalls!
Why are they so excited?
Want to try catching goldfish?
Yeah!
I'm in!
Well, at least they did their homework for once.
Is that how badly they want to see the fireworks?
What's with that unfestive look on your face?
S-Stop staring at me.
Who are you?
You girls are hard enough to tell apart as it is.
Don't go changing your hairstyle.
It's me, Itsuki.
And I'm free to do my hair however I please!
That won't do.
When a girl changes her hairstyle,
you have to compliment her.
Hey, don't you want to find out if girls truly wear nothing under their yukatas?
That was a long time ago.
I already know.
Are you sure about that?
Ichika!
I'm just playing!
Ugh.
Well? Did I get your heart racing a bit?
What are you all doing here?
Let's go, Ichika.
Sorry, I got a call.
Yes.
What? Tonight?
And you know...
It was supposed to be just the five of us here for the fireworks.
Why are you here?
I'm just here with my sister.
Onii-chan.
Look, look.
Yotsuba-san caught all these for me.
Couldn't you have held back a little?
Seeing Raiha-chan, I couldn't help but want to get her a gift.
She bought me this, too.
Super Fireworks Set
That's the last thing we need today!
I just couldn't wait.
Did you say thank you to Yotsuba?
Thank you, Yotsuba-san.
I love you.
Hnnngh
You're so cute, Raiha-chan!
I want to make you my sister!
Wait a second.
If I married Uesugi-san, we'd legally be sisters.
Do you realize what you're saying?
And you better not get any weird ideas about Yotsuba!
I have none!
Sorry!
I-It's fine.
Thanks for waiting.
Okay, let's go.
Are you going somewhere?
Nino rented out a shop's rooftop.
Rented out? What are you, the bourgeoisie?!
Hang on a second.
We've come out to a festival,
and we aren't going to buy the thing?
Yakitori
Takoyaki
Okonomiyaki
She's right. We haven't bought the thing.
Are you talking about the thing?
Was there a food stand selling the thing?
I can't wait to have the thing!
What's the thing?
Ready, and...
Candy apples!
Chocolate bananas!
Yakisoba!
Ningyouyaki!
Shaved ice!
Let's go buy it all!
I'm starting to wonder if you're really quintuplets.
Raiha, stay close, or you'll get lost.
Hold on here.
Okay.
That shop owner... I don't like him.
I'll give ya some freebies, pretty lady.
What was that about?!
We're identical!
Being quints is complicated.
Raiha-chan.
Want to go play ring toss?
I do!
Don't get lost.
Yakisoba, yakisoba!
Hurry up, guys!
Nino's pumped.
Takoyaki
You all seem pretty excited, too.
Why? Fireworks shows happen every year.
Fireworks were a big part of memories we shared with our mom.
She loved the fireworks, so we all went together every year.
Every year, even after Mom went away.
For us, fireworks are special.
I see.
No wonder she's so gung-ho.
Thank you all for waiting.
The fireworks are about to begin.
Guys...
The fireworks are starting.
Hurry.
Wait, where'd everyone go?
Ow.
Who stepped on my foot?
Yotsuba!
Ichika!
Itsuki!
Miku!
Grab on.
Wh-What?
We'll never get anywhere standing here.
Take me to the shop you rented out.
Just so you know, you're not invited.
I know, I know. Let's go.
Aren't the five of you going to watch the fireworks together?
Here?
Yeah.
On the roof of this building.
Everyone must be here already.
Oh, shoot.
Come to think of it, I'm the only one who knows where the shop is.
Fireworks Show Ends In
There's a theory that Tokugawa Ieyasu was the first to see fireworks in Japan.
Fireworks were invented in China, but they went through Europe
and arrived in Japan's Tanegashima along with firearms.
This is utterly boring.
What did I do to deserve having to watch the fireworks with you?
It's your fault!
I can't get a hold of them on their phones, either.
I worked so hard to finish my homework, too.
Why is this happening?
Yotsuba
Incoming call
Yotsuba?
Where are you?
The clock tower?
Yeah. Got it.
I'll come get you. Stay there.
Jeez!
Your sister's fine.
She's with Yotsuba.
Okay.
Don't just stand there. Call them!
Right.
Uesugi Raiha
Dad
Nope! This phone's useless!
You're useless!
Huh?
Isn't that Ichika?
You're right.
Why? The network's acting up again.
Fireworks were a big part of memories we shared with our mom.
Wait here.
I'll go get everyone.
I don't want to be alone with you anyway.
Neither do I.
Never mind.
Go get them for me.
Ichika!
Good.
Nino's waiting.
Let's go back to the shop.
Who are you?
Who are you?
What's your relationship with Ichika-chan?
Relationship?
I'm her...
Uh...
Friend?
Teacher?
Associate?
Acquaintance?
Right.
I'm her acquaintance.
I'm her acquaintance!
What are you doing, Ichika?
Futaro.
Ichi
Miku.
Thank goodness.
I'm surprised you managed to find me.
Well, you were sticking out like a sore thumb.
Oh, right.
I have to go after Ichika.
Come with me.
Wait.
Ow...
Someone stepped on my foot.
You go ahead, Futaro.
Hop on my back.
Miku, can you see Ichika from up there?
Ichika?
I can't.
You aren't actually going to chase after her like this, are you?
You're heavy, so I can't chase after her.
Does that help?
Thanks.
Huh? Is she angry?
Want me to buy you some takoyaki, Raiha-chan?
Oh, there's yakisoba over there.
And okonomiyaki that way!
Yotsuba-san, we have to stay here.
Here.
This'll keep you going.
I owe you.
So, did you really see Ichika?
Yeah.
She definitely noticed me,
but she took off with some dude with a mustache.
Any idea who it might have been?
No.
I think I've seen her getting out of some mustachioed man's car.
Say what?
I hope there's nothing sketchy going on between them.
Well, not that I care.
Forty minutes left.
What is she up to?
The fireworks are going to be over before you five get together.
You're being helpful, even though this has nothing to do with studying.
I wouldn't expect that from you.
That's rude.
I'm invested in this now.
Besides, I watched you all desperately do your homework for this.
Can you walk?
Yeah.
Pardon us.
We're surveying people who came to see the the fireworks today.
What is the relationship between the two of you?
What's your relationship with Ichika-chan?
Oh, I guess there was no need to ask.
The two of them are a couple.
Right.
W-We aren't in a relationship.
But that's clearly what it looks like.
Th-This is...
It's not like that.
The two of us are friends.
We're just acquaintances.
Or should I just say schoolmates?
I guess that isn't quite enough.
I-I see.
Close acquaintances?
A client?
Pardon us.
Futaro.
Huh?
Wh-What?
Nothing.
Never mind.
Futaro.
Look.
Wait here.
I'll go get her.
Itsuki!
Oh, it's you.
Couldn't you hide your disappointment a little?
Miku's resting over there.
Let's meet up with her.
Sure.
Now we're just missing Ichika.
Can I ask you something?
What's our relationship?
What's with that creepy question?
Let's see...
At the very most,
we're complete strangers.
At the very most?!
Besides, you don't need to ask me.
You already have the answer to that question.
Never mind that. We need to find Ichika.
Where has she gone?
Thank goodness.
You found Itsuki-chan.
Ichi
Over here.
Did you see the fireworks? Aren't they awesome?
Hey, where are we going? Aren't you going to watch with the others?
Just come with me.
Uesugi-kun?!
Anyway, don't tell anyone about what happened earlier.
I can't watch the fireworks with the rest of you.

Next Time on The Quintessential Quintuplets
05 Five Fifths
Quintuplet Trivia!
I shall be announcing the sum of the quintuplets' breast sizes.
What's wrong with this robot?
Eighty-eight times five makes 444 centimeters, right?
Four hundred forty-one centimeters.
Four hundred forty- one centimeters?
Okay, that's enough of that!
