Dream of life
From: Azuki Miho Sub: Mashiro I read Hirameki! Tanto-kun. It'll definitely be a big hit with the kids!
Kaya is still 19.
I know. Sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
You're always saying, No one will ever take an abrasive woman like you as a bride.
If a guy like that exists, I'd like to meet him.
You should be glad! This is him!
Just look at him! He's pretty handsome, right?
Sorry.
He wants to be a manga author, huh?
Sorry.
He already is one! He's been serialized before!
And he's got a new one starting in February.
Your friend was a manga author, wasn't he?
Don't bring that up now.
He literally put his life on the line to draw manga, and ended up dying because of it.
He died?
Was that friend of yours Kawaguchi Tarou, by any chance?
That's right.
Mashiro Nobuhiro.
Pen name: Kawaguchi Tarou.
He was my best friend.
Shujin's probably being told something like
I won't hand my daughter over to a manga author with such an unstable future by now.
I see. So you're working with his nephew.
Y-Yes.
It's like fate, isn't it?
Can you call this Mashiro Moritaka here?
Why?
If they're a team, then I want to test the team's determination, not just Akito's.
Test their determination?
Shujin!
Did it not work out after all?
Hello?
Saiko!
Team up with me for a karate match against Miyoshi's dad!
Huh?! What are you on about?!
He wants to test our determination as a team!
Please!
But I have nothing to do with this!
But you do!
Apparently, Miyoshi's dad and Kawaguchi Tarou were old friends!
Once that came to light, it seemed like things were looking up,
but then he said he wanted to test our determination.
Okay. I'll be right there.
There he is. Mashiro!
Sorry to call you here while you were working.
Sorry, Saiko.
Nice to meet you. I'm Mashiro Moritaka.
You've grown.
I saw you briefly at the funeral.
Well, let's get to the dojo.
I-I'll try my best.
R-Right.
Hang in there, Akito...
Please take your time.
Um...
That karate match thing was just an excuse to get you two away.
Huh?
Some things are difficult to say in front of my wife and daughter.
Mashiro Nobuhiro.
Nobu was my best friend... and my rival in love.
Rival in love?
Was it Haruno Miyuki?
How do you know about her?
Some letters from her were left in my uncle's office.
We got a general idea from those.
I see. The letters, huh?
Hey, Nobu, why'd you bring me out here?
You gonna confess your love to me, or something?
Yosshi...
What, seriously?
I'll say this only to you.
Wait! Don't be too hasty!
I don't swing that way
I just got a letter from Haruno.
What?!
But this isn't a love letter.
It just says, Let's do our best in high school.
She's just shy!
A girl as shy as her sending you a letter is pretty much the confession of a lifetime!
R-Really?
Definitely!
I'm super jealous,
but I'll be fine, since it's you.
Then can I write a reply?
Yeah, go for it!
I know the rest from reading the letters.
In the end, they never told each other their feelings, and Miyuki married someone else.
He was an idiot. If he had just told her back then, who knows how things could've turned out?
Um...
What is it?
Miyuki's daughter went to our middle school,
and she's dating Mashiro right now!
And this girl... well, her name's Azuki Miho.
She's Kaya's best friend.
Miho?
I hear Kaya talking about her sometimes, but I didn't...
About that!
Her dream's been to become a voice actress ever since middle school.
Will Akito be okay?
If he gets a fracture, he won't be able to write manga anymore.
You don't need to worry.
But...
The karate thing was just an excuse.
Succeed as a manga artist, then get married, huh?
You've done enough, haven't you?!
Why won't you tell her your feelings?!
I was just a bit lucky with my current serialization!
Until I succeed as a manga author and can make a living...
Do you have to do all this just to tell her how you feel?
Yeah! Because I want to marry her!
If I date her, then it'll be with the intention of marriage.
I can't believe the nephew would take after his uncle so much.
I can't help but cheer you on, too.
Cheer me on...
Then...
Yeah. After seeing Nobu, I think it's best to be with the person you love as soon as possible.
If people make an honest effort, it'll work out.
You seem like an honest guy.
Thank you!
You too.
Make your dream come true for Nobu's sake as well!
Yes!
I'll work hard for it!
I'm so glad her parents were nice people.
I enjoyed learning more about my uncle.
It's from Azuki.
Instead of replying to me, she calls you?
Congratulations, Takagi!
Thanks!
I'll do my best so that you and Saiko can get married soon too!
Make sure to always get along with Kaya and Mashiro!
And with you, too.
Yeah, thanks!
I have to call Kaya.
I'm really happy for you two!
All right! Let's go for it!
Let's make Tanto a big hit!
Yeah!
Because your lifestyle depends on it!
Don't say that!
The pressure will kill me!
My bad!
Please take this ticket.
Th-Thanks.
Oh, you're here.
Miura.
Sorry, but I'm still getting things ready.
Go on without me.
Okay.
Um...
Ashirogi!
Fukuda!
Aoki, too!
Good evening.
I came, too.
Of course.
There's no way you'd miss the New Year's party, Hiramaru.
True that.
Hattori!
Oh, congrats on your new serializaton!
Well, enjoy the party.
O-Okay...
I'm Ibaraki, editor-in-chief of Jack SQ.
We're aware of +NATURAL's reputation.
By the way, if there are any other stories you'd like to write, by all means
Akina!
Hattori!
I read your fax.
Chapter seven was well done.
Thank you.
Do you have any questions or concerns?
If you do, I'll quickly
No.
None at all. It was fantastic.
Enjoy yourself today.
Oh, the seventh chapter was good, too?
Yeah.
I'm so excited to read what happens next!
Hattori, I want to read the seventh chapter right away.
Sure. You can after this.
I'm looking forward to it!
I don't know much about it, but there's some pretty good hype for Natural.
Really?
But don't you think they're being kind of cold?
But I was really surprised!
You've shown some real talent by taking Akina Aiko's manuscript this far!
That's true, but
you're something else, too.
You thought of having Niizuma draw another manga.
Yes, I'm happy to have a popular author in Jack draw it for me.
Indeed, Hattori is the rising star of the editorial department.
Oh, please.
Yes! Hattori is a rising star!
A rising star?
Niizuma, will you really be okay with five assistants?
No problem!
I'll be Jack' s number one author this year, too!
It seems like the editorial department's expecting a lot more from Natural than Tanto!
Let's turn them around. I definitely don't want to lose to Iwase.
Yeah.
This time we'll overtake Eiji!
Thank you for coming today.
Arai, what are you doing after this?
There are things we can't talk about while the editors are around.
Then let's go somewhere else.
Fukuda!
What are you talking about with Aoki?
That's unfair!
Let's all go to the afterparty!
But Ashirogi and Master Niizuma are still underage.
Akina, too.
Then we can just go to a family restaurant!
I'll get Niizuma.
Niizuma, let's go to a
I need to get back to work, so I'm going home.
Work?
I'm going to make a storyboard for the seventh chapter.
You've already done up through the third chapter,
so there's no need to rush.
Right, right!
Forget about work for today!
No, I won't!
I'm having fun drawing manga right now!
I could barely pull myself away from drawing to come here today!
Okay, I'll go grab it from the editorial department.
Then, SEE YOU AGAIN!
Hmph, party-pooper.
Then how about the rest of us go
Huh?
What?
All right. They've all gone home.
Hiramaru, what are you doing there all alone?
Mr. Yoshida...
Akira, you were too obvious.
What do you mean?
Giving Ashirogi that much incentive...
Why are you backing them so much?
Niizuma, it isn't good practice to support authors one isn't in charge of.
If it looked like that to you, please don't tell anyone else.
I know.
That's why I'm bringing it up now.
In the future, Ashirogi will become one of the pillars of Jack.
That's what I believe.
Just like you are.
I think so too, and I want it to happen soon.
So no matter how you support them, I'll help you!
However...
I won't lose to them!
Nice to meet you! I'm Orihara Ichiriki!
Looking forward to working together!
Orihara got honorable mention for the Tezuka Prize.
I've got Takahama too, so you guys should be all set.
I'm the artist, Mashiro.
I'm the writer, Takagi.
And I'm his wife, Takagi Kaya!
Nice to meet you!
H-Huh? Wife?
They registered at the end of last year.
You're a freshman in college with a serialization and a wife?!
Awesome! Too awesome!
There really are a ton of strange manga authors!
I'll do my best too!
The two of us will live here from now on.
I'm so happy!
Your dad's giving us the realtor hookup, huh?
Let's be happy.
Hm?
No, I'll make us happy.
Okay!
All right! The first chapter's done!
Good work, everybody.
I brought the publishing sample of +NATURAL.
An opening color page? And CROW's got one in the middle?
It's already a Niiuzma Eiji issue.
Well, he's drawing both of them.
They don't want people to overlook either of them.
Anyway, let's check out Natural.
Yeah.
This is good!
It's not just good!
It's got an indie vibe.
But even though all the conventions of a first chapter are being broken, it still feels mainstream!
Indie? Mainstream? I don't get it.
It's not about defeating some enemy
and wrapping things up in one chapter,
but you can definitely tell it's a shounen manga.
Yeah.
He's following the pattern of stuff like Pokemon by hatching the egg into various monsters.
Oh, that I can understand.
That's super mainstream!
As for franchise opportunities, if it were turned into a card game, kids would probably love it.
And an anime, too.
Speaking of anime adaptations...
Otters 11 will be turned into a late-night anime!
No way!
Not even I could lie about that.
Mr. Yoshida!
I'm so glad I followed you!
I've been a terrible person for thinking of you
as a long-haired narcissistic con man who tricked me time and time again!
So that's what you think of me?
Well, not that you're wrong.
We'll announce it in the magazine this spring.
The anime starts in the fall.
You understand, don't you, Hiramaru?
Yes!
Until fall... No, for the rest of the year, I won't breathe a word about taking a break!
By the way,
why a late-night slot?
I can't tell him that no matter how long we wait, we'll never get an offer for an evening timeslot.
Right.
Well, you know, it has a pretty dark theme.
I see!
This should be good for a while.
I'm too much.
Otters and CROW got an anime.
Fukuda and Aoki's look promising, so if we don't pull out all the stops, we'll be left behind.
The first chapter of Tanto has already been sent to the press.
The storyboards up to chapter three have been finalized.
The rest is out of our hands.
Oh, have you come up with an idea for the invention that'll appear in the fourth chapter?
Not yet...
I was going to wait for the results of the first chapter and revise it based on that.
Still, you need to be brainstorming ideas one after another.
Otherwise, you can't move forward.
You're right.
I'll make a list by tomorrow.
That'll be 250 yen.
Thank you very much.
Do you need a bag?
Yes.
Okay then.
Here's your change: 10 yen.
Thank you. Please come again.
This is crazy!
This week's Jack is completely sold out in every convenience store and bookstore!
It's only 3 PM on a Monday!
Is it the Niizuma Eiji effect?!
No way. It has to be a coincidence!
No, you're exactly right.
Everyone was buzzing about it on the Internet yesterday before it went on sale.
They were saying that +NATURAL is going to be great!
My apologies.
All copies were sold out yesterday.
It's first place in the preliminary polls!
We did it!
And now for the final results...
It's first place by a long shot!
CROW's in fourth.
All that's changed since it ranked third last week is Natural being placed at the top.
It's perfect.
Natural is first place, after all?
I really don't want Tanto's first chapter to rank under Natural's second chapter.
I know how you feel, but plot-driven manga and gag manga are different.
Anything in the top three is a great success. Even top five is great.
That doesn't matter.
Natural was first place.
Tanto will be first, too!
Yeah!
We stopped by the convenience store, but...
Don't worry about that!
Last week was unusual!
By this time tomorrow...
No, by tonight, they'll all be gone!
It's Miura!
It must be the results!
You got fifth place!
Fifth...
Come on. What's with that reaction?
I told you before that getting fifth place with a gag manga is a good thing!
Oh, yeah...
What about Natural?
Third?
Yes... Yes...
CROW was fourth.
I read Hirameki! Tanto-kun.
It'll definitely be a big hit with the kids!
Kids... huh?
Hey, cheer up already.
You'll feel a lot better if you move around some!
Huh? Was there more stuff coming?
Coming!
Iwase!
Congratulations on your marriage.
How do you know where we live?
I called your parent's house.
I really just wanted to congratulate you.
Thanks!
See ya.
Wait a minute!
Just wanted to congratulate us?!
Until a little while ago, you were saying you were in love with my man!
I read that letter!
Stop it!
But I can't take her congratulations seriously!
I liked the Takagi with talent.
What the hell does that mean?!
Stop, I said!
Natural was more popular!
You have more talent than me!
Without a doubt!
That's what you wanted to hear, right, Iwase?
Yes.
Take this back.
Ever since middle school, Takagi Akito has only had eyes for me.
I don't need your congratulations.
You should hurry up and find some other guy with more talent than him.
I already have.
Really? Who is it?
You're just blowing hot air.
It's Hattori!
Your editor?!
He's your boyfriend?!
No...
But he's a man with great talent that I can admire.
He's the man I like.
Your sixth chapter came in 11th, as well.
Same as last week.
The first chapter was 5th, the second was 9th,
the third was 10th,
and ever since then, it's stayed at 11th place.
In a sense, it's stable.
Hey, guys, you should feel proud.
The lead editor even said it's been a long time since Jack had a manga that's well-received by the younger readers.
He did?
Yeah!
Kids usually pick their top three manga based on how funny they think it is, not the quality of the plot.
Gag manga have the advantage there.
I don't care about that!
We have to think about how we can do better!
Better, huh?
Hm... How to pull in more kids?
Will Tanto become a boom, or will Tanto start a boom?
A boom, a boom...
Starting a boom with a gag manga...
Some signature joke that will stick in kids' heads...
Oh, that's it!
It may be a bit old, but something like Iyami's Shii!
If you repeat the same joke over and over, it can become a meme!
I'll work at it.
If I have something repeatable, it might make writing jokes easier.
I see.
We can get better rankings if we change how we do things!
Good work.
The seventh chapter's still at 2nd place... Natural is really something.
Well, it's not as if CROW dropped in popularity. It actually got more votes.
Speaking of rankings, your favorite Ashirogi has settled at 11th place.
The editorial department is saying things like, Looks like Ashirogi can do gag manga too,
and Manga that bring in younger readers are valuable.
What do you think of Tanto?
I'm not reading it anymore!
What?!
Is it okay for us to continue Tanto like this?
Don't say something so unnerving right before my wedding ceremony!
Love and Denial.
In order to achieve your dream,
you need to stick to your goals!

The fight doesn't end until I fulfill my dream
I wonder how far I've come now?
In ten years, I'll be living the dream
It's the scenario I wrote for myself, so I'll have no regrets
But life isn't that easy, and it's full of obstacles
Still, I swear to myself that I won't ever back down
I have a dream that I absolutely want to achieve
So I fuel my passion until I succeed
There will be meetings and partings along the way
But I'll simply believe in my strength that you've taught me
And rise back up again and again and again

News New work by Niizuma Eiji a hot topic before it even goes on sale! Entertainment: In next week's Shounen Jack, on sale the 18th, +Natural will begin serialization. This is a new work by popular author Niizuma Eiji of CROW fame. The manuscript is done by amateur novel contest winner Akina Aiko. Niizuma Eiji's CROW is also currently in serialization, which means he will have an unprecedented two simultaneous serializations in Jack. From the moment it was announced in the magazine, it's been a hot topic on the Internet, and is causing waves.
