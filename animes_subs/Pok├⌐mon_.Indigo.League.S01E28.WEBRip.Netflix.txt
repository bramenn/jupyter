Wow, look at that.
It's a wild Hitmonchan.
So that's one of those fighting Pokemon I've heard about.
That one's a real fighter.
Hitmonchan, a skilled fighting Pokemon
that packs an incredibly fast punch.
All right, let's capture it.
-Ready, Pikachu? -Pikachu.
If you defeat Hitmonchan, you'll become the world champion Pokemon.
Pikachu.
Chan!
-Pika. -You don't have to be afraid.
I'll teach you my secret punch, and nobody'll be able to beat you.
Pikachu.
You got to learn the basics first.
Keep your left up and jab with your right.
Pika, pika.
Since when did Ash become a boxing expert?
Beats me.
Well, everything's been going pretty well.
Misty caught Psyduck, and Brock got Vulpix,
but Ash hasn't captured any Pokemon lately.
He might be getting a little worried,
but now Ash'll try his luck with Hitmonchan.
The Punchy Pokemon
- Pi. -Chan.
Okay, Hitmonchan, ready for a match?
Chan.
Monchan.
Hitmonchan, Pikachu's going to teach you a lesson.
-Pikachu, attack. -Pika.
Pika, pika, pika, chu!
That's it, Pikachu. Now jab, jab.
Now give it the big uppercut.
Pika, pika, pika, Pikachu.
-Chan! -
Chu!
Make Pikachu stop, Ash. This isn't even a fight.
Pikachu, give me that special punch I just taught you.
-Pika, pika! -Chan.
Give it the rocket punch.
Pikachu!
- Huh? -Pika.
We did it.
-They did? -No way.
Pikachu.
-Pi. -Chan.
So much for the great rocket punch.
How many times do I have to tell you, don't drop your guard.
-Chan. -Keep your gloves up, Hitmonchan,
because fighting smart hurts less than fighting stupid.
-Chan. -Now go knock that pipsqueak out.
-Hitmon. -
-Hitmonchan, hit. -Ah!
-Hitmon, hitmon, hitmon. -
-Cha! -Pikachu.
Hitmonchan.
Chu.
-Pikachu, are you okay? -Pika, pika.
I declare Hitmonchan the winner. Congratulations.
One, two, three.
-Hooray! -Chan!
-I wonder who this guys is? -He's a pretty serious trainer.
-I guess it wasn't wild. - Daddy.
-Daddy, please come home. -Rebecca?
Daddy, please quit Pokemon training and come home with me.
I won't come home until I become champion in the P1 Grand Prix.
Daddy.
I'll be in the Gym taking on challengers.
The Gym's that way. I'll be waiting for you.
Uh...
-Oh, well. -Aha.
Can I be of help to you, young lady?
-I'm really sorry my father bothered you. -No problem.
Can I ask a favor of you, Pokemon trainers,
a really, really big favor?
Please feel free to ask. We'll be glad to help in any way possible.
Thank you.
Please, I want you to defeat my father's Hitmonchan.
Huh?
-We'll do it for you. -Ah!
The Fighting Spirit Gym.
This sure doesn't look like an ordinary Pokemon Gym.
What's the P1 Grand Prix?
P1 is short for the Pokemon number one Grand Prix.
It's a tournament for fighting Pokemon.
Because my father wants to win the P1,
he's training all the time and ignoring his family.
So if we defeat that Hitmonchan,
your dad will come to his senses and go back home.
Right.
Ha, don't worry. Just leave it to us.
-Huh? -Leave it...
-To us? -Pika.
We'll take care of it.
Ash, don't you have a fighting Pokemon we can use?
What are you talking about?
You don't mean Primeape, do you?
Primeape!
Ape-prime!
Yeah, Primeape should be able to do the job.
And I've got Geodude.
We'll both enter the tournament and defeat that Hitmonchan.
A big Pokemon match.
And feast your eyes on that prize.
I'd love to get my hands on that championship belt.
And if we sold the belt,
we could go and stuff ourselves at the all-you-can-eat buffet.
Unlimited food.
Honey-glazed ham, roast leg of lamb, strawberry jam.
Sirloin steaks, chocolate cakes.
Can't you numbskulls think of anything but food?
What would you do with the money, Jessie?
-Who me? -Yes, Jessie.
What would you do if you had some extra cash?
First, I'd go to the salon and get a complete facial.
Then I'd get my hair and makeup done.
Then I'd go on a major shopping spree. Dresses, then handbags, then shoes.
Then I'd do a bit of jewelry shopping.
And after all that, I'd invite some close friends over
for a nice quiet dinner at home.
I hate to interrupt your internal dream sequence,
but shouldn't we figure out how to get into this competition?
Only fighting Pokemon are allowed.
Of which we currently have none.
Well, then, we'll just have to borrow one, won't we?
All we have to do is find one. Hmm.
-Like that one there. - What is it?
Hitmonlee, the kicking fiend.
Ah.
Ladies and gentlemen,
our fighting Pokemon Festival, the P1 Grand Prix,
is about to begin.
Now we've got our fighting Pokemon.
Thank you. Please remain seated.
The contestants in the P1 Grand Prix
are about to enter the ring.
Introducing the number one contender,
the fighting machine Hitmonchan and its trainer Anthony.
Hitmon.
And now the challenger, the kicking fiend,
Hitmonlee, along with its trainer Giant.
Stand up straight. You're making me dizzy.
I'm tired. Let's trade places.
-Ah! -Quit complaining.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
two new Pokemon trainers competing here in their P1 debut.
-Oh, no, not you again. -Huh?
Hmm...
-Hey, Ash, what's the matter? -Uh, nothing, I guess.
And now for our first match, Machop is ready to battle.
What Pokemon will Ash use to challenge it?
I choose you, Primeape.
Primeape.
Primeape.
-Machop. -Primeape.
Primeape!
-Get up, Primeape. -It looks beat.
And it looks like Machop has the advantage
in the battle with Primeape.
Machop may be small, but it sure packs plenty of power.
- -This looks bad.
Machop's mega-muscle power stops Primeape's kick cold.
It looks like Machop's getting ready for its special attack.
Special attack?
Machop. Its body is pure muscle.
Its special attack is the seismic toss.
Oh, no. It's going to toss Primeape.
-Machop. -Primeape.
Ah!
Primeape.
Primeape, are you okay?
-Primeape. -All right, good.
-Now, we're not going to quit. -Primeape!
Watch out for that seismic toss and give it everything you've got.
Primeape.
-That's amazing. -What's amazing?
Primeape used to do just what it wanted and never listened to anybody.
-But now it's taking orders from Ash. -Pika.
Primeape, scratch attack.
Primeape. Primeape.
Jump, Primeape!
Prime... Attack.
Mega kick right now.
-Machop. -Primeape. Primeape.
-We did it. - And this match is over.
Machop is down and out. Ash's Primeape wins the battle.
-That Primeape, it's really tough. -Monchan.
It seems like everything changed when Ash dove to save Primeape.
That's when Primeape started to trust Ash.
Pika, pika.
Primeape. Primeape. Primeape.
Our next match is between Hitmonlee and Geodude.
Fans, Geodude is hard as a rock.
Will Hitmonlee be able to crack Geodude?
Rebecca, don't worry. Everything's under control.
-Brock, watch out behind you. -Huh?
Monlee.
This won't take very long.
Ah! Geodude, this time, hit Hitmonlee.
Dude.
Don't show any mercy.
Kick, kick, kick.
Hitmonlee. Lee, lee, lee...
Geodude's going to get turned into gravel.
-Brock. -
-Brock. -
Huh?
If you're a real man, you know when you have to admit defeat.
Time to face facts.
You can lose today and win tomorrow.
Right.
Fans, Brock has thrown in the towel.
Geodude.
-I'm sorry. Are you okay? -Geo.
You don't have to apologize. You gave it your best shot.
Dude.
Don't worry, you'll be as solid as a rock again soon.
Primeape and I will take care of things now, Brock.
-I'm counting on you, Ash. -Right.
Machop wins.
-Monchan. -Hitmonlee.
Primeape.
Yay!
Now Ash's Primeape will advance to the final match,
while the Fighting Spirit Gym's very own Hitmonchan,
the number one contender at this tournament,
takes on the legendary kicking fiend Hitmonlee
for a chance at the championship.
This is a tough opponent. If we play fair, we may lose.
Not with the plan I cooked up with Meowth.
And speaking of cooking, I'm broiling in here.
-Get back in. -Hmm.
Keep on moving. Keep on fighting.
-Remember, you're a champion. -Monchan.
Hitmonchan. Hit. Hitmon. Hit.
-Monlee. -Chan.
Got to be smart. Got to be strong. Got to keep moving.
Lee, lee, lee...
Hitmonchan. Hitmonchan.
Hitmonlee is not landing any kicks.
We've got to slow Hitmonchan down.
And a little gloppy glue should do it.
Hitmonchan. Chan.
Hitmonlee.
Hitmonchan's in trouble.
Hitmonlee's mega kick is getting the best of Hitmonchan.
Hitmonchan.
This is dangerous. You should forfeit the match right now.
Lee, lee, lee...
Finish it, Hitmonlee.
Hitmonlee.
Stop it!
Don't hurt my father's Pokemon.
-Rebecca. -
-Aw. Are you all right? -I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
Oh, Daddy.
Are you hurt, Rebecca?
-No, I'm fine. -I'm glad.
I give up.
Anthony throws in the towel.
Hitmonlee is the winner.
Eh, good work, Hitmonchan. Are you okay?
Monchan.
I'm sorry I worried you and your mother so much.
-Oh, Daddy. -That's my girl.
-Isn't that great? -The family's back together.
-That means we're up against Hitmonlee. -That's right.
Your battling brought them back together.
And now all Ash needs to do is win one more time to be champion.
-Pikachu.
- Don't bet on it. -
Huh?
I can't wait for the chance to show you three little goody-goodies
what losers you are.
You don't stand a chance against us. We're going to win that championship belt.
And after we do, you can find us at the all-you-can-eat buffet table.
-Oh! -Will you be quiet?
-It's them again. -Team Rocket.
How did you ever guess?
Ha!
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the st... Oh, I can't take it.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
-Surrender now. -Ah!
Surrender now or prepare to... Prepare to...
-Uh, we're not finished. -Hmm.
As I was saying, we are going to be the winners around here.
-And you can bet your buffet on that. -
And now for the final confrontation.
Primeape, a newcomer who's battled to this last round
with tremendous attacks,
faces the ferocious footwork of Hitmonlee, the kicking fiend.
Get ready, fans, for a match you'll never forget.
You can't just defend yourself, Primeape. Attack.
If you can't get inside Hitmonlee's kicks, you'll never win the battle, Primeape.
Primeape, get in there and show Hitmonlee that you're not afraid.
Primeape.
-You did it. -All right.
-What are you doing? -Kick it. Kick it.
Pikachu.
-The secret weapon is ready. -Aha.
All you got to do now is use this remote control.
Have Hitmonlee jump up, and then flip the switch.
A hundred thousand volts will run through the ring
followed by an explosion.
Primeape will get a charge out of that.
Pika. Pika, pi.
-What is it, Pikachu? -Pikachu. Pikachu. Pikachu.
Look, I don't have time for this now, okay?
-Hang in there, Primeape. -Pika.
Pika.
Monlee.
-Hit it. -You got it.
-Nothing's happening. -Something's wrong?
-Hitmonlee. -Primeape.
Primeape.
All right. Use the seismic toss now, Primeape.
- Oh, no. -This is bad.
Primeape.
We did it.
Hitmonlee.
And it's all over.
Primeape defeats Hitmonlee with a seismic toss.
Ash's Primeape wins by a knockout.
Primeape is the new P1 Pokemon Grand Prix champion.
-We did it! -All right!
-It's prime time for Primeape. -Primeape. Primeape.
I'm proud of you, Primeape. Congratulations.
Primeape.
Ash, this Primeape has got a lot of natural fighting talent.
-You think so? -Mm-hm.
Why don't you let me train it for a while?
I promise to turn it into a real P1 champion.
A true P1 champion.
-What went wrong, Meowth? -What happened to our secret weapon?
Pika.
Pikachu.
Here it is. It looks like it works.
Pika.
Really appreciate it.
Ah!
Oh!
Team Rocket's blasting off again.
Prime. Prime.
Please take care of Primeape. I'm counting on you.
There's no need to worry. You can depend on me.
And I'll make sure my father spends
-lots of time with our family. -Mm-hm.
You keep on training and winning, Primeape,
and I'll always be grateful and proud that I knew a real P1 champion.
-Prime. Primeape. -Mm.
-Bye. -Goodbye and thank you.
Nice kid.
Just when they were beginning to understand each other,
Ash and Primeape go their separate ways.
Maybe they'll meet again someday somewhere.
But for now, new Pokemon and new challenges are waiting just ahead.
