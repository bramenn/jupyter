Give alien weapons to Earth!
Give them to Earth!
The cries to repel alien forces and
strengthen Earth defenses have been intensifying.
That would lead to the path of destruction.
Until now, the masses have
considered this war someone else's problem.
We will mass produce AHSMB units on the Rhinos' production line.
Is that why you disclosed information regarding the Rhinos units?
Deep Recon
Dang! So, would defeating a Lega-whatever in a game
be like vanquishing a midboss?
Wasn't he a Legatus?
It's their Military Commander equivalent.
Is a Military Commander high ranking?
Shouldn't he be?
Then isn't it about time we shed our title as the Fail Five?
Not if each midboss trashes all of our units.
Repairs are only 28 done for mine...
Mine is in similar shape.
You two have it good!
They said mine's smashed like a water flea.
What's a water flea?
A crustacean of the Branchiopoda class,
Diplostraca order, Cladocera suborder,
Anomopoda suborder, Daphniidae family, Daphnia genus.
In layman's terms, it's a type of plankton.
Oh, okay! But what does that have to do with your AHSMB?
Beats me.
Didn't you pay attention?!
Anyway, doesn't vanquishing a midboss unlock
an event that leads to power ups?
No, heroes are supposed to train next!
I don't wanna train.
Here! Thanks for waiting for Meal Set A.
Asagi, I gave you an extra serving.
I can't eat all of this.
Then I'll he-
You can have half of mine.
Nah, I'll pass...
What's wrong?
I'm not feeling terribly hungry.
That's not cool!
A hero must always eat well and sleep well, remember?
Randy! And Officer Ange, too.
Yep! Mr. Cool is in the house!
I heard you had a rough fight.
I know how to perk ya back up.
Why do we have to watch this in my room?!
Like it matters!
So whadda ya think of this one?
Where are you going?!
M-man, I've only got eyes for guns...
You won't know until you try.
He's right!
Isn't it nice how girls are so cute and soft?
I like'em firm!
I don't see it. You must have rather unusual taste.
Say, doesn't this actress kinda resemble Captain Amane?
You really have a thing for your superior officers, don't you?
Randy is definitely the type that loves to get stepped on!
Is that what turns you on, Randy?
Yeah! Aren't the kinda strict big sister types awesome?
I quiver with delight each time they order me around.
Masochistic freak.
Officer... Ange?! How long have you been here?
From the start.
Crap!
What the hell?! Why'd you turn it off?
Why is he in Violent Mode?
Listen up!
Nothing pisses me off more than when someone kills
a video when I'm watching it.
You'd better remember that!
Doesn't watching this give you the same sense of elation
as when we're fighting?
That's because the content is meant to arouse you.
That's not what I meant.
The realization that I'm alive
gushes up from the bottom of my heart.
It's like someone is telling me that I must
defeat more foes and survive!
That is precisely why I watch these videos.
When I watch them, I feel as though I am truly alive.
By experiencing the ritual related to the creation and birth of new life,
my resolve to fight to protect the next generation...
Uh, what was I gonna say?
You were trying to sound cool and failed!
No surprise coming from a failure at life.
Who'd you call a failure?!
That's your nickname!
I'm a bummer!
I can't hear a thing! I can't see a thing!
Don't call yourself that!
I-I know!
Guys, what do you plan on doing once the war is over?
To be honest, there is something I'd like to do.
Huh? Did I say something wrong?
Nah, not really.
Just wonderin', is Patrick an airhead?
That's right.
Then I shouldn't hold it against him.
Oh, yeah! I ordered a new video, so you can have this one.
Thank you very much!
Don't wind up makin' that girl cry with all these videos!
Who is that girl?
Meh, forget it.
This? I have a fiancee back on Earth.
A fiancee?
Yeah. My parents picked her out back when I was a kid.
But when I met her, she was just so cute and kind!
She's also very kind hearted, domestic and understanding!
I fell in love at first sight.
Aren't you getting married when the war is over?
Y-yeah.
You're getting married? Congratulations!
We've gotta work hard so that you can!
Do you have a hologram of her?
Sure do! Wanna see?
Well? Isn't she cute?
She really is cute!
I know, right?
That's cute?
She his mom?
The 1st and 2nd Mobile Units' supplies are down to 30.
Their warships are burning through artillery.
It hurts to have lost all of those skilled pilots, doesn't it?
Indeed. We can always build new fighters, but not new pilots...
Even if you combined the Bela-Russian and Great Chinese Alliance's forces
with the Organization of American States,
Europe Union and Pacific Rim-India Alliance,
we would not survive a
full-scale invasion the next time Earth is attacked.
In which case, the only thing we have in our favor
is the enemy's poor stamina.
OPEN
Couldn't you manage somethin'?
Yakitori Beer Simmered Giblets
Those bunnies put up a pretty good fight in their AHSMBs.
Their units were destroyed during the Gurantseere Defensive Battle.
Man, and they were my only hope!
No wonder Reika was bent outta shape.
I'm outta gas! I'm gonna die if I don't drink!
Then we oughta drink on her behalf.
Yep! Keep it comin'!
None of the countries have any military might left and they're run by morons!
I'm up a river without a paddle!
Same here.
I've got a secretive boss who's running me ragged
with preparing to launch the new mass production AHSMB models.
Gimme!
This?
That, too. But gimme those AHSMBs.
Sure, you can have'em.
Yay! You can't take that back later.
That's nothing if it'll make life easier on those kids.
A counter-attack combining all of Earth's forces, huh?
Those kids will lead the vanguard.
We really are horrible, aren't we? We really are horrible, aren't we?
The line extends beyond Uranus' orbit and in toward Jupiter...
So this is the Wulgaru's navigation route.
You wish to destroy the gate?
Is that even possible?
I suppose...
If you destroyed the gate's controls,
within a certain period of time, the gate would close.
Once it did, what would happen to the Wulgaru's invading army?
If they were cut from their supply route,
I imagine they would perish before long.
Would they withdraw before that happens?
Knowing my brother...
We have secured enough to sustain you.
I trust you.
I love your planet, Earth.
However, your star of hope is starting to grow clouded.
Are you referring to Izuru Hitachi?
If you lose his protection,
your planet will probably fall into my brother's hands.
After he claims your genes, there will be nothing left.
The Wulgaru truly are interested in nothing but our genes.
For the Wulgaru, obtaining them is life's greatest joy.
Do you know where the gate is located?
Even I do not know the current state of the gate.
In order to locate the enemy's gate,
I need you to conduct a long-range tactical reconnaissance mission.
What's this about a gate?
The gate is a dimensional hole that can be
created in locations with gravitic fluctuations.
We believe the Wulgaru forced the gate open,
which is how they came to our solar system.
You've heard this before!
I forgot.
The chance of a safe return is extremely slim.
This is a perilous mission.
You are the only ones capable of pulling it off.
Wow, that's awesome!
Where is the gate?
It's past Saturn?!
Absurd! Humanity hasn't even reached Saturn yet.
So it's a one-way ticket, eh?
Look at this.
That's huge! It looks just like an erected-
What is that?
It's a booster bound to sublight-speed guided missiles.
But it still won't be fast enough.
We've also attached laser sails.
The laser propulsion will provide your
primary acceleration until you reach escape velocity.
Is this even possible?
Theoretically, you can accelerate to 10 the speed of light.
In which case, we'd reach our target in 50 hours.
It will take 120 hours to reach maximum acceleration.
What's wrong?
Wow, that startled me!
Venturing uncharted space! This is every man's dream!
Question, Ma'am!
Couldn't we take the Godinion?
The Godinion is too large to handle accelerating
on that makeshift booster.
What if you forced it to?
I'm confident it would get torn apart.
Then what about our units?
According to my calculations, the Rhinos should be fine.
According to your calculations...?
Is there a possibility that the enemy will find us?
You'll be fine getting there.
But when returning, you'll decelerate upon making
a gravity turn at Jupiter.
There is a possibility that they could strike then.
That's right.
Let me reiterate: This mission must be carried out in absolute secrecy.
Do not let the Wulgaru catch you searching for their gate.
The future of Earth rests on this reconnaissance mission!
We're counting on you.
Yes, sir!
Commence Operation: Eagle Landed.
Awesome! I've never seen a booster like that before.
We're doing a test run for a new top-secret weapon.
Whatcha think? Pretty cool, right?
It's incredible!
Damn! I wish my unit wasn't all busted up.
There is no need for you to help.
We can handle this one ourselves!
But-
Give us a chance to show off every now and then.
Dude, I'll prove to ya that we're the real heroes around here.
No, I'm not handing over my role as the hero.
Then let's duke it out to see who the real hero is when I get back.
I'm holding you to that.
Have I ever broken a promise?
You break them all of the time!
Yeah. It's far rarer for you to keep them.
Dudes, as my teammates, you oughta back me up!
Tamaki!
I'd like to tell you something when I get back.
You would?
Want me to introduce you to Guiliano?
No, that's not it...
It's not? Then were you after Siegfried?
You've got it wrong!
Then was it Master Daneel all along?!
Whatever shall I do?
You haven't eaten since before that last mission, have you?
I could bake you a cake.
Cut the guy some slack.
What was that?
Everyone!
It's time for your checkups.
Checkups?
Right. You just finished another big mission,
so we're going to give you checkups.
So? How'd it go, Patrick?
How'd what go?
Don't be so shy!
Didn't you tell Tamaki how you feel before we left?
N-n-n-not yet!
That's no fun.
But I just found out what Tamaki's favorite food is.
I'll win her over with that.
Oh, good thinking!
Are you seriously going to be okay?
I had some sent up all of the way from Earth.
I'll give it to her when I get back.
Best of luck to ya!
Thanks!
Tamaki Irie, please accept this.
Tamaki Irie, please accept this.
I gained more weight!
I knew it!
They seem to be havin' fun over there...
It's grimy over here.
It's stuffy and crowded!
Visual on Neptune.
We've reached the final veering point.
Wow! So that's Neptune!
We're the first humans in history to make it this far.
I'm going to set our swing-by maneuver.
I'm countin' on ya!
Which will it be: Heavy G and get there quick
or a slow and easy ride?
I'd prefer the easy-
Obviously we're gonna take the quicker method!
Yeah, I figured as much.
Man!
Great! Report in via our secure line.
Roger!
Static...?
What's wrong?
I can't get through.
Just a sec. I'll look into it.
Problem found!
A solar storm is emitting
extremely strong electromagnetic interference.
What range are we lookin' at?
Everywhere between us... and Jupiter.
Well, jeez! It looks like we're stuck
goin' home so we can hand the info over!
And here I thought this was an easy job
where we just transmitted the data we found.
Well, there's no such thing as an easy job!
Changing course.
Disconnecting from the sails in
Disconnect.
We successfully disconnected.
Sweet! Ignite the booster!
Even with a G canceler, this is brutal!
They oughta pay us overtime for this!
It would help cover all of my upcoming dates!
Just how much are you gonna spend on her?
We're gonna zoom by!
Set all of your sensors to auto. We can't miss the gate!
I see it!
Another exam?
Right. I'm concerned about some of the results that came up.
How is everyone else?
They will reach the rendezvous point in 10 hours.
Due to a solar storm, we are unable to reach them.
Can you find them via optical tracking?
It hasn't picked them up yet.
Do you think they're all right?
All we can do is go in the hopes that they are.
Rate of deceleration increasing from 60 to 70.
We will reach our target speed in 30 seconds.
Be sure to keep your eyes peeled!
I'm pulling my radar up.
We're under attack!
Patrick, can you get through?
The solar storm is still interfering!
I see... Leave this to me and get outta here!
But-
Hurry! Every second counts!
Roger!
There is an emergency transmission!
Requesting reinforcements! Randy is currently engaging the-
Right now, we are at Jupi-
Did you get the data?
We can't receive it due to the strong interference from the solar storm!
No matter what the cost, you must recover that data!
Commander!
I repeat, retrieving that data takes top priority.
Roger.
Siegfried, open the solar sails!
Guiliano, ask Star Rose for an emergency laser propulsion shot.
Roger!
Do you think Randy will be all right?
We have to carry on his will.
We must- we must- get this information back.
It's the same fighter from earlier!
I'll hold him back!
Go, Patrick!
But-!
The fate of Earth rests on this information! Go!
Okay!
At the very least, I want you to survive.
First I'll take your right arm!
Then your left arm!
And your legs.
That was far too easy...
It was hardly beautiful.
I've gotta hurry and inform everyone!
Tamaki!
Patrick!
My radar is... not malfunctioning.
And my sensors are operational, too.
For him to have disappeared before anyone retrieved him...
Damn it!
I have to get back somehow...
If I don't relay this information, we really will have died like dogs!
I'm so close! Move, dammit!
Is this the end?
Tally-ho!
Randy?! You're still alive?
Don't go killin' me off just yet!
I've gotta let them bunnies know who the real hero is.
They got Patrick! Please hurry to the Godinion!
That's your job.
Let me handle things here. You get goin'!
But my unit-
Don't give me that bullshit! I said to go!
Outta ammo, huh?
It turned on!
Go!
Sorry!
Randy!
The lives of everyone on Earth are hangin' on that information...
It's cool; just go...
Randy!
Oh, yeah. Please pick up that new video I ordered, Chandra...
Randy!
What the hell?
You're a bummer clear up to the end...
What's the situation?
Black 6 has taken off.
I've identified a large explosion in our target direction.
What does that mean?
There is an enemy battleship!
Offer support fire!
It's too far away!
Please link my unit to the fire control system!
I will calculate the trajectory.
Authorization granted!
Sensors, linked! Coordinate axis, transferred!
Roger!
Correcting precision error of 0.3.
Firing all scatter lasers!
There are signs of impact.
I have an 87.5 estimate of the targets' location,
speed and projected routes.
I'm sending the specifics.
I've got the info!
We have a 250 rate of convergence!
Target: The Wulgaru flagship!
My main cannon is ready to fire!
Fire!
I'm firing everything I've got!
Such tactics lack any form of beauty.
It fails to excite my DNA in the least.
Gate's coordinates... verified...
