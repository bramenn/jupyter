What?!
You'll end it if you're still in first place when you start your final chapter,
and not after ten weeks instead?
Yes. Please inform the Chief Editor of the change.
So, that means you're aiming to get first place for 16 weeks in a row?
That's what I announced to Team Fukuda.
Then they said they'd go for first place themselves to stop me from ending CROW.
I'm even more motivated now.
I'm definitely not losing to any of them!
Niizuma, would you mind if I told the other editors about this?
What do you mean?
If I tell them about this, all the editors will try to prevent you from ending CROW
by helping someone else take first place.
That includes me, of course.
I don't want you to end CROW.
Go right ahead.
The entire editing department is my enemy!
This is good! I'm getting more and more excited!

Yeah.
He'll probably get first place this week too.

We said we'd pass him, but it's not as easy as it sounds!
How interesting.
Forget five weeks.
If anyone manages to beat me even once before I start my final manuscript,
I won't end CROW!
It's a challenge!
But... I want to beat him!
He's planning to end CROW?
He can't do that!
It's not good for the company, either!
Well, it's not like I want that to happen, you know.
I think it's best for both the author and the manga to let the author choose when to end it, though.
Don't be naive!
From the moment a manga is printed in a magazine,
it's no longer the author's sole property.
Are you really that much of a corporate stooge, Nakano?
What was that?!
Before you start talking about what's best for the company,
you should think first about what's best for Niizuma, and that's to keep drawing!
CROW is a manga that can be further developed!
Niizuma is still young!
Now's the ideal time for him to develop!
It's your job as his editor to maximize his potential!
Keeping the readers happy and making the magazine even more appealing!
If you remember those basic principles of our job as editors,
then it's unthinkable that we'd ever consider letting him end CROW.
That's right! Both Niizuma and CROW can still gain greater heights!
Don't let him end it here!
Yuujirou, have you tried talking him out of it yet?
What good would that do? The Chief Editor himself agreed to his demand.
In that case, someone else has to surpass CROW.
Quite frankly, that's gonna be pretty tough to pull off.
No, that's exactly why it has to be done!
Whoever gets their author to surpass CROW will get bragging rights!
Of course, I fully intend to get those.
No, this time I'll get them!
No, me!
A seven chapter competition means...
We could do a four chapter arc and a three chapter arc,
and build them up to a climax in the final chapters to get first place!
No, I don't think that'd work.
You don't?
That's the way we've always done it,
and yet we've never surpassed CROW even once.
In that case, what should we do?
I think we need to be more unorthodox.
More unorthodox?
Yes.
CROW is a typical standard battle manga.
The main stylistic difference between our works is that PCP is unorthodox.
That's why we should go all out on making it even more unorthodox.
I see.
How do we go about doing that, though?
Remember that unorthodox standard battle manga we were planning to make next?
Let's try that idea out here.
Takahama
The editing department doesn't want to see CROW end.
We have to somehow
I'll surpass him!
Ashirogi Mutou...
Niizuma Eiji...
Surpassing them has always been my goal!
I'll go up against them with this next arc that I've been thinking about for a while.
Yeah!
I like this old guy as a new character.
And these friends he gathers, too!
He's a legendary racer who takes a liking to GIRI.
The old guy and his friends team up with GIRI,
then teach him a legendary driving technique!
An unimaginable, secret training regimen!
And once he's learned the legendary technique...
He gets a new bike!
That'll be sweet!
Awesome!
It's perfect!
I know, right?!
An appealing new character raises your manga's popularity.
That's a basic rule.
That, plus a new bike too!
With this, surpassing CROW isn't just a dream anymore!
Dream? I'll turn it into reality!
No way!
Me?! Get first place?!
Yes.
That's impossible, of course!
You even told me before that it's impossible for a gag manga to get first place!
Yes, if you were still doing a gag manga, that is.
However, starting now,
you're going to remake Never Reaching You into a plot-driven manga full of laughter and tears.
That's what I've been trying to do from the beginning, though.
Why does it seem like a gag manga, then?
Do you know?
No.
Why?
It's the art!
Ugh, I'm running late.
Gulp, I feel sick. I'm about to throw up.
The art?!
With characters like these, of course it's going to seem like a gag manga!
You're going to transform the art within the next five weeks to turn it into a serious, negative love story.
B-But you can't change the art that easily
You have Nakai.
His sketching abilities are the real thing.
No! I refuse to be taught by him!
Are you that against it?
I am!
I just got an idea.
Need to write it down...
Good. It looks like he got the right amount of negativity from the thought of calling Nakai Sensei.
All that's left is...
Yamashita, how's it going at your end?
Erm, yes.
We came to the conclusion
that instead of taking a risk, we'll just work to preserve and maintain her current rank.
I see.
So Aoki said that she definitely wants Hiramaru to try and go for first place.
Oh? She said that if he did that, she'd think that he's really cool and amazing?
I didn't say any of those things.
Well, she did say that she'd like to help Hiramaru in any way she can.
I see.
So she said that if Hiramaru got first place, she'll grant any one wish of his, huh?
Th-This is Hiramaru.
Could you please hand it over to Aoki?
What is it, Hiramaru?
What?
If I get first place, can you start calling me Kazu instead?!
Kazu, is it?
Okay.
All right!
Mr. Yoshida, let's get first place, no matter what!
Please call me Kazu!
That's all he wanted?
A new villain?
He seems more like a protagonist, though.
Yes.
I've been thinking about this.
A cool character who seems like he'd be the protagonist of a standard battle manga.
If we use him in an unorthodox standard battle manga,
we should make him more of an evil hero , I think.
An evil hero, huh?
During the copycat arc, I realized that characterization makes a villain stand out.
You stole the textbooks from everyone and hid them in the gym storage room.
Hmph! Of course you got caught.
You put out a notice of intent to steal. If it had gone successfully, it would look like PCP had done it, and you'd have been gloating over your copycat crime.
PCP wouldn't have hidden them in such a place.
Akechi...
when did you realize that I was the culprit, and not PCP?
I knew from the beginning that it wasn't PCP.
Yeah. In that arc, the antagonist was just a lone student who couldn't be considered much of a villain.
The next villain we make shouldn't be an ordinary criminal.
He should be like...
the Fiend with 20 Faces, or something like that.
That's good!
He won't show his face, but he'll judge PCP
and give them advice sometimes!
I've got an image in mind!
I'm on a roll now!
I'll make it into a script by tomorrow!
Oh! This is the introduction of a new character, right?
You can't even tell if he's a friend or an enemy.
PCP's trying to find out his identity.
This is good!
Naming him Sigma was a good idea.
Thanks.
Okay, the storyboard is fine as it is.
Let's go up against Niizuma with this new character!
Right!
This bike's design... Is it from Toriyama?
You can tell?
Um... The documents on the false charges case were over here, I think.
That's not good enough for a rough sketch! Not good enough!
Yes, Nakai-sensei.

CROW took top spot in Issues 24 and 25.
But the real showdown is in Issue 26 here.
Right.
Whoa! GIRI has a new character, too!
H-Hiramaru's art got better!
You're right!
You can tell that more enthusiasm than usual was put into most of the manga here.
It's Niizuma's influence.
This'll do it.
Yes.
We'll win!
How's this for an art change?
You did well, Hiramaru.
You're not a hard worker, but you can do anything once you put your back into it.
It's all so she'll call me Kazu...
The first chapter of the arc... If I can reel people in with this...
We'll definitely rank higher than Eiji with this!

PCP was 4th this week.
CROW placed 1st again.
Dammit.
The chapter introducing Sigma wasn't enough.
There's no need to be so disappointed.
Going by the vote counts, PCP's went up by 21.
What?
There were many other manga whose vote counts increased.
Conversely, CROW's dropped by 33.
So that means we're within 100 votes of CROW?
Seigi no Mikata
Road Racer GIRI
Because Fukuda, Takahama, and the others are so trying hard,
CROW's votes got split up, increasing the chances of getting first place.
It seems like we're just relying on others, then.
That's not true.
The manga that gets first place is the best manga.
There's no mistaking that.
Yes.
The editing department is getting anxious as well.
Anxious?
Over which manga will take the top spot and defeat CROW.
B-By the way, which one does the editing department think is the front-runner?
Right now,
it's Seigi no Mikata.
It's a tale of friendship between the protagonists a prosecutor named Akira and a detective named Hiroto.
The new drama is well done.
The Complete Book of the Six Codes
Trial Records
The Complete Book of the Six Codes
Unfortunately, you're 6th again this week.
I can do it, Miura.
The beginning of the arc coming in at 6th place.
It's just as I predicted.
It's going to get more exciting from here on,
and I'll go for first place with the issue where I have a front cover color spread.
Yeah, you're right!
This arc can...
Detective Hiroto, charged as a suspect with no memory of the incident.
Akira, who knows Hiroto well and is confident of his innocence, is nevertheless put in charge of exposing his crimes.
While conflicted, he faces a trial in which he must prosecute his best friend.
And the final chapter will reveal a shocking plot twist with an overturned verdict.
I see.
So, the climax of his arc will happen when he gets the front cover?
Nice one.
On the other hand, it'd be tough to swallow if he doesn't get first place there.
C-Can PCP get the front cover spread after that, then?
No, Road Racer GIRI's already taken that spot.
3rd again?
A new character and a new bike had no effect?
Okay.
So, CROW is 1st?
The ranks are the same, but the vote counts have gotten closer.
I see.
Then, at the very least,
I'll probably get first place in a month.
A month? Oh, the front cover color spread.
From the day I got the idea for a new bike,
I already started drawing a color spread of GIRI straddling it.
Getting a really early head start?
Isn't it a bit much to spend a whole month drawing it?
That's how much effort I'll need to put in to surpass CROW.
I see.
A front cover color spread, huh?
I'm jealous.
Well, we did just have one for PCP.
I thought you'd say that,
so I petitioned the Assistant Chief Editor for a color page.
Really?!
Yeah.
A front cover is tough, but I can get you a colored center page instead.
He promised to give me one before Niizuma finishes drawing his final chapter.
All right!
I'm grateful for just a center page!
Thank you!
We bet everything on the introduction of the new character, Sigma,
but even then we didn't catch up to him.
This colored center page will most likely be our last chance!
Do your best!
The ones who'll stop Niizuma's first place run will be you, Ashirogi Mutou!
Yes!
First place run, huh?
Well, Niizuma's gotten first place ten weeks in a row by now, right?
By the original agreement,
he would've already gotten permission to wrap up CROW in the next 10 weeks and then end it.
Yeah.
To Niizuma, aren't we just nuisances getting in his way of ending CROW?
That doesn't seem to be the case.
Really?!
I'm glad everyone is getting more votes!
I... see.
So, you're happy about it.
Yes!
It wouldn't be interesting otherwise.
It's thrilling!
If I can continue to get first place in this situation, I can end this in the coolest possible way!
He said that?
I want to outwit Niizuma as well.
We'll definitely surpass him!
Right!

2nd, huh?
So, the front cover we pinned our hopes on wasn't good enough.
It was really close, I'm telling you.
I'm happy.
It's the first time I've ever gotten 2nd place.
Oh, I see.
Getting 2nd place on a chapter that isn't your first one, for a serialization that's not even two years old.
That's impressive indeed.
There's still five weeks to go before Niizuma begins to draw his final chapter, though.
I won't give up just yet!
Takahama.
The next non-mainstream manga to rise to the top won't be Ashirogi Mutou's,
it'll be mine!
So Takahama got 2nd, huh?
Yeah, it was close.
I'm glad, actually.
Because now, my front cover color spread will be the one to overtake Niizuma next week!

Hey, Fukuda?
Why did you open it, stupid?!
I'm sorry!
Fukuda may feel bitter about it, but CROW won with a full 70 vote margin.
He should've brought out the new bike in this chapter instead.
It didn't have enough impact to live up to the front cover.
Hey, get off your high horse.
Hiramaru's Never Reaching You ranking didn't improve at all.
Tell me about it.
I suppose there was no point in trying to make his art better.
But at this rate, nobody can stop CROW from ending.

We still have four weeks!
Yes, but...
In Issue 34, right before Niizuma begins his final chapter,
PCP will have a colored center page.
Maybe that's where it'll happen.
If GIRI couldn't beat CROW even with a front cover color spread,
beating him with just a colored center page seems really tough.
I think your color pages are better than Fukuda's, though.
That's not it.
Can't we do something special with the color page?
Something only a series like PCP can do.
A setup like only PCP can do?
Yes.
Um,
how about making something pop out only when you wear 3D glasses?
That means we'd have to provide the 3D glasses to the readers.
Besides, can you even draw something in 3D?
I see.
Yeah, you're right.
I don't really have an idea for it,
but somehow having the content of the chapter synced up in some way with the color page...
That's an interesting concept, but hard to pull off.
It'd be amazing if we could, though.
Yeah.
If you can tie it in with a PCP-like scheme, that'd be great.
We only have 4 weeks left.
I'll think of something.
At least with our colored center page...
You don't have much time.
I know.
I was so confident in front of Hattori, but it's too hard.
I've got nothing!
What'll we do?
We're out of time, and it's too late to set something up with the color page.
No.
Let's dig in our heels until the last minute.
We'll do something with the color page.
Let's think about it until the last minute!

Ah, it finally stopped raining.
Ugh, it's so depressing in here.
Connecting the content and the colored title page...
The more I think about it, the harder it is.
How pretty!
I got it!
Since it's in color, how about you draw a rainbow that's actually a code?
There's seven colors in a rainbow, so it means something will happen at 7 o'clock! Good, right?
Oh, sorry.
That's too simple, isn't it?
Kaya, thank you, but could you keep quiet
Time...
Saikou, do you have a watch?

Makoto alone in his room, huh?
It has a different feel than usual. It's tasteful and cool!
I like it.
Great work as usual, Mashiro.
This is perfect for the color page, but what about the chapter itself?
Leave it to us.
Okay.
Call me when the storyboard is done.
Okay.
Good work.
Hattori didn't notice a thing.
It would've been weird if he had!
A trick in the color page.
You were right to insist on it.
Now we just need to make a chapter that will maximize this trick's potential!
Yeah!
This is our last chance to surpass Eiji!
I'll put everything I have into it!

CROW has been in first place for 14 weeks in a row.
Hattori, how is Ashirogi's manuscript coming along?
Well, they were supposed to finish the storyboard today
You got me.
Mashiro, do you have a copy of the color page you gave me last week for this chapter?
Yes.
Who would have thought the trick was in the color page?
It's good.
You're using the color page to your advantage.

I thought something was fishy about them,
but who'd have thought they were actually a challenge from Sigma!
This approach is good!
You did well!
We can pass CROW with this!
Yes!
We'll overtake CROW with this chapter.
I'm confident in it.
I won't let him end CROW!
And I'll make PCP the manga that constantly dominates CROW!
I'll do it!
Who will stop Niizuma's run at the top?!
I won't lose to anyone!
But your series will end!

Dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams
As soon as I reach my goals, it all falls through again
So why do I run...
We met after such a long time
Has the mood changed for us?
So much time has passed
It seemed like more fun back then
We've lost so much
I already know that, though
Don't stop screaming, don't stop struggling
You've done enough for others
I still, still have something I haven't told you yet
Beyond each of my dreams lies yet another dream

Why, I wonder?
Whenever I am close to fulfilling my goals, all effort becomes fruitless
We walk ahead, hold each other, and with little things
we support each other to reach what we promised
When we lack confidence, we put a hand to our heart
and reread the pages we assembled into a story
They lead up to today and continue into the morrow
We will always be ourselves
until the day that our dreams come true
