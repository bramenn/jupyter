It's the battle part of day four of the Grand Magic Games!
Due to the disqualification of Raven Tail,
Fairy Tail's A and B teams have merged and are now in a tag team battle!
Their opponents are Sabertooth!
It's a dream showdown between four Dragon Slayers!
Who will win, Fairy or Tiger?!
Wh-What's this?!
Sting and Rogue...
The Twin Dragons of Fiore's strongest guild are on the ropes!
He really is strong... But I'd be disappointed otherwise.
Gajeel...
Did you two really defeat dragons with power like that?
Not defeat...
I killed a dragon with this very hand.
Wasn't it your parent?
It's got nothin' to do with you.
From now, I'm gonna show you the power that killed a dragon!
White Drive...
Shadow Drive.
Sting and Rogue, the Twin Dragons of Sabertooth...
Dragon Slayers, like Natsu and Gajeel...
But their magic is still an unknown...
Well, let's see what happens...
I think they're done testing each other.
From here on in, they're going to get serious, so let's really cheer them on!
It's over, garbage guild.
Sting...
Yeah...
Alright, the silent face-off continues...
Which side will make the first move?!
Sabertooth's Sting makes his move!
Fairy Tail's Natsu held it back!
Receive Holy White Judgment!
Salamander!
Oh, my! It looks like Fairy Tail's Gajeel is at the mercy of Rogue's Shadow Drive!
You can't get ahold of shadows.
Take this!
Don't get in my way!
Squabbling in the middle of a match?! You guys sure have confidence!
Their power has suddenly increased.
Is that a kind of Dragon Slayer Magic?
Take care of business, Natsu!
What the hell?! You've gotten faster for some reason...
Come on, come on, Natsu-san! You call that defense?!
What on Earthland...?
It's a magic amplification technique.
On top of that, their combination skills are seamless.
This isn't as thrilling as I thought it'd be.
Compared to those two, it seems Fairy Tail's duo aren't in sync with each other.
Go! You're in your assured victory pattern!
Fro thinks so, too!
Four Dragons!
Sabertooth!
The tone of the crowd's cheering has changed.
Natsu-san and Gajeel-san...
It's only just begun. There's no need to be so anxious.
I admired you for the longest time!
And then I set my sights on surpassing you!
Now is that time!
Natsu!
That attack just now...
There's something different about it compared to previous attacks.
What do you mean?
And what the hell is that?! It looks like a Magic Circle...
C-Can't...
The Claw of the White Dragon is a holy attack.
A body that's marked by its stigmata loses its freedom.
And with this, I'll surpass you!
The dragon that becomes shadow hides its form.
It always takes down its prey!
It always takes down...
What is it?
Yeah!
That's the way, Gajeel!
He caught him! Even though before, he wasn't even able to land a hit!
Of course! After fighting for a while, Gajeel gets used to it.
Natsu can do the same thing with ease!
Get'im, Natsu!
How can you move?!
You burned off the stigmata!
Not too shabby...
But you've got a ways to go.
He burned it off... That guy knows no bounds...
Only the Salamander could do that... I guess I should say...
Don't get too stuck on yourselves, brats.
And don't make light of Fairy Tail!
Just like that! Go! Go!
That was great, Gajeel!
I-I can't breathe... Calm down, Levy!
Oh, my! The course of the battle has just shifted again!
You guys really are the best.
We have to give this our all and then some.
The Fist of the White Dragon even reduces flames to smithereens.
What is that magic?! The pressure is incredible!
I don't like this... I think it might be...
S-So bright! Yajima-san, what is this?!
Sting-kun is concentrating his magic into a single point.
Here I go, Natsu-san!
Dragon Slayer Arcana!
Holy Nova!
Whoa! What's this?!
He stopped that tremendous attack with one hand!
I-I don't believe it...
Huh?
No way...
I have no memory of that skill ever being blocked.
I see...
Now it makes sense why he would storm into our inn on his own.
I wonder what I could have seen if I hadn't stopped him then...
Sting-kun...
Yajima-san, what do you make of this?!
Gajeel!
Rogue...
So three months of training and Second Origin
made these two this strong, eh?
They belong to totally different ranks.
Even I can pick up on it.
The way they're cheering has changed again, right?
Yes.
Lucy, you were awake?
Yeah. I just can't sleep.
Natsu and Gajeel will win, won't they?
Wh-Who could have foreseen this development?!
The Twin Dragons of Sabertooth, helpless before Fairy Tail!
Will the match end like this?!
Like hell it'll end...
Yeah...
I knew this wasn't gonna be an easy wall to get over...
Sting-kun...
I know, Lector...
We made a promise, right?
I'm not gonna lose.
I can't lose...
For Lector's sake...
What the hell is this magic?!
They're...
Wh-What is this...?
Tremble at the true power of the Third Generation.
Impossible! They can activate it with their own will?!
Dragon Force...
Natsu kinda looked like that at the Tower of Heaven...
Yeah. Except...
And that time with Zero too, he unleashed that power by eating all of my magic.
But they're able to release the power of the Dragon by willing it?!
This is the Third Generation of Dragon Slayers.
Rogue, hang back.
I can take both of them on by myself.
U-Until just a minute ago, Sabertooth was being dominated!
Unbelievably, he's challenged both of them!
That's how much confidence he has, huh?
That's right!
Sting-kun and Rogue-kun have Dragon Force.
There's no way they can lose!
I was worried for nothing!
Fro forgot about Dragon Force, too!
I haven't seen it yet, but is it really all that?
Yeah. At this rate, the odds are against them.
It's gotten quiet...
Maybe they're finished?
No. It begins here...
Shall I check it out?
No, you don't have to.
I'm sure Natsu and Gajeel will be fine.
They're lookin' down on us...
But this feeling...
He's strong.
I-It's different...
Totally different from before!
Natsu-nii...
Holy Breath of the White Dragon!
W-What is it?!
We can feel the magic at this distance?!
That's because it's a battle between Dragon Slayers.
The cost is going to be heavy.
Natsu...
Gajeel...
Oh, dear! What is going on here?!
The floor of the arena is...
That was one fierce breath...
What incredible force...
Is this the power of the Third Generation Dragon Slayers?!
Gajeel!
Natsu!
It seems the battlefield is moving underneath the arena,
but the match will continue!
Everyone, please enjoy it on Lacrima-Vision!
I'm just getting started!
Sword Horn of the Fire Dragon!
Roar of the Iron Dragon!
The light of the White Dragon purifies all things...
Holy Ray!
Light?!
Holy attribute magic...
Fly.
Natsu can't guard against him?!
What happened to that confident mood from just before?!
Sting-kun really is strong, huh?
Fro thinks so, too!
Lector... I made you a promise...
Were you bullied again, Lector?
After all... nobody believes me!
I told them you beat a dragon, Sting-kun!
I'm not lying about it!
I know.
Never mind jerks like that.
I can't! They were saying bad things about you, Sting-kun!
I don't care.
I hate it when people say bad things about my friend!
Okay.
Then I'll prove you're not a liar.
There may not be any more dragons, but there is somebody called Salamander, right?
One day, I'll beat him, right in front of everybody.
I promise.
Are you watching this, Lector?!
I'm watching, Sting-kun!
It's become quiet again...
Could those tremors from before mean...?
It's alright. I mean, it's those two...
Right?
Natsu... Gajeel...
Times change.
The span of seven years has allowed us to develop into true Dragon Slayers.
The time of the old generation is over.
Yeah.
Uh-oh! They're not even twitching!
It's been a breathless seesaw battle,
but has Fairy Tail finally run out of steam?!
Natsu...
Gajeel...
What's wrong?! Get up!
You're stronger than this!
Even Natsu and Gajeel can't beat them?!
Damn, this sticks in my craw...
Natsu-nii! Stand up!
But you really were strong,
Natsu-san... Gajeel-san...
Are both of them down?!
Stand up, Natsu! Gajeel!
You can hear our voices, can't you?!
The guild's thoughts are one!
They're one with you!
Sting!
Yeah... Sorry I took Gajeel-san down, too.
But, y'know...
Don't be too hasty...
Fairy Tail!
Lucy-san! It feels like...
That's them, alright. No matter how many times they fall, they always get up again.
I don't know if that should be called tough or stubborn...
Awesome! I knew they could do it!
Look at that, Levy! Our voices reached'em!
They're standing!
We'd be in a bind if they weren't.
Ow...
You're better than I thought.
Incredibly, they're alive and kicking!
But I saw through all of your habits.
What?!
No way... It can't be...
This is a bad dream...
Fro thinks so, too...
Your attack timing... Your posture when you defend...
Even the rhythm of your breathing...
What?!
That's ridiculous! I'm using Dragon Force!
Yeah, and it packs a wallop! My body aches all over, dammit!
Don't get rattled, Sting. He's bluffing.
Bluffin', you say?
You really think the Salamander can pull off a trick that requires usin' his brain?!
Oh, shut up!
For example, when you attack, your pivot foot is facing 11:00.
Nah, it's 10:00.
It's 11:00!
I could let you slide with 10:30, but not 11:00!
I say it's 11:00! 23:00 is fine, too!
That's going around 360 degrees!
What are those two fools doing?!
They've got energy to spare. And that means they've still got fight left in them.
Arguing at a time like this...
Yeesh, they make me wanna crawl in a hole...
Oh, don't be like that. You and Natsu are two of a kind.
When you look at me objectively, that's what you see?
Clam it, already!
Wha...?!
Hey! You bastard!
Wh-What is this?!
Wh-What are you doing?
Gajeel...
I've totally gotta pay you back for lookin' down on us.
I can take both of you on by myself.
Go ahead, attack me at the same time!
Oh, boy! Now Natsu Dragneel of Fairy Tail
is challenging the two of them to a battle!
You're fired up, ain'tcha?
You'll pay for this, Salamander!
I swear, later...
Natsu, I trust you!
Leave it to me. Keep believin'!
You'd never betray me, would you?
I thought this was about the match... Of course not!
Natsu, you'd never do anything to make me sad, right?!
I wouldn't let anybody make you sad, Happy!
Listen... Somebody ate my fish!
Next time: Natsu vs. the Twin Dragons!
Happy... You gotta believe me...
Natsu...
I-I didn't know it was yours, Happy!
Natsu!
