H!
O?!
I do fall in love!
I just realised it for the first time
That I had fallen in love
Twenty-four hours a day thinking of you, you and nothing more than you!
It's something I wasn't consciously aware of
Somehow ( somehow) I'm feeling different from the usual
With you ( the two of us) and our dull chatter
Don't tell me ( mutual love?) Nope, it's a one-sided crush
This is bad! Our gazes met!
What, what? Why is my heart pounding like this?
Did a short circuit just make a mess out of my mind?
This is my first time... feeling like this...
I wonder if I have a fever
Suddenly and precipitately, love has arrived.
Instantly igniting my face into a bright red
T-That's stupid?! My hands are shaking
Is this really what they call love?
I-I did it! A conversation filled with stutters
This awkward silence... *mumble mumble*
Your... ( Your...) I want to know your feelings.
O-One-sided love
First love! The usual way to school
The shining light. I do fall in love!
I feel I could fly towards the sky
O-One-sided love
10
H H!
Woke up in the morning, brushed my teeth
In the blink of an eye, it's 10pm
Today, we laughed a whole lot
We had a great time
At times, with my friends, acting like fools, being noisy
Fluttering, our eyes met.
It's a coincidence, right?
I wouldn't call this my first love
It's not my character.
Say, will we be able to meet again tomorrow?
As my eyelids close
I see you sparkling all over the place
Today was fun, too, wasn't it?
I'm in love
So happy, so happy
It is my pleasure to meet you, my new-found love.
Surely, we'll meet again tomorrow
Have a good night
We'll meet immediately in our dreams
So have a good night

A Small Miracle
Narration: Seki Tomokazu
Nice weather.
It's about time to wake up the Professor.
Maybe I'll take a walk somewhere after breakfast.
Huh?
Wai -
Mio-chan, Mai-chan, selamat pagi.
Oh, Yukko, good morning.
Good morning.
It's sunny today, huh?
Even though they predicted rain yesterday.
TL note: Tenki means weather. Yukko is making a pun with a ten-key number pad.
Man, on a day with nice weather like this,
maybe I'll buy a ten-key number pad or something.
Just kidding.
W-What's with this lack of reaction?
So formidable! These two are really formidable!
Maybe...
Oh, man, I see.
That's a problem.
Maybe it went over their heads.
I'd better make my jokes simpler so that everyone can get them.
All right!
Man, isn't it hot?
It's so incredibly hot out, I could get a bald spot!
Just kidding.
This is frightening.
This is frightening.
The Virtual Generation is frightening.
But - Well, if someone close to you had a bald spot,
it wouldn't be very funny.
Wait!
I've reflected upon myself a little.
All right!
I'll try whipping it out for the first time in a while.
The sacred sword of Her Highness!
Hey, hey!
Hey, do you know what the guy who was attacked by a centipede said?
The centipede is coming!
Just kidding!
Surprising!
How surprising!
What's with these two?
Being able to keep a straight face after that...
No, wait a minute!
Maybe...
If they didn't hear me, I guess it can't be helped.
All right!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
They say this is what the guy who was attacked by a centipede said.
The centipede is coming!
Just kidding!
I can't believe they're this tough...
No, they've already reached level of an overlord.
Maybe...
Maybe...
They are expecting me to not be satisfied with the level I'm at now?!
They expect me to be dissatisfied with my...
If I back down here...
If I accept defeat here...
I'll be betraying their expectations!
That's why...
How could I back down?!
I'm perfectly prepared for...
I'm going to a bomb shelter!
When a valley is happy, it says hooray!
I'm wearing...
Well, in short,
if you substitute x into this equation,
you can find the answer.
After that, like last time...
President.
Ogi!
I haven't seen you in a while!
You haven't shown up for three months!
How have you been?
Uh, yes.
Well, perfect timing; I was really bored.
Let's go have some fun!
What do you want to do?
Play isse-no-se or something?
TL note: Isse-no-se is a Japanese numbers game played using both hands.
I've come to resign from the club.
I wonder why people always have to clear their throats in a movie theatre just before the movie starts.
And so, what happened then -
Websy, Fecchan!
Have you seen Sasahara?
Sasahara?
Oh, I saw him going up the stairs to the roof.
Thanks!
Misato's got it tough so early in the day.
That's what you call youth.
Should we go take a look?
Well, it could be for that, you know...
Oh.
Into the blue sky, leaving a cloud trail behind. Is it a right hand?
By Sasahara.
An excellent piece, isn't it?
Hey, Sasahara!
Do you have any idea what you've done?!
I was simply composing poetry on the rooftop...
Not that!
This! This thing here!
Don't you recognise it?
That is mine, is it not?
Why do you have it, Tachibana Misato?
Don't get the wrong idea!
You threw trash on the ground, so I picked it up for you!
No, no, I did not throw it away.
I simply dropped it without realising.
And this is not trash. It is a handkerch -
What?
Isn't everything you own trash?
How did you know I was the one who had dropped it?
Our homes should be in completely opposite directions.
And it has even been ironed...
A-Are you stupid?
What would give you that idea?
I just happened to walk down that road while pondering the truth of the world!
Thank you for going to the trouble, Tachibana Misato.
You drop things a lot in the morning, don't you?
I do not really notice it myself, but I wonder...
You're polluting the town like that! It causes problems!
W-Well, I don't really mind picking that garbage up for you.
But don't misunderstand!
I'm just doing it out of a voluntary spirit!
Man, Misato is always like that, isn't she?
Websy, what should we do with this?
Wai - Why'd you take it with you?!
What should we do with this?
Just leave it!
But what should I do with it?
I told you: just leave it!
Things you think are cool!
Super-car Bicycle!
I give up.
No help...
There is no God or Buddha.
Yesterday...
Tonkatsu?
TL note: Tonkatsu is deep-fried pork.
Well, whatever.
Huh?
How long... have we been here?
I think... I just fell asleep.
Well, whatever.
Wanna play... shiritori or something?
Orange.
Oh, sorry.
Say it again.
What was it?
Ke...
Ke...
Ke...
Can I say something completely unrelated?
Eggplants.
Eggplants.
She's dead.
No help is gonna come.
I'm paralysed.
It's finally down to just you and me, Sekiguchi.
Without at least three members, we'll be disbanded.
I wish there were a good way to recruit members.
President.
Hm?
What does our club do?
Man, I thought you'd come up with a good way to recruit.
We don't really do anything in particular.
On your mark.
Get set.
Go.
Hey, stop!
Don't take my uniform off!
What's wrong with it, Seki-san?
Please give me your uniform!
But hey, I didn't even get one point today!
It's perfectly fine!
It's your retirement uniform!
But still!
The uniform of a player that didn't even get one point in his last game isn't worth anything!
That's not true! I started playing soccer because of you, Seki-san!
W-Wait!
All right!
All right!
Then, I'll take it off on my own time!
Okay? Okay?
I'll take it off so let go, okay?
All right...
An opening!
I'm sorry.
Listen.
You should respect your elders from now on.
All right.
Honestly.
She's such a helpless kid.
This is bad, yet so fun!
Wait, wait!
From the beginning, I wanted to create a completely new club by combining go and soccer.
So I made this club.
But I couldn't think of how to do it.
First draw some boomerangs, then some triangles, then squares.
Professor, it's about time to go to bed.
All right.
Professor, did you eat snacks?
I didn't eat any.
Why are you looking away?
Maybe because it's the other way?
I don't know what you're saying!
See, look.
Why are you eating just before bed?
These... aren't mine.
Then who has chips stuck to her face?
Cough, cough.
I think I might have caught a cold.
What are you doing?
Why do you never listen when I say, No snacks before bed?
You're wrong!
Sakamoto told me to eat them!
A bubble's coming out of his nose.
A masterpiece!
Don't change the topic!
Well, brush your teeth and go to bed.
I already brushed my teeth.
You did?
You mean, before you ate snacks?
Yes.
I brushed them.
Why are you getting shy?
But you only need to brush them once.
No, you don't, not if you eat snacks.
Then have you brushed yours, Nano?
I've already brushed mine.
Then... Then...
I'm completely ready for bed!
You aren't, though, Professor.
You're a robot, Nano, so you can't get cavities anyway!
Nano!
Um... Um...
You can get little cavities, all right?
Is that true?
It's true.
It's a lie...
Ah, but look, they could get rusted!
Rust...
Then, I'll add a function to get cavities!
Don't worry.
I really will add it.
It's a promise, okay?
Okay!
Then Nano, come brush your teeth with me!
All right.
Although it's the second time.
It's already 10PM!
That's true.
Honestly.
Sasahara is never serious.
We are the egg twins!
We are!
Ow - Hot, hot, hot, hot!
Hot!
Hot!
N-Next time on Nichijou, i-it's episode 9!
L-Look forwar - H-Hot!
