Opening 1st Frame
Ending
We've got no choice.
It's a cruel world out there.
I'll defeat her...
No...
I'll kill her!
That day, mankind received a grim reminder.
We lived in fear of the Titans,
disgraced to cower within the cages we called Walls.
Eren!
Eren?
Let us pray for our three goddesses: Maria, Rose, and Sina.
For their continued well-being...
And for our peace and safety...
You must not doubt the sacred Walls!
These gleaming Walls, bequeathed to us by God,
will grow ever stronger through our faith and devotion.
An innocent heart, wholly devoted to God,
offers our only protection from the Titans!
Our only hope of keeping them at bay
A Titan?
How'd it get here?
No!
Stay away from the Walls!
Our Walls!
It seems like he's retaining control this time.
Indeed.
Even so, Eren's never been able to defeat the Female-form Titan.
Since he chose to transform, I think he's ready to fight her for real.
He won't go down so easily
Willpower alone cannot win battles!
You should know that, Jean!
Defeating Annie will require much more...
An open area!
The Female-form Titan's headed out into the open!
We can't use 3D Maneuver Gear there!
Split up and make your way around to the far side!
Roger!
C'mon! Hurry up! Faster!
This makes no sense
What's a Titan doing here?
Annie...
You always acted like the rest of the world was unbearably stupid.
You always looked bored.
But every once in a while, you'd come alive...
When you showed off your martial arts.
You said such skills were pointless in this era,
but I could tell that deep down, you didn't believe that.
But I just figured you were a shitty liar...
Tell me, Annie...
What are you even fighting for?
What could be worth the lives of all those people?!
What on Earth?
Squad Leader,
even if we do capture the Female-form Titan,
the whole city might be destroyed first!
We're doing it regardless.
Erwin's decision is final.
Be ready to capture her.
Yes, ma'am.
Eren...
Nobody told me anything about this...
Why are there Titans fighting here?
What's going on?
Titans fighting each other?
Correct.
The city has sustained massive damage.
Casualties are mounting, both civilian and military.
Erwin! Was this your plan all along?!
That's right.
All of this was my personal decision.
I have no intention of making excuses.
You must've known what would happen
if you executed such an operation within the city!
So why? Why would you still do it?
For the sake of mankind,
to lead us to victory.
Bullshit!
You're a traitor!
If I executed you now, none of the higher-ups would even give a shit!
Fine by me.
However, you'll need to assume command.
The Female-form Titan must not escape.
Paehl's in charge of formations.
Vyler oversees supplies.
Coordinate with them, and push her to the eastern Wall at all costs.
H-Hey.. Hold on!
Are you...
Are you seriously saying that
this will be to mankind's advantage?
I believe it's the next step for us.
Lower your rifles, men.
Handcuff him!
Yes, sir.
Deploy all of our men.
Your priority is the rescue and evacuation of civilians!
Yes, sir!
Erwin, your punishment will be decided in court.
After this is finished, I'll gladly stand trial.
Levi, you stay here.
You dislike pointless death.
You're right. I hate it.
It's truly loathsome, no matter who dies.
If you're not willing to make sacrifices yourself,
you'll never be able to change anything!
In order to overcome monsters, you must be willing
to abandon your own humanity.
That's certainly something Annie can do.
Annie...
Annie!
Annie...
Your daddy's the only one left on your side.
I will...
kill the Titans...
Every single fucking one of them!
Eren!
That's...
Eren!
Don't!
Right now, we're not certain if Eren can recognize you...
H-Hey...
Hey!
The Wall!
Is she going to climb over it?!
No!
She's going to get away!
I won't allow it!
Annie...
Fall.
Annie...
I was wrong.
It's too late to ask your forgiveness.
But...
There's one thing...
I want to ask of you.
You can make an enemy of the entire world...
I'll destroy this whole fucking world!
But even if the entire world hates you,
your dad will still be on your side.
Oh, shit... He'll eat that girl inside too!
Eren, don't!
Eren!
I am free...
So promise me...
What happened?
What the hell?!
Are they fusing?!
Eren!
Don't eat our only witness, you moron.
Eren...
Mikasa?
Where's Annie?
Dammit...
What the fuck?!
We've come this far, and you still won't say a word, Annie?!
Come out!
Come out and finish what you started!
Hey, this isn't fair! Annie! Annie!
Stop it.
It's useless.
Use the cables to make a net!
We'll wrap it up and carry it underground.
Yes, sir.
If we can't get any intel from Annie, what do we have to show for all this?
We caused so many deaths.
And yet, despite all the lives we've lost, so many mysteries yet remain.
What have we accomplished?
I don't suppose we can call this operation a success...
No.
Though we've ensured the continued survival of the Recon Corps,
if just by the skin of our teeth.
I hope so.
Erwin...
I have several questions about this operation of yours.
If you'd identified a suspect,
why didn't you request help from the Military Police?
Governor, I reasoned
that the Female-form Titan likely had allies,
so I had to limit the operation to just those I knew weren't involved.
But what of all the damage caused to Stohess?
Even our best efforts were not enough.
You have our sincere apologies.
Do you think apologies are enough?!
If we'd left her alone,
the Walls would have been destroyed, and far more would have died.
I see.
After all the deaths resulting from this operation,
do you have any proof that it actually forestalled mankind's extinction?
I can't imagine that Annie Leonhart
will be giving us any intel now.
No, that seems unlikely.
In other words... This was all for nothing?
Eren...
Are you feeling better?
Yeah.
It's almost creepy how quickly I recovered.
I heard that Annie's still frozen.
Yeah.
Damn...
We got nothing out of that entire operation!
I can't believe how far she'd go to prevent us from getting any intel.
Yeah, she got away from us.
Eren's the one who let it happen.
Isn't that right, Eren?
You hesitated for an instant...
Yeah,
you're right, Armin.
I couldn't do it.
When I saw Annie, I froze up.
Armin Arlert.
Jean Kirstein.
It's your turn to be questioned.
Yes, sir.
They're starting with us?
Well, see you later.
Yeah...
At the time, it actually felt good...
Even getting the shit beat out of me.
I even thought I wouldn't mind dying.
Eren!
I don't feel like that now.
I'm just thankful...
I can't really understand it at all.
Abandoning your humanity to overcome monsters.
That's the only way to win?
It's one possible way that mankind could defeat the Titans.
I think Eren can do it.
Tell me...
Even if he became that monster, even if he destroyed all the Titans...
Would that really be a victory for mankind?
Eat.
It won't be easy to overcome...
However, I believe we have gained a tremendous opportunity
to ensure the survival of mankind.
Considering how recently it was unimaginable to us that humans could transform into Titans,
the mere fact that we've captured one of the enemy is a giant leap forward.
Indeed, they're out there.
We'll track them all down...
Every last Titan within the Walls.
It's our turn to attack now!
The royal summons for the Recon Corps and Eren Jaeger was suspended indefinitely.
Custody of Annie Leonhart was also granted to the Recon Corps,
who stored her deep underground.
However,
much more time and sacrifice
would still be required before mankind learned
what it was that truly held them captive...
Wall
Raid on Stohess District (pt 3)
O, my friend!
This is a victory for us!
Our fame starts here!
O, my friend!
Let us celebrate this victory for the next battle!
I died for naught I won't let it end like that for you
until I am the last one standing
The enemy is cruel... We will kill
The enemy is colossal... We will jump
In our hands we hold blades of glory
and sing in the name of victory
We bear the wings of freedom on our backs
Swearing iron determination upon our hearts,
we slash apart the circle of idiocy
and soar through the sky
with our wings of freedom
O mein Freund!
Jetzt, hier ist ein Sieg
Dies ist der erste Gloria
O mein Freund!
Feiern wir diesen Sieg fur den nachsten Kampf
OUD...
Der Feind ist grausam... Wir bringen...
Der Feind ist riesig... Wir springen...
Gloria
O Sieg

If we suppose that I am not me,
Can you say with certainty that you are you?
Will you be able to pick up after yourself
Once your sand-like shell breaks and your heart crumbles?
I could hear someone calling
But now my ears are just ringing
It's as if time has frozen
Now, wake up
I began to walk through a deep dark abyss
As swift as a gale, I escaped for my life
I felt like a living corpse
We break out of our walls
To reunite in worlds we've yet to map
