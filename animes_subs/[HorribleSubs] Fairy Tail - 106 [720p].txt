Lisanna was good friends with Natsu since they were children,
but during one incident, it was thought that she died.
We eventually overcame our sadness and somehow moved on...
But then we were reunited with Lisanna in Edolas.
And moreover, she was really our Lisanna!
Natsu and the others were tackling the S Class Wizard Advancement Exam
when the powerful Dark Guild, Grimoire Heart, appeared before them.
While the Fairy Tail wizards were fighting a desperate battle
against the Lost Magic-wielding Seven Kin of Purgatory,
Makarov was defeated by Master Hades.
I will never forgive you!
Don't underestimate the power... of family!!
Somehow, Natsu beat the God Slayer, Zancrow. However...
The World of Great Magic.
I-Impossible...
Some wannabe dragon hunter... beat me?
Inside the enemy's magic power, he emptied out his own magic...
And he created a new vessel which lets him eat flames he couldn't eat before!
What manner of man is he...?
I'll have to give him a good scolding for this later...
Gramps...
Let's fight.
I know there are times when you have to fall back.
Gildarts taught me that.
But this ain't one of those times.
These bastards chose Fairy Tail as their enemy.
So we have to make them realize...
Let's fight...
Gr-Gr...
Natsu!
The power of family?
I thought you were going to show that to me.
Mira-nee! Use Satan Soul!
Satan Soul?
That's not magic I can use repeatedly.
Sisters?
Fairy Tail's Fairy Sisters...
Then... could it be...?
Are you the Demon Mirajane?!
That was a long time ago.
When Mira-nee gets serious, she's mega-strong!
I see... Well, I would like to have a bout with a serious demon.
What's wrong? You can't take this seriously?
My magic is more than enough to take you down!
No, Lisanna!
I want you to get away!
This man... is extremely strong.
I would really rather not do this, but...
What is this?!
Lisanna!
In three minutes, that will explode.
Hold it. I wouldn't put any more pressure on it if I were you.
If you want to set her free, you'll have to defeat me.
I can't... get free!
You fiend!
I'll do anything in order to fight that demon.
Mira-nee!
It doesn't feel like my magic power will last long...
This is it! This sensation!
Wonderful!
Mira-nee!
Don't worry about me! Just focus!
Chain Burst!
You're strong...
Let Lisanna go!
I knew you'd be strong!
I haven't felt this high in a long time!
What are you looking at?!
Burst Claw!
Mira-nee!
Evil Explosion!
I knew this would be good...
Let's have more fun, Mirajane!
No good... He's too strong!
If my magic power wasn't depleted...
Mira-nee!
What do you think you're doing?!
Pointless!
The only way to stop the countdown is by beating me!
Come on! There's no time!
Show me your true strength!
I'm sorry...
It's frustrating, but I don't have enough magic power left to take him down.
Right now, that's impossible for me.
Mira-nee...
But I have faith...
I have faith that someone in the guild can beat him...
What are you... saying, Mira-nee?
So I'm... giving up...
I won't let you die again.
Mira... nee...
Mira-nee!
No!
Come on, wake up!
Mira-nee!
Mira-nee!!!
The path to Zeref...
Too long for me...
But today, finally, my dream will come true.
Once I have Zeref in my hands, I'll be saved.
Who's there?!
Are you looking for me?
I see... You people are the seeds of conflict.
It's so sad...
Are you okay, Wendy?
I'm fine. But why won't my healing magic work on these two?
It looks like the Master's wounds are too deep.
With these injuries, no matter how much Sky Magic you use...
What about Natsu?
I don't know why it doesn't work on Natsu.
The only thing I can think of is that something is blocking the treatment.
Natsu... Master...
Wendy...
Master!
You found us...?
Yes!
Don't worry... about me...
Take care... of Natsu...
No! I promise! I promise that I'll do something!
I promise that I'll help you both!
Natsu's... scarf...
Can you put it back... to the way it was?
His scarf?
The malevolence that stains his scarf... is impeding Natsu's recovery...
I'll try!
Why did Natsu's scarf become black in the first place?
That creepy guy with black hair I was telling you about did it.
Could that be...
Zeref!
After all that searching, here you are...
You people want my power?
We desire your entire existence, Lord Zeref.
I have no intention of doing anything in this age.
I don't want to see strife or anyone die.
Cease your attacks upon this island and leave at once!
He doesn't want to see strife or anyone die?
Though he's conscious, he doesn't know who he is?
This is Zeref?!
He's in a state of slumber?!
I'm angry!
What is that monster?!
Look who's talking!
This is my Sacred Guardian Beast, Thunderclap Belcusas.
Thunderclap Belcusas...
It's even got two names?!
The encounter between demon and angel is unavoidable destiny.
I don't know anything about angels or demons,
but if you're a Man, fight me fair and square!
Belcusas, fight them fair and square.
I meant you!
Fairy Machine Gun! Leprechaun!
It has no effect?!
Take Over, Beast Soul!
What are you doing?!
All you have to do is turn him to stone, right?!
That only works on humans!
Idiot! I meant the boss! That man!
I can't! He's wearing glasses!
Jeez! You're utterly useless!
Do you wanna be turned to stone first?!
When two people who love each other disagree, that's...
We don't love each other!
You stop that thing!
Evergreen!
I've seen through to the true nature of his magic!
It's the same as Lucy, Summoning Magic!
And the weakness of those who use Summoning Magic is clear!
Their own body is weak!
You're mine!
I'm the King of the Underworld.
This arm is an ebony sword that cuts through everything!
Scatter across the darkness!
Evergreen!
W-What is that magic?!
I could explain it to trash, but it would be difficult to comprehend.
For trash...
What's that?!
It's magic that has gotten too close to the abyss of the magic path.
And because of that, this magic has a powerful side effect...
Oh, what a catastrophic fate...
But when we get our hands on Zeref,
that catastrophe will be over and an age of new magic will come.
He's the one from before...
Zeref?!
The legendary black magic wizard?!
That man was him?!
I mean... Zeref is on this island right now?!
The World of Great Magic.
The World of Great Magic?! What is that?!
A world of magic governed by chaos and darkness.
What is that?!
It's a place where those without magic cannot live.
Or even if they can, it's a living hell...
Sounds wonderful, doesn't it?! A world just for us!
Garbage who can't use magic won't exist there!
When Zeref becomes the king of this world...
Those without magic power will all cease to exist!
It'll be a paradise for wizards only!
I've been waiting for this age!
I've been waiting forever!!
I-I don't believe it...
It... It can't be!
What is that?
It's gone...
At this rate, I'll be next...
But getting injured to some extent
is to be expected in the course of catching Zeref.
Lost Magic!
Time Ark!
I'll manipulate the time of those physical objects and capture Lord Zeref!
There!
It's coming...
The Predator of Death...
Time Ark!
What are you?!
Luminous Nimitz!
Legendary wizard or not, when your true self is sleeping,
you're no match for me.
Don't make light of the leader of the Seven Kin of Purgatory!
But it'll be okay, Lord Zeref...
Don't...
I got him...
I have Zeref!
We're scattered all over the island, but I hope everyone's okay...
I'm sure Erza and Gray are fine.
And Lucy is tough when it comes down to the crunch...
I'm worried about Elfman.
Yeah, he screws up during critical moments...
And I'm anxious about him being partners with Evergreen, too.
Everyone from the Raijinshuu has eccentric personalities.
Next time: Ark of Embodiment.
But you never know. Two oddballs might actually work well together...
They lllike each other!
Oh, I haven't heard that in a while!
