Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
Konpaku, Mod Souls
were fake souls created to battle Hollows.
However, the project was abandoned as inhumane
and the order was given to destroy all of the Mod Souls, but
Urahara Store
Well, I guess that's it.
UmMr. Kisuke
Hmm?
Uh I'm sorry This is all my fault
You're angry aren't you?
Huh?
Not at all. Why are you getting so scared?
We're in this together, aren't we?
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.
Mr. Kisuke
Now, now There, there
Manager, everything is ready.
All right. Shall we go to collect our merchandise then?
Yes. Okay.
Uhthat guy What's he doing all by himself?
If I stay calm, I can easily read your moves!
Damn!
Come back, you!
Wait, Ichigo!
We have an order!
What?! At a time like this?!
A Hollow is about to appear!
It's near!
Oh, damn!
Let's go!
Teacher!
Hashigami! Kaneda! Ino!
What are you yelling about?
A strange high school student attacked us!
He had orange hair
A high school student?
Huh?
Oh!
What can this be?
I think you boys play too many video games.
Damn
That Soul Reaper and those kids ruined my good mood
Damn!
Oh!
A Hollow! I sense a Hollow
It's around where I was
Is it going to attack those kids?
Kill him off.
--
So what? I'll make a better one.
Why should we do this? Why doesn't she believe us?
Probably because we're always misbehaving.
That's right.
And she even confiscated our games.
What's wrong?!
My Soul Pager isn't working right.
What?!
Is the battery dead?
What're you talking about?!
You should have bought some spare batteries instead of pining after a Chappie!
I can't figure out the location of the Hollow.
Damn!
W-What was that?
I-It's that high school student!
W-What's that?!
Blood?!
What's that?
That's it!
Okay!
Huh?!
That's
That idiot!
Huh? Hey, Ichigo!
You interfere with my meal, then you run all over the place.
I don't know who you are,
but you're not strong enough to be messing with me!
Exactly!
Oh!
Y-You Why
are you helping me
You! You're hurt!
Whose body do you think this is?!
If a two-bit one like this can bloody you up this bad,
don't even think about fighting!
What do you mean?!
I had to fight it because you took so long getting here!
Shut up! You're supposed to be a battle-ready Mod Soul!
How pitiful!
What's with you two?!
Shut up!!
Hey! What's wrong?!
You idiot! How reckless can you be?!
Once you crack its head, the Hollow will disappear on its own!
And you had to...
go kick it again. There's no one here.
Are you boys pulling my leg?
No! It's true! You have to believe us!
Then, where is this bleeding high school student?
But it's true Right?
All right. I want you to stay and clean after school again tomorrow, okay?
What?! Wait a minute!
Teacher!
Didn't you hate them?
So what? If I didn't help them, they would've been killed.
And I won't let anyone get killed.
Soon after I was created,
the Soul Society ordered all Mod Souls be destroyed.
In other words...
my date of death was determined the day after I was created.
I trembled in fear every day, inside that pill,
as I watched the others around me disappear, day by day.
Even though I was able to slip out of the warehouse
by hiding among other pills,
I was always afraid that I would someday be discovered and destroyed.
Why should others determine my fate?
Why? Why can't I decide for myself?!
Isn't it up to me whether I live or die?!
That's why
That's why Iwon't kill anyone
And I don't want to see anyone killed.
Oh, my Here I finally found you and you're all battered up.
Looks like all the equipment we prepared was for nothing.
Huh?!
Huh?
Wha-!
Collection completed.
Let's go home, everyone.
What?!
But I thought I'd finally be able to fight it out, after all this time.
W-Wait
Wait a minute!
What are you going to do with that?
Do with it?
Destroy it.
Y-You can see me? Who are you guys?
Well, how can I answer that?
A greedy merchant.
Hey, you can't take that!
What's this, Urahara?
Do you take back goods you've sold to people without giving them a refund?
Oh, well, I guess I'll refund you then.
That's not necessary. I'm satisfied with this item.
Besides, you guys work outside the laws of the Soul Society.
You're not really obligated to collect these things, are you?
Don't blame me if you run into trouble.
We're going to be hiding out.
Don't worry. I've gotten used to trouble lately.
Here
Let's go home.
Uh, okay
Hm? What's the matter, Ichigo?
Man Abusing my body, knowing it wasn't his
Hey, I'm talking to you!
Are you listening?!
You must look very strange to outsiders.
I don't like it!
Rukia, what do I do to complain to him directly?
Hm? Well, you'd need to insert it into a body without a soul
in other words, a dead body.
Got it! A dead body!
Let's see now
I'm not going to find one lying around!
Quit yapping.
Huh?
This is
Hey
In other words, all I need is a receptacle, right?
Huh? Yes, but that's not
Oh, but this body I'm in isn't a real body either
Rukia
Please pardon the inconvenience during the construction.  O-Okay, let's give it a try.
You sure? So, what do I do?
You put it into its mouth, I guess
Okaylike this?
Humph. It didn't work.
Looks like it.
That hurts, you idiot!
You! Ichigo Kurosaki!
I challenge you again!
Huh, what? Y-You're huge!
No, I'm small! What's going on?!
My hands have gotten so cute!
Ohh I'm all soft!
Hey you, Mod Soul!
Huh?
I don't think our discussion was over!
Let me go!
I'm gonna take real good care of you! Prepare yourself!
Then I guess I'll take you on as I am!
Hey! Wake up, Ichigo! It's morning!
Morning! Morning!
How's that? Give up?
If you give up, then wake up and apologize!
If you don't, I'll get in your school bag and follow you to school.
The girls in your class will say,
Oh, Kurosaki you carry a stuffed animal around? How weird!
Ow! Let go of me, you! Oh!
Yammering away first thing in the morning
I told you to shut up and act like a stuffed animal, didn't I, Kon?!
Why the heck are you calling me Kon?!
It's hard to call you Kaizo Konpaku.
Kon's good enough for you.
That's no reason for you to call me Kon!
Doesn't it sound sort of silly?
I know! Why don't you call me Kai, instead?
I like Kai. Call me Kai.
No way. Why not?!
Because Kai sounds kinda cool. I wouldn't like it.
Damn you
Don't get smart! You
What's all this racket, so early in the morning?
I can't even take my time changing clothes
Huh?
Huh?
N-Nice angle I'm glad I'm a stuffed animal
Ow! Stop it! Stop it! My stuffing's coming out! My stuffing!
Ichigo, I'm coming in.
Kojima and Asano are
Huh?
What are you doing?
N-N-Nothing. I'm not doing anything.
What are you doing, so early in the morning?
It isn't early anymore.
Kojima and Asano are waiting for you.
What?!
Oh! It's this late already?! Ohhh! I'm going to be late!
Your toast is ready, so eat before you go.
Sorry! I overslept!
I'll be right out, so wait for me!
Hey, this is unusual!
Well, take your time, but hurry, okay?
Sure!
Say
What is it?
You erased the memories of my classmates again, didn't you?
Of course.
You wouldn't want them to remember what happened yesterday, would you?
Well I guess not.
Too many things have been happening.
and it's like
it's only natural
Ichigo, I'm going on ahead.
Ichigo?
What's wrong?
Nothing
Ichigo
Say, Tatsuki, your elective was art, right?
Huh? Yeah.
Did you do your assignment, Me in the Future?
Yes, I did. Why?
Let's show each other what we've done.
I have no confidence at all.
Sure.
Here!
Wow, you're good!
I'm going to be the female vale tudo champion someday!
This is so nice.
Mine is too awful to show you.
What about you, Orihime? What did you draw?
Thanks for asking!
Actually, in my heart, I call it my masterpiece!
Oh really? Show me.
Ta-da!
The Future Me  Maximum speed: 380 kph!
From my mouth, flames of 20,000 degrees Celsius,
and from my eyes, special destructive rays!
No, Orihime! That's definitely not what you were supposed to draw!
Huh? What? Why? Do you want to get detention again?
But wait, there's more
Oh!
Good morning, Ichigo!
Huh? Oh!
Oh, good morning, Inoue!
What's with him?
He's sure in a good mood today.
Isn't he, Orihime? Huh? Orihime?
Mmm But
Michiru, what's the date today?
Huh? It's June 16
I see
He's not in a good mood.
He acts like that when he's really tense.
Oh
Tatsuki?
Don't worry I know the reason why.
Tomorrow, he's going to skip school.
Ta-da! And now,
Kurasaki Clinic will be closed tomorrow on the 17th.  I would like to  discuss our duties for tomorrow!
And since, as your father,
I am the chairman, I get to make all of the decisions!
What do you mean? You can't call this a discussion!
Hey! Raise your hand if you want to speak, Chief of Staff!
C-Chief of Staff?
Not exactly unhappy
Yuzu will be the lunch staff officer, as usual.
Aye aye, sir!
Karin will be the porter!
Huh?! What happened to Chief of Staff?
Oh, I just had my hair cut. What do you think of it?
Don't come near me! Stop it! Come on. Take a look!
It looked like fun.
What was?
What? The family meeting you had, of course.
So, what? Are you playing hooky from school and going on a picnic tomorrow?
A picnic?! That sounds good!
Say, Rukia Huh?
About my job as Soul Reaper
Can I take the day off tomorrow?
Wha-? What are you saying?!
Of course, you can't! What's going on with you?!
You've been acting strange since this morning.
It's the day she died
Tomorrow's the anniversary of the day my mom died.
That's not quite right
To be precise, it's not the day she died
it's the day she was killed.
Oh! Good morning, Inoue!
Tomorrow, he's going to skip school.
If If I were the rain
would I be able to connect with someone's heart,
the way the rain connects the never-intersecting sky and earth?
Huh?!
Yay! Yay! Go!
Go! Go!
Shucks
Yay! We did it!
Okay, one more time!
I won't lose this time!
What's the matter, mister?
Sorry, something just came up.
Aww no
Here you go.
Yay!
So, who is it today?
The thirteenth division's Rukia Kuchiki.
Kuchiki?
And what has that young lady done?
She has stayed too long in the human world.
Is that all?
We wouldn't call you out if that were all
There's something behind it. Find out what it is.
I can be a little rough, I take it?
Leave at once.
That Rukia Kuchiki
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Next! Amazing suspense!
