One and two!
Muscles, muscles!
One and two!
Muscles, muscles!
Hey, I've been thinking...
Yeah?
All we've been doing recently is practice.
Do you think my arms'll get big and totally ripped?
Don't worry.
I don't think you've been practicing that much in the first place.
Now, now. You're supposed to put in effort when people aren't watching.
But you don't.
Well, don't worry about it.
Komari-kun puts in lots of extra effort, but she's still soft and squishy.
Soft and squishy!
Soft and squishy...
And to keep your sexy figure, you need muscle.
Particularly, your abs, dorsals, and pecs.
I see...
Soft and squishy!
You really are soft and squishy.
I wonder if Rin-kun is too.
Rin-chan, wait!
Soft and squishy!
Wafu!
No!
Hey, could you tell me your training routine?
Muscles, muscles!
Huh?
Just for reference.
Sure.
I start with an easy...
1000 squats!
Like I could do 1000 squats, you musclehead!
I'm being nice and teaching you, here!
Got you!
Soft and squishy!
Soft and squishy!
Stop it, you guys!
Soft and squishy!
Soft and squishy!
Ah, how cute!
Soft and squishy!
And that's why...
What's why?
My fellow Little Busters.
Our first match is coming up soon.
We'll be picking up the pace during practice to prepare for it.
I want you guys to be careful not to get hurt.
Listen Kyousuke, there's something we need before we can play a match.
What's that?
I see. So you don't know.
I'll just have to tell you.
A full team!
We don't have Kengo! It's just you, Riki, me,
Rin, Komari, Kurugaya, Saigusa, Kud-o, and Rin!
In total, that's... Wait, that's nine.
Huh? You counted me twice.
Is there a second me somewhere?
I'm sure it's just psychological.
Don't try looking for her in reality.
I just messed up counting!
I'm sorry!
So basically, we only have eight members at the moment.
We'll find one more somehow.
Somehow?
Who's going to make that happen?
Isn't that obvious?
Riki, you're honest and good with people.
You're the best we've got for recruiting members.
Agreed!
We won't have to worry if we leave it to you!
You can do it, Riki-kun!
Go get us one more.
I knew this would happen.
That's definitely a foul.
Amazing...
Ball down! Ball down!
That one's going MIA for sure.
No, I don't think so.
I'll go look for it.
Guess it wouldn't hurt to ask.
Nishizono-san, sorry!
That must've hurt!
I'm really sorry!
Naoe-san, my parasol.
Would you mind picking it up for me?
Thank you very much.
It's nothing. Are you hurt?
Not particularly.
But I may have a bruise.
I was struck by a ball in the same spot just a few minutes ago.
A ball?
I thought the baseball team had been suspended.
I wonder who's playing now.
I wish they would concern themselves with others' safety.
Um...
Yes?
Hey, Riki! Did you find the ball yet?
We came to help you!
Oh, you found it?
What're you still doing here?
Um... So... I'm sorry.
Perhaps we can work on your execution.
Execution?
You mean how I apologize?
In this case, capital punishment.
Capital punishment?!
That was a joke.
I-I see. Thank goodness.
I don't mind it at all.
So you shouldn't mind me either.
Come on.
Let's go. Back to practice.
Nishizono-san looked really lonely to me.
Rise!
Bow!
Huh? Where's Nishizono-san?
Class just ended too...
Out there again?
And now I'm alone.
Oh, I'm sorry! I made the birds fly away!
Sorry.
That's okay.
Did you need something?
Did you end up getting a bruise?
I brought these just in case.
You brought me compresses?
They might not be useful the day after, though.
You're the type that likes to look after people.
You haven't eaten lunch?
Yeah.
Because you were looking for me?
That might be one reason.
If you'd like, you may have these.
Bread crusts.
Bread crusts?
I brought them to feed the birds.
I made sandwiches today, but I don't eat the crusts.
You make your own lunch?
I don't think you'll like them.
No, no. I like bread crusts.
So you like birds, Nishizono-san?
I do too.
They fly free through the sky, without a soul to stop them.
I don't like birds.
They always fly away without a word to me.
But so long as they're eating, they don't fly.
I feed them to bind them to the earth.
Ungrateful, aren't they?
I feed them every day.
You can't bind something with wings to the earth.
It's nothing but futile resistance.
But don't you think it's better to resist than not?
I've been rambling.
Forget I said anything.
Nishizono-san is always under her parasol.
On mild spring days,
on sweltering summer days,
on chilly autumn days,
and on winter days that make you shiver.
Some say her skin is sensitive, but no one really knows why.
I'd never noticed until now,
but Nishizono-san always sits under that tree, eating lunch and reading a book.
I'd never even noticed that she wasn't in the classroom.
I don't think it's just me.
No one notices her presence, like a rock on the side of the road.
No one knows where she is or what she's doing.
I've never seen Nishizono-san talking to anyone.
It's like she doesn't have a shadow.
You don't know if she's around.
Shadowless.
Shadowless.
Shadowless, huh?
Now that's mean.
Nishizono-san is always watching the world from under her parasol alone.
I think I might've been looking at the world the same way.
If you guys hadn't been there for me...
Maybe I could do for her what Kyousuke did for me.
I'm going to invite her to join the Little Busters.
Sure. Go get her, Riki.
Nishizono-san.
I don't have any bread crusts for you today.
I see.
But I do have these.
If you're okay with leftovers.
Can I have them?
Go ahead.
Thanks.
So you made onigiri today?
No.
They look like onigiri to me...
No. They're omusubi.
Aren't those the same thing?
They're completely different.
Rice balls shaped into triangles are onigiri.
Rice balls kept round are omusubi.
I see. So triangles are onigiri and round ones are omusubi.
But these are triangles...
It might be the other way around.
Triangles are...
Round ones are...
We needn't worry about minor details.
You're right.
You were reading that book yesterday, and the day before too.
What book is it?
Are you curious?
Just a little.
I like books.
This book is particularly important to me.
My very self is written in it.
That's how important it is to me.
Sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.
These are good.
That's rude.
You shouldn't speak with your mouth full.
Didn't your parents teach you that?
I don't have parents.
I wasn't aware, but that was insensitive of me.
No, it's okay.
I've got the Little Busters.
Little Busters?
What's that?
Uh... My friends.
Heroes who vanquish evil and deliver justice.
Though all we do is play baseball now.
And these heroes struck me with a ball?
I'm really sorry about that.
Nishizono-san, would you like to play baseball with us?
Baseball?
When I made friends with the others,
a whole world that I'd never even imagined opened up to me.
I found a place where I belonged.
A place where I could be myself, no matter what.
I thought maybe you'd like to join us.
That does sound interesting.
However...
Did you know that I don't participate in gym class?
Thank you for the invitation, but I must respectfully decline.
Do you have some sort of condition?
You're always under that parasol...
Ask me again some other time.
If I trust you well enough, I'll tell you.
Though I don't think that time will come.
Fifth period is gym.
We should hurry.
While I don't participate, I'm required to change.
Goodbye.
Let's go!
Hold it! Muscles coming through!
Just get changed already, Masato.
What's wrong?
No confidence in your muscles?
No, I just forgot my tracksuit in our classroom.
Our classroom?
The girls are changing there right now.
Yeah, so you guys go on ahead.
Come on, don't give me such a sad look.
Kengo, could you take this big lug with you?
You've got to be kidding.
Like I'd ever go with you!
He forgot something in there.
Oh?
I'm telling you, I saw it!
No way!
Yui-chan!
Hurry up!
Yes...
But stop calling me that.
Yui-chan?
I said stop.
Boy.
Y-You almost gave me a heart attack.
I have a request for you.
Miss Nishizono is searching for a book.
It seems she lost an important book.
You mean that book?
You should help her search.
Huh?
This matter doesn't concern Naoe-san.
No, I'll help.
I figured you'd agree.
I'll pet you gently later.
No, you don't have to...
Bye, then.
Good luck.
What?! Kurugaya-san!
You put that book back in your bag before fifth period, right?
Yes.
Before I changed into my gym uniform, I took the book out of my bag.
I put it on top of this desk.
But when I came back from gym, I couldn't find it.
A book can't just sprout legs and walk off.
Maybe someone took it deliberately?
I shouldn't suspect my own classmates without any evidence, but...
Naoe-san, it's alright.
We don't even know where to look.
Let's just look for it a bit more.
I'll just purchase another copy.
Only the words written inside hold significance.
I've read the book enough times to recite it by heart.
Losing the book itself is no matter to me.
But finding the book is a good thing.
Even if someone hid it from me on purpose?
Even if learning the truth places an unnecessary burden on me?
Do you think you should search for the book under such circumstances?
There are people in this world who don't understand
that what they consider a harmless prank can deeply hurt someone else.
Did you know that?
Do you know what people in our class call me?
There is evil in this world.
Shadowless.
Shadowless.
I believe that, just like you.
But I also believe that there's just as much good in this world.
Let's try searching for it again.
Kurugaya-san?
The following is a deduction.
Miss Nishizono accidentally knocked the book off her desk as she changed.
Someone picked it up.
One of the three people who took longer than Miss Nishizono to change and leave the classroom.
A shy girl who couldn't ask whose book it was.
She put the book into her own desk, thinking to ask whose book it was later, only to miss her opportunity.
I have located the girl most likely to match this description.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was your book.
Thank you.
Isn't that great?
Yes.
That was quite the deduction, Kurugaya-san.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
Thank you very much as well, Naoe-san.
Could I ask you something?
Yes?
What book is that?
You're shameless.
You chose to ask me when you knew I couldn't refuse.
Take a look.
Are you sure?
I'm not so cruel as to say no at this point.
Thanks.
Poems by Wakayama Bokusui?
Does not a white bird
Feel within her heart forlorn?
The blue of the sky,
The blue of the sea. Neither
Stains her; between them she floats.
I saw blue.
A vast, never-ending blue.
And a single, lonesome bird floating in it.
I don't really know how to say it.
It's a sad poem.
I don't think it's a sad poem.
A bird unstained by any blue.
This poem is full of hope.
That's how I see it.
Oh, you're here.
It's time for practice!
Come on, come on!
Are you going to play baseball now?
Yeah. Come by to watch sometime.
Just once is fine.
It's fun.
Just come on down.
Um...
Would you mind if I watched you play baseball today?
There!
Wafu!
I had a feeling that something was about to start.
A test of courage!
A page in the books of our youth!
A mysterious ghost in the school at night!
Wafu!
A ghost, a ghost, a ghost!
Something's going to happen!
Mission, start!
