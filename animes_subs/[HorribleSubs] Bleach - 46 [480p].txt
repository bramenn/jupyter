Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Follow me, Izuru.
See you later, then.
Shiro-chan.
Dont call me Shiro-chan” and dont pat me on the head!
When you get into the same school as me,
Ill call you by your last name.
Forget it! Who wants to join a school for Soul Reapers?
Ill come home from the dorm to visit, okay?
See you!
Dont come back, Bedwetter Momo.
Kagekiyo and Shizuka Kira”
Ill be going now, Father and Mother.
Rats! Were gonna be late!
Its your fault!
Sleeping in a tree! I was looking for you all over!
Shut up! Its none of your business where I sleep!
Agh! I shouldve left without you!
Our Soul Reaper Academy is a school of proud tradition that builds
the Stealth Force and the Thirteen Court Guard Squads of the future!
I ask that you apply yourselves diligently and uphold the pride of our school!
I am your instructor
Gengoro Ounabara.
This Freshman Class One took the top scores in the entrance exam.
In other words, you are in the advanced class!
Rather than merely serve your future squads,
train hard to excel in your various pursuits!
Excellence isnt limited to the advanced class!
If you train just as hard as they do, you too, could be just as good,
That Renji. How impudent
if not better.
Group 1, step forward.
Yes, sir!
Hado exercises! Begin!
Yes, sir!
Ruler!
Mask of flesh and blood, all things in the universe fly!

Beyond the seas in reverse, take steps to the South.

It was still great.
Others couldnt even reach it!

Wow, amazing! He hit it dead center!
Huhh Hes pretty good.
I didnt know there was a guy like that in my class
Next, Group 3!

You seem quite tired.

Uhsure
Your blows left me flabbergasted.
I was overwhelmed by your power, and I couldnt counterattack.
My arms still numb.
Ah, sorry. I didnt mean anything by it.
I messed up during the Hado practice, so I wanted to make up for it.
Zan Ken So Ki”
We must master each discipline in order to become Soul Reapers.
Our works cut out for us, isnt it?

Huh?
Uh, whats happening?
Huh? Oh, the captain of a Court Guard Squad is visiting us.
What? A captain?!
Wow!

Anyhow, the captain is amazing!
The Spiritual Pressure surrounding his body
is totally different from ours!
Hey, are you listening, Shiro-chan?!
Quit calling me Shiro-chan, I said!
Why come home on every day off, anyway?
Do you have that much free time at the Soul Reaper school?
But I came home just to visit you!
I never asked you to.
When I become a Soul Reaper, Im going to join Captain Aizens Squad 5!
Hey! Im serious about this!
Hey!
Wh-Whats the big idea, Renji?!
Whatre you daydreaming about?
Six months, and you still aint adjusted to school, yet?
Thats a big load.
Do you have field training today?
Yeah! Were gonna practice fighting dummy Hollows in the World of the Living.
Wha?! No fair!
How come its only your class?!
Besides, why should only you be in Class 1?!
It is fair! Its ability! Real ability!
Grr
So long! Im gonna come back way better than you!
Look forward to it!
Moron! Im gonna be way

First, a short introduction.
Im a 6th grade student, Hisagi.
Im Kanizawa.
Im Aoga.
We three will guide you.
What? Are those upperclassmen famous?
Dont you know?
Not all of them, just the one in the middle.
Shuhei Hisagi.
He is assured of a post in the Court Guard before graduation,
which hasnt happened in the last few years.
They say hes even certain to get a Seat Officer post.
By the way, he failed the academys entrance exam twice.
So I might be better in terms of talent
since I got the highest score for it.
Now well break up into groups of threes.
Look at the lots you drew earlier
and find your teammates with the same mark.
So thats what these were for
Whos our third teammate, though?
Uhexcuse me
Hello, you two.
Oh, its you, Hinamori
Hello there.
Okay, so youve formed your groups?
Well explain todays exercise.
6th grade students have already entered the World of the Living
and built a barrier around a suitable area.
You are to engage in practice combat
with dummy Hollows within that perimeter.
The 6th grade students will create a combat-ready environment,
but they wont assist you in the combat itself.
Got that? Fine. Lets go!
Its begun!
Maintain barrier strength!
During practice, its common for the real thing to attack!
Right! This is a safe zone, though.
This is part of our own training, too. Dont let your guard down!
Right, right.
Crap!
Hinamori! Coming your way!
Hado 31 Shakkaho, Red Flame Cannon!
Kira!
Kira!
Abarai!
Easier than I expected.
It was our teamwork. No one couldve done it alone.
Stupid! I couldve won by myself, easy!
Heck, I wish I could fight a real Hollow!
only your talk is big!
I got more than that!
Cmon, lets go back.
Heyhey!
Cmon! I know, I know.
Hey, whats wrong, Hinamori?
Oh. No Its nothing.
Its about time to wrap up.
It ended safely, for now.
This is Hisagi from the meeting point.
Barrier unit, whats the situation there?
Hey, come in!
Whats wrong, barrier unit? Can you hear me?
Hey! Answer me!
Hey!
Whats wrong?
Strange No answer from the barrier unit
Hisagi!
Whats that?
I wonder?
Cmon!
WhaWhats that?!
Its huge
Crap! A Huge Hollow? No way!
Why didnt we sense its approach?!
Bastard, you killed Kanizawa!
No! Aoga!
Aoga!
Run, Freshmen! Get as far away as possible!
So thats a real Hollow?
Fool! Whatre you doing?! Run!
Soul Society, requesting assistance!
This is Shuhei Hisagi, 6th grade squad leader!
At World of the Living, point 1026!
Being attacked by a Huge Hollow at NW 2128
Why?
Why are they all running away?
Whatre you doing, Hinamori?!
We were told to run! Orders must be obeyed!
But
Its impossible! It got two 6th grade students in a blink!
But!
Hinamori!
Damn! I cant see!
Fine! I aint done yet!
You!
Forgive us, sir! For disobeying your order!
We came to save you, so overlook this, okay, sir?!
Ruler!
Mask of flesh and blood, all things in the universe fly!
That which names all in nature! Gathering of heat and war
Beyond the seas in reverse, take steps to the South
Hado 31!
Shakkaho, Red Flame Cannon!
Now, sir!
Right!
How could such a gigantic Hollow get so close?!
I dont know. I never heard of it before,
but it probably can conceal its Spiritual Pressure.
Were not strong enough to defeat it! What should we do?
I contacted Soul Society!
Well just have to hang on until help comes!
Wh-Whats happening?!
Things are getting blurry..!
It cant be
It called its friends!
So many Huge Hollows! Its crazy!
No It cant be
No I dont want to die
I dont want to dieahaa
Sorry to keep you waiting. We came to rescue you.
Y-Youre!
Captain Aizen of Squad 5. And Lieutenant Ichimaru!
You persevered well. It mustve been scary.
Youre safe now.
Well take over now. You go and rest.
