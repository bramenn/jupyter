Somebody!
Isn't there anyone around?!
Whoa! What's going on, Ms. Kyoko?
Ichijo, huh? Where are the other students?
Everyone's gone home for the day.
I'm the last one.
Whaaat? So I was too late.
Hey, I know!
All right, Ichijo, do something for me.
You look like the kind of guy who has a lot of friends.
The thing is, see, I was supposed to pick some students to clean the pool,
but it totally slipped my mind.
And so you see, Ichijo...
Tomorrow, Saturday, round up some friends and clean the pool, will you?
Whaaat? Hold up!
Why does it have to be me?!
I'm begging you, Ichijo!
I'm in a real bind here!
I'm always, always taking care of those animals on holidays, aren't I?
So the least you can do is return the favor!
Well...
All right, I'm counting on you! The rest is up to you!
Cleanup Day
So?
You were at the end of your rope, so you came crying to me?
You really are a handful for a bean sprout!
I owe you big time.
But you know what, cleaning the pool sounds kind of exciting to me!
Sounds fun!
Talk about thinking positive...
Who else did you ask?
The thing is...
Basically, I called on the guys,
but aside from this one they all turned me down.
Looking forward to this, Kirisaki!
Don't you have any friends?
If you'd said some girls' names, they all would've come running.
Like I could take advantage like that.
Ichijo!
Sorry to keep you waiting! I'm looking forward to working with you today!
Onodera... Hey, thanks for coming!
Huh? Who's this girl?
How do you do?
I'm Haru's friend.
Haru calls me Fuu-chan.
What are you doing here?
Now, now...
You came, too, Haru? You're so cute!
Did you really think it would be so easy?
You're not getting anywhere near my sister!
Of course I'm not.
Young Mistress!
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Getting changed into this held me up.
Morning, Tsugumi!
Hey, that looks great on you!
Didn't you have anything that wasn't quite this sparse?
I know I shouldn't say that when you're lending this to me.
Hey, so you came, too?
It's Paula-chan, right?
Don't give me that chan treatment - it's creepy.
I'm here because the Black Tiger summoned me.
Young Mistress Chitoge?
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.
I'm Paula McCoy of the Beehive Hitman Team.
I have offered my life and pledged my fealty to the organization.
Should you need anything, please feel free to let me know.
Y-Yes... N-Nice to meet you.
What do you want me to do, Black Tiger?
First, let's inspect the equipment.
Master Raku!
I've missed you so
Whatever do you think you're doing, Kirisaki?
I can read you a mile away!
I guess we're all here, then.
You guys, thanks for coming today.
Once we're done, we're free to have fun as we want,
so let's get this over with as soon as we can!
Right!
Take that!
Take that!
If I could just turn all this into a DVD, I bet I'd make a killing...
Forget it.
These are all people you definitely wouldn't want as enemies.
Let's dig in!
Wow! Looks yummy!
This is sooo good!
Did you make all this yourself, Haru?
Well, I did leave the presentation to my sister.
My intent was to whip up a conventional meal,
but before I knew it they'd become posh box lunches.
Alchemy!
Paula! Aren't you going to eat with us?
Would you mind setting some aside for her?
I'll hand it to her later.
All righty, how should I go about provoking the Black Tiger next?
Shall l toss that boy into the girls' locker room, maybe?
Whoops-a-daisy...
Hey... what do you think you're doing?
That's dangerous!
But you climbed up here, too, Paula.
And besides, I thought I'd enjoy my lunch more if I ate it up here.
Here you go! This is your share, Paula!
I don't want it.
But it turned out so tasty!
What's this girl's problem?
Hey, Paula, you're always looking at Tsugumi, aren't you?
What's your relationship to Tsugumi?
Oh, did you go to the same junior high, maybe?
That's none of your business!
Well, you see, I've got an older sister.
See, over there!
My sister's name is Kosaki,
and she's always been sweet and a little ditzy, but she's really dependable,
and she's my beloved, precious big sister!
I was wondering if maybe you felt the same way towards Tsugumi, you know?
I told you, it's none of your business!
Why are you paying so much attention to me, anyway?!
What's the problem? You're so stingy!
Everybody's starting to jump into the pool!
Young Mistress! You forgot to stretch!
Why don't we go in, too, Paula?
We've got floats and water pistols and stuff!
Do whatever you want.
Hold up! No way!
Amazing!
Jeez, talk about acting too buddy-buddy.
What do I care about relationships?
They're sure handling those water pistols like amateurs.
If it were me, I'd go like...
What the...?
What's the big idea, damn you?!
No, what do you think you're doing?
It's so obvious that you're dying to join in.
If you want to play, then just play.
What... Wh-Who wants to...?
I have absolutely no desire to play!
Dummy, you can't hide it.
It's written all over your face.
Didn't you say you were trying to learn more about this world?
But I don't have a clue...
I've never played with so many people like this,
and I have no idea what expression I should have when I join in.
Idiot!
Who cares what your expression is - if you don't join in, you'll never know!
You do have some interest in why Tsugumi changed after coming here, right?
Then come on.
Everybody's waiting.
Paula! Thank goodness, you came back!
Hey, hey, wanna swim together?
No... I...
You're not gonna swim?
Just let me make one thing clear. I'm not here because you told me to come.
I just felt like taking a break, that's all.
Yeah, sure, gotcha.
Come on, come on, don't be shy!
Let's swim!
I told you, I...
M-My legs...
Paula... you can't swim?
Oh, shut up! You got a problem with that?!
Whaaat? No way! Who knew?
So you do have some endearing aspects!
Shut up! Shut up!
I'm never getting into the pool again!
Hey, don't be like that, all right?
How anyone finds this fun, I'll never know! Jeez, I'm so wiped!
Youth, eh?
Visiting the Sick
Onodera's got a cold?
That's right.
I want to go see her myself, but I've got something to do.
Ichijo, would you mind going in my place?
But are you sure it's okay for me to go?
What are you talking about?
Kosaki says she wants you to come over.
Whaaat?
ONODERA JAPANESE CONFECTIONS
And so I did end up coming,
but is it really okay?
A guy visiting a girl at home alone?
Closed for the next few days
Huh? The shop is closed.
Come to think of it, Miyamoto did tell me to go in from the back.
Yes?
Yes? Who's there...?
Huh? Wait... Onodera?
What's wrong, Onodera? Open up, will you?
Okay? Come on!
I-Ichijo... what are you doing here?
Well... Miyamoto said she had an errand to run, so I'm here in her place.
She never said anything to me!
What the hell, Miyamoto?
Giving me false hope!
Thanks to you, I've come to see her, but...
Hey... My fever's going to spike!
All right... All right, why don't you come in for now?
Are you sure?
How are you feeling?
Yes, it's fine.
I still have a fever, but I've got some medicine.
Come to think of it, the shop's closed today.
Yes, the thing is, Mom's away on a trip with her friends from the shopping arcade.
She won't be back for another few days.
What? Meaning that...
could it be that today I'm here alone with Onodera?
Hello? Is this the police?
There's a prowler inside my home!
Hold up, hold up, hold up! Who are you calling a prowler?
What are you doing here in our home, Senpai?!
Just get out of here right now!
Hey, Haru!
Ichijo came here to check up on me, you know?
You shouldn't be rude to him!
But there's no need.
For him to check on you.
You've got me at your side, Sister.
All right, Senpai, thank you for coming over! There's nothing to worry about anymore!
Hold up, hold up, Haru!
Uh... If you like... Here!
You did tell me that you loved the strawberry rice cakes from Suzumiya.
Dangling a carrot in front of me... did you really think that would work?
Well, I guess I'll let you stay for a little while, but...
Thanks.
Then would you mind if I borrowed your kitchen?
I'd like to make some rice gruel or something.
You don't have to do that.
Oh, then I'll give you a hand.
Sister, you rest up, all right?
So...
What are you plotting, anyway?
Are you planning to take advantage of my sister when she's vulnerable?
I'm not plotting anything.
I find that very hard to believe.
Coming here when you already have a girlfriend...
won't that gorgeous girlfriend of yours be pissed?
Well, it's...
It's really complicated, you see...
How interesting.
A situation where you're allowed to be a two-timer? What could that be?
It's no good.
Far from being alone with Onodera, it doesn't look like I can even have a nice talk with her.
Could it be that you're after that locket?
I'm not handing it over.
I'm going to give that back to my prince myself!
No, although I do admit I want it back.
Don't let your guard down, Haru.
Now that Sister's so vulnerable, I've got to protect her!
Sister!
Your rice gruel is read
Why are you cleaning up, Sister?
Come on! You're sick, so you've got to stay in bed!
I couldn't help it.
Who knew that I'd ever get to enter this room again.
Here, Sister, we made you some rice gruel. Have it!
Okay.
Sister? All right, say ahhh!
It's all right, I can eat on my own.
What do you say?
Aren't you jealous?
Th-This kid!
Um...
Yeah, I think your fever totally broke.
Looks like you're going to be all right!
All right, Sister, drink lots of water and get lots of rest.
Just call me on my cell phone, and I'll come anytime!
Right.
Come on! Let's go, Senpai!
I know, I know!
Huh?
But I am still running a temperature.
All right, there's nothing else you can help out with, Senpai.
Why don't you take your leave now?
Sorry, Haru.
Hey! What are you doing, all of a sudden?!
That was totally sexual harassment!
Haru, you've caught Onodera's cold, right?
I-I did not catch it.
As you can see, I'm fit as a fiddle...
Go to bed!
No!
If I collapse, too, what's going to become of my sister?!
I don't have any plans today,
so I could look after her, if that's okay.
Why would it be okay?! Something like that!
If it means leaving my sister in your care,
I'd rather just pass out myself!
Hey, that's enough!
If you were to push yourself too hard and collapse,
who'd end up feeling the most responsible?!
Hey, I don't want to make Onodera feel uncomfortable, either,
and I don't intend to.
And I don't have the guts to do what you're so worried I will.
Understood.
Seriously...
Pushing herself so irrationally for someone else's sake...
I can see that she's Onodera's kid sister, all right.
Coming in!
Haru,
you still haven't eaten, have you?
I did make you some rice gruel.
I don't want it, really.
It's not like I have any appetite.
Come on, don't be so stubborn.
You need to eat while you can.
Or is it something else?
Want me to feed you like you did Onodera?
Here... ahhh...
Sorry, I shouldn't have done that.
I just have to eat it, right? Right?
Yummy!
Well? Is it good?
What is this?
It wasn't the least bit good!
You can't even make a decent rice gruel.
Your ineptitude is enough to make me drool!
Oh, is that right?
All right, I'm gonna leave this drink here,
so be sure to keep sipping it and get some rest, okay?
See you.
What's up with that? Pretending to be a gentleman...
When he doesn't give a second thought about two-timing.
Well, but that rice gruel was good.
My body feels so hot.
I was all tensed up till now...
so the fatigue just hit me at once.
I think... I'm in agony...
What's this?
Something cold on my forehead.
It feels so good.
When did I fall asleep...?
I-Ichijo-senpai!
What are you doing sleeping here?
A cold compress?
Is that what felt so good?
Have you been changing them all this time?
For me?
But why?
This guy... He's not the kind of person to do such a...
He's really gentle, you know... Ichijo.
Whoa, my bad! I must've nodded off.
Who knew I'd fall asleep here?
It's all right, don't worry!
I swear I didn't do anything to you! So everything's fine, okay?
Hey, that's right,
how's your fever?
Yes, thanks to you, it came down a lot.
Is that right? Thank goodness. Hey! Not good!
I've got to go change Onodera's compress, too.
Whoa... Whoops, whoops, whoops!
Oh, crap, I went and did it! My bad, I'll pick that up right now!
Wh-What's so funny?
Well, but Ichijo-senpai,
you're somehow even weirder than I thought!
You haven't smiled at me like that since we first met in the hallway.
Wh-What's that supposed to mean? Is there a problem?
No... there's no problem.
Ichijo-senpai, if you please.
A lot has happened between us, but...
You're giving it back to me?
No, I'm not!
I'm just leaving it in your care.
When the day comes for me to be reunited with my prince,
please give it back to me.
Until then, I'm granting you special custody.
But in return,
please let me see my prince again someday.
Or else I'm going to stick a needle in your eye!
Right... Roger that.
But see, that's...
I admit he's just a tiny bit different than what I thought, Sister.
