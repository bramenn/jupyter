New Year's food!
New Year's food!
We've got a lot here.
Let's see.
Everyone put work into their cards.
Oh, this one's from the President.

Cinderella comes running naked at midnight.
What do you even say to that?!
Do you know what cherry blossoms stand for?
No, I didn't know they stood for something.
Tell her, Shino-chan.
Being well-cultured, noble, pure, and innocent.
Ultimate legendary days!
Do you remember what I told you?
No problem here.
Of course.
Well-cultured, noble, pure, and innocent!
Happy New Year
Happy New Year.
Tsuda Takatoshi here
Tsuda Takatoshi here.
I'm here at a New Year's sale
We've been here since five in the morning
I'm here at a New Year's sale.
We've been here since five in the morning.
I didn't think you'd want to come.
I'm a little surprised.
I'm here to help my sister carry stuff.
Hey, you're not supposed to carry me!
Right... Sorry.
You sure don't want to be here.
Seitokai Yakuindomo
It's Happy New Year's
I brought some hot tea.
Thanks.
I feel warmer already.
But if you drink too much you'll have to take a leak.
Yeah.
Marking territory.
Putting down fertilizer.
Why won't you say go to the bathroom?
Happy New Year!
We're opening up!
Oh, it's a mystery bag.
That's up there.
Oh never mind, I can reach it.
Right.
Oh?
Happy New Year.
Ousai's a relatively well-known school.
Make sure you all keep yourselves in line.
Especially you, Vice President Tsuda.
That was pretty good, Igarashi.
Huh?
This is what you meant, right?
well known -> gets around (F) in line -> erect (M)
Hello, everyone.
Flash
Happy New Year.
Oh, Happy New Year.
Flashes her peace sign too
Huh?
It matches my V-line perfectly.
Got you now!
Happy New Year, everyone.
Are you taking pictures, Hata-san?
What are you taking pictures of?
Swap pictures.
Oh, I mean snap pictures.
Messed that up.
Huh? Did you really?
Taka-nii!
Let me borrow some money.
Guess I'll have to.
But I want it back with some interest.
Always wanted to say that
Taka-nii.
You totally took that the wrong way, didn't you?
Third Trimester
What is your resolution this year?
I want to make good on my promises.
Makes sense wanting to get things done,
given you're the President here.
Prez,
I need your approval on that sign we mentioned ASAP.
Got it.
This is my sign to tell people I need to get laid!
So you're wrapping your hair around yourself
so they look like tentacles.
I don't understand what's going on anymore.
My resolution?
I guess I want to make sure I stay fit.
Well, that's just boring.
Boring...
You're the Vice President, so you should...
Hm?
I can't remember what I wanted to say...
I guess I want you to service me more with your mouth?
I think you meant lip service.
Resolution?
I guess I'd like to develop my arm strength.
That's rather specific.
I picked up a ball that fell near me the other day,
and this person wanted me to throw it back.
There.
Flop
And well, it was kind of embarrassing.
I see.
That makes sense, though you'll develop muscles during puberty.
I'm past puberty.
Resolution?
I guess I want to do better under pressures.
Oh, no!
Oh no! I messed up when I said that!
I can't believe I did that...
You're not acting very calm right now.
I keep doing it!
Blow
Hm?
Also, I...
And you kept your calm there, huh?
Resolution, huh?
I guess I want to be more honest with myself.
I see.
Hey, don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not doing what you think I am.
I'm practicing my soap opera moves.
I see.
My resolution for this year?
I want to get to the nationals!
You like martial arts too much.
Why all the passion?
I guess because of my parents.
They were always practicing pro wrestling at night.
I guess you grew up innocent.
What about you, Hata? You have a resolution?
My resolution?
I want to get a real exclusive story,
but I think that'll be pretty hard.
My readers are all high school students, too.
Why's that?
Kids like scandals regarding the relationships between men and women.
What was it? People something other people's misfortune?
I'm sure that something's pretty salty, though.
I mean, a man and woman is involved.
It's enjoy.
She got there before I did.

What is it?!
Don't move, Hagimura!
This is fake slim*.
Continued in the latter half
It's cold.
Really cold.
You two don't have it together.
Kids play outdoors in the cold, and they don't have problems.
We're in high school now, so we're not kids.
Yeah.
We might even be sent here by the wind god himself.
You don't sound like a high schooler.
Setiokai Yakuindomo
What it takes to stand above someone
Hmm...
It feels weird wearing new shoes.
Wearing shoes that don't fit gives you blisters.
Oh, good morning.
Hi there.
Hey.
And if you rub that area, it'll get stiff.
I didn't think I'd get to say something
like that so early in the morning.
This world works wonders.
And you're thinking about that this early?
Lunch
It's so cold, my lunch got all cold, too.
Yeesh, it's a little bland.
Chomp
Rice tastes better right after it's made.
Clothes are better right after they're taken off too, right?
Don't look at me like I gave you that idea at some point.
Yeah, that's true.
Prez, that's mine...
Oh, sorry.
I almost had an indirect kiss there.
I wonder if he wore your panties on his head,
if that'd also be an indirect kiss of a different type,
his lip* and your puss*.
I don't know if that helps.
I'm thinking of trying to get a manager.
It's hard to manage everything with so many members.
I see. So, what's up?
I want to create some fliers,
but I'm not good at writing up stuff like that.
Do you think you could write up something for me?
I don't mind,
but I think you should work on that for your own benefit.
I agree.
I have until I have to send a letter to my parents for my wedding.
I guess that's a nice goal...
Ousai Judo Team Looking for a manager Come to the dojo if you're interested. Someone not currently in a club! No experience needed! Someone who wants to do something memorable in high school!
Maybe I'll give it a try.
Seriously?
Yeah.
Not in a club
I meet the requirements, too.
I'm not in a club.
No experience needed
I'm a virg*n.
You're not doing it. I'm making that decision now.
Always come in from behind
Opinions are split about how practice is going to continue
Everyone,
I have three arrows here that Archery didn't need.
Watch this...
Snap
Everyone follow me!
Right!
She persuaded them by force...
Let's get a pork rice bowl on the way back.
Right!
Hey
Hey, you can't go eat right after you get out of school.
Growl
We have a reason.
We have a practice match tomorrow.
I see...
So you're going to have pork so you don't pork it up.
I'll give you this so you'll be safe.
I'm sad I get where you're going with this.
They say pork will put hair on your back.
It's cold again today.
No one catch a cold.
Don't shake your covers off while you're sleeping, or something.
Everyone here is a heavy sleeper, so I don't think that'd happen.
Bang
I heard that!
How do you know how well everyone sleeps?!
How do you think we know?
Yeah, you need to tell us in detail.
The student council is tenacious when it comes to stuff like this.
My shoulders are stiff.
snap
How about I give you a rub?
Thanks.
Rub
Come on! Grow bigger and give her more backaches!
Scream
Stop!
You dummy!
Valentine's Day Plan
Next week is Valentine's Day.
We have to give chocolate to Tsuda.
According to Aria,
Dejima-san is teaching people how to make chocolate.
How about we all make some together?
That marker's almost out of ink.
You sure?
Class on hand job
Some of the characters aren't written correctly.
Let's lend our hand to do the job?
Let's lenD OUR hand job?
The kitchen's pretty big.
You're good at making sweets?
That's right.
I can make anything.
I can make Japanese food,
Western food, sweets...
Get a man...
Okay, so let's start getting ready.
Right.
Huh? Did they not hear me?
Dejima saved my life.
What's that about?
Last night...
Roll
Catch
Watch out!
I almost fell and got hurt.
I see...
I see.
Wait a second.
Why was Dejima-san there in the first place?
Next we'll be making our patterns.
Click
The breaker tripped.
Miss, where are you?!
Say something if you're fine.
I'm fine
I'm fine.
It's dark and something sexy could happen, but I can't see!
I sense some bad energy.
Crap.
What is it?
What's wrong?
I wanted to see if the chocolate hardened yet,
and then I slipped and my hand...
This might not be that bad.
Yeah, brings back memories.
You know when you're a kid and you
want to see how much you've grown and stuff.
All right. I'm going to remake the thing.
Takatoshi-kun.
Hm?
Here's some chocolate.
Some from me, too.
Thank you.
Hey, Tsuda, don't fall for them!
Yeah!
If you're going to be dere, be a tsundere first!
That's not what I meant.
Tsuda, take this.
Thanks.
No, you're always helping me out, anyway.
I think you have that backwards.
It's kind of embarrassing to hand this over.
Suzu-chan, if it's hard to give it to him,
just follow this script.
Tsuda!
I've got some Valentine's chocolate here.
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
I had to make it. I mean you're part of the student council, and all.
I see.
Depressed
Sorry you had to go out of your way...
Huh?
This happens when someone doesn't get that you're being tsundere
Todoroki Nene's Trivia
Todoroki Nene's Trivia
All right. We're going to get started.
Wait!
What's that?
This is a traditional plant stalk from the Kumamoto Prefecture area.
Back in the Edo period, the Higo Hosogawa clan,
during one of the daimyo's routine visits to Edo,
presented this sex aid to the
Tokugawa shogunate.
Don't try to make it sound fancy.
They'd take giant elephant ear stalk and let it dry it out,
and weave it into a cylindrical shape.
When you want to use it, you let it soak in warm water,
and it becomes soft.
I see...
It's hard to describe,
so I'll just show you.
Zip
This is over!
Todoroki Nene's Trivia
All over...
It's traditional!
It's almost time to think about giving stuff back for White Day.
Please have these!!
Please have these!
But it's kind of weird exchanging presents with girls.
Well, you're an extremely intelligent individual.
I can see why everyone would like you, regardless of their gender.
Hey, what's with all the sucking up, Hagimura?
embarrassed
Though if you're going to be good at something,
sucking's probably it.
Maybe I was wrong.
Seitokai Yakuindomo
Vir*in
Taka-nii,
did you think about what to get people in return for Valentine's Day.
You give candy for White Day,
but that'll get expensive.
Well, it doesn't have to be candy.
There's something else that you can let them suck on.
Well, I can't go into more detail.
I think you already went into enough detail.
Well, I came, but...
I'm not sure what to buy.
Oh, Taka-kun.
Hi there. Bark.
Uomi-sa-
Hey.
Onee-chan.
Very good.
White Day
You're getting stuff for White Day, too?
Too? That's why you're here?
Oh, girls give each other chocolates a lot as of late.
Wait, so are you giving it to your fellow... virg*ns?
Surprise
No.
Who are you giving presents to?
The student council, the teachers,
and my classmates.
You're popular, Taka-kun.
Nah. I'm just socially obligated.
I'm not sure about that.
Some of those people might really like you.
Did you find any pub*c hair in your presents?
No.
I thought of making stuff by hand, but...
You gave up on it?
It took more time than I thought.
The student council keeps you busy, huh?
Also, you know what you're getting if you get stuff off the shelf.
And you know there aren't any bodily fluids in there.
That's enough.
Oh...
I forgot I was your onee-san for a second.
Oh, Tsuda and Uomi, isn't it?
What are you two doing here?
Well...
Uomi-san is trying to take Tsuda around and have him strip.
I think she's thinking something different than the others.
I can't tell them I'm here for the Valentine's presents.
I'll make sure they don't find out.
We're on a date.
They found out after all
So we ran into him while he's picking stuff out for us.
That was bad timing.
I wonder what you say in a situation like this.
Shino-chan,
Tsuda-kun is a masochist.
So I yell at him?
Worried
I'm worried.
Student Council
Here's a small token of my gratitude.
Thank you.
Th-Thanks.
Thanks.
There's none for you.
But I had some of your chocolates!
Yeah, and...
Nude!

Sei to kai Ya ku ind omo
Someone was trying to make this worse for me.
Tsuda,
why are all of these people here?
That's because that's everyone I ran into
after I went to the cafeteria.
Of course, I don't think all of you are suspicious.
I want to hear your alibis.
One of these people will lie, and another will be the culprit
Suzu head
I saw yogurt... on that thing... when I first got back to the
student council room from the staff room.
I see...
I got the mast*rbation aid out of storage and my enema
really started kicking in, so I had to rush to the bathroom.
Then when I got back to the student council room, you were here.
There were a lot of questionable things in there,
but it sounds like you're telling the truth.
Shaking
I went to the dojo for fun,
met the President in front of the cafeteria,
we walked together to the yard, and Shichijou-senpai was there.
You're so scared, but what you said sounded normal,
so that really worries me.
I went to the cafeteria, ran into Kotomi, and saw Aria in the yard.
I'm a D-cup.
I put the white stuff on there.
Huh? It was you after all?!
Squid
Takatoshi
Nude!
All of that, and it ended like this?!
The End
Good morning.
Morning.
Tsuda, you haven't slept in lately,
even though you're not good with waking up early.
I got one of those eco-pillows.
It's made out of natural materials,
so I'm able to sleep on it pretty well.
Tsuda-kun!
It sounded like you said you got a pr*state massager?
Pant
You ran all the way over here to see if I said that?
Seitokai Yakuindomo
I can't believe you're washing that
You've got a pretty simple lunch here, Tsuda.
My parents were gone on a business trip.
Yeah, but you still need to make sure you eat a balanced meal.
How about I make you one tomorrow?
Are you sure?
In that case...
Could I ask you to make two?
Sparkle.
Oh, right.
Then do you have any requests?
Hm...
Anything's...
I guess it's kind of mean if I just said anything.
Maybe a sandwich, or something?
Man Woman Man
I hear those that like sandwiches,
also like sandwiching at night.
That's a lie!
How about cut up hot dogs?
That's pretty basic.
A lunch, huh...
I wonder if I'd look more adult if I made him one, too.
H-Hey...
What do you like to eat?
Gummies, I guess?
Get the hint already.
The next day
Prez...
Kotomi, why are you so out of it?
I was so excited for your lunch,
I didn't eat breakfast.
Growl
I was just kidding.
Sorry.
This is good.
It's great.
I'm glad.
I'm sure you made it with lots of love.
Hey, don't tease me, Aria.
I have lust in there, instead.
If that's the emotion that got you to make this food,
I'm actually kind of impressed.
Suzu-chan, you eat a lot.
I'm still growing.
I won't grow if I don't eat a lot.
You're coming into heat.
Suzu Head
Height!
That was good!
No problem.
I'll wash out the lunchboxes and give them back to you.
You sure?
Yeah.
It's normal to wash whatever you borrow before you return it,
but I borrowed some underwear from Dejima-san today
and she told me to return them without cleaning them.
Make sure they're clean before you give them to her.
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.
Right. See you then.
Oh, Prez.
Thanks for the lunch today.
I'll make you another one if you ask.
Sorry about that.
See you later.
Right.
Sorry about that, huh?
Oh.
Onee-chan.
Taka-kun.
Uomi... san?
