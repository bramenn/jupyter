It's Oracion Seis vs. our Allied Forces!
But all of a sudden the magical bomber Christina, our trump card, was blown up!
Yes!
Then we headed straight into a head-on battle!
Yes!
If it's love and dreams and you it'll become magical.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
I kind of admired this powerful world,
chock-full of problems.
Frozen time has started to move again
ever since I met you.
Why were we born? Why do we live?
I don't need any complicated answers.
Laugh! Cry! Be honest with yourself.
Simple feelings are the most important.
You can change those tears shed on sad nights into strength.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
Incredible...
These guys... are strong!
What's the matter, Brain? Why have you stopped the spell?
Someone you know?
There's no mistaking it... You are Wendy.
The Maiden of the Sky!
The Maiden... of the Sky?
What's that?
What does that mean?
Maiden of the Sky!
I didn't expect to encounter you here.
It looks like we picked up a nice present.
Come!
Wendy!
Wendy!
Charles!
Wait! I'll save you!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Money is the great equalizer, yes!
Charles!
Wendy!
Huh?
Hey, you!
Wendy!
Happy!
I have no more need for you worms.
Begone!
Dark Rondo!
Get down!
Lucy-san!
Sherry!
This is Lyon-sama's love!
Rockiron Wall!
Just barely in time.
Jura-sama!
Amazing, Jura-san!
Thank you. You saved us.
Man, thanks a bunch.
Damn it... Let me at'em!
Huh?
They disappeared?
What the... Hey!
Wendy...
They totally got us...
They're too powerful!
We couldn't even touch them.
Oracion Seis... What kind of monsters are they?
There are only six of them,
but they're even more powerful than the data we collected on them suggested!
And our plan to use Christina is...
Yes... That woman who can peer into your heart said so.
She said that they knew everything about our plans.
Um... What about the people that were on board?
You don't have to worry about that.
Christina was heading to its destination by remote control.
After we found their base, we were supposed to board it, however...
I see! Thank goodness...
I am also glad you remain safe, Jura-san.
No... It was quite a close call.
Those wounds?
A fearsome power it was...
I have numbed the pain for now, thanks to Ichiya-dono's painkiller parfum.
Damn you, Oracion Seis... How dare you run just as we arrive!
We must have scared them off!
You're all beat up, you know!
These injuries? Nothing at all.
Everyone, take a whiff of my painkiller parfum!
Ah... What a nice smell.
Yeah... My pain is going away.
Men!
I wish he would cut out the posing part, though...
Yes, that's our Sensei!
Sensei!
They changed how they call him again?
I'm not even saying anything anymore.
Damn those bastards... How dare they kidnap Wendy and Happy?!
Where are you? Where did you run off to?!
Natsu, where are you going?
Sheesh...
Try calming down a little.
Wings?
Definitely wings.
The cat is flying.
Wow!
This is the magic called Aera.
Well, I suppose it's only natural to be surprised the first time you see it.
You're copyin' Happy!
Say what?
Now who's the one that's surprised?
Anyway... I'm worried about Wendy and that male cat.
But these aren't people we can beat by randomly coming at them, right?
Charles-dono is correct.
Our enemy is stronger than we anticipated.
Men...
And besides...
Erza!
Hang in there!
Poison is spreading around the place that snake bit you...
Ichiya-sama...
I know.
For my honey... Painkiller parfum!
Augment Aroma!
Wait... Will a painkiller help with poison?
Our senpai's parfum works not just with pain, but can cure poison as well.
Wow!
Erza, are you okay?
It looks like she's suffering even worse?
Uh... Oh?
M-Me...?
This...
No... The painkiller parfum isn't working!
Hang in there, Erza!
What'll we do?
Lucy... I'm sorry.
I'm borrowing your belt.
Eyes off!
What are you doing, Erza?
Sorry...
I can't fight like this.
Cut it off.
Don't be a fool!
Please... Someone...
Understood.
I will do it.
Lyon-sama...
Lyon, don't!
Do it!
Stop!
L-Lyon?
Are you really serious?
We need her now more than ever.
But...
Honestly! You Fairies are such weaklings!
At this rate, Erza-san will die, you know!
And what the heck do you know?
This is also...
If you're going to do it, hurry!
Soon the poison will spread through my entire body!
Stop this, Lyon!
No! We cannot allow you to harm the body of a lady!
There must be some other way!
This is Erza-dono's own will!
Here I go!
You value her arm more than her life?
There might be another way.
Don't jump to conclusions!
Just as weak as always, Gray...
I was a fool for thinking you might have changed a little...
Erza!
Erza!
This is bad... At this rate the poison will spread throughout her body!
Wendy could save her.
This is not the time to be fighting amongst ourselves.
We'll work together, and save Wendy!
And that male cat, while we're at it.
Wendy? That little girl has magic that can purify poison?
Impressive...
Not just poison. She can cure fevers, stop pain, and heal injuries.
My... Why do I feel like my identity is suddenly weakened?
But I thought Healing Magic was a Lost Magic.
Wasn't it lost to the ages?
Wait, does it have something to do with the Maiden of the Sky thing?
Wendy is the Sky Dragon Slayer.
Wendy, the Sky Dragon!
A Dragon Slayer?
The details can wait until later.
Actually, I won't tell you more anyway.
What we need now is Wendy.
And although I don't know why, they seem to need Wendy as well.
Which means...
We will save Wendy-chan!
For Erza's sake as well!
And Happy, too!
All right! Let's go!
Deep in the Worth Woodsea.
This is a place which used to be a city of the ancients.
It is said they performed rituals in these caves
by shutting Shrine Maidens inside, where they would hear the voices of the gods...
However, now it is being used by Oracion Seis as their base of operations.
Don't be violent! She's just a little girl!
Happy...
Stop it!
Happy, are you okay?
Don't worry, Wendy. I'll get you out of here, I promise.
Happy...
Brain, who is this girl?
She have something to do with Nirvana?
Doesn't look like it to me.
I see! We'll sell her for money, yes?!
Is that all you ever think about?
As long as you have money, you can even buy love!
Oh yeah?
She can use Sky Magic.
In other words, Healing Magic.
Healing Magic?
A Lost Magic...
An ancient magic that was thought to be forgotten...
Ooh! This smells like money to me!
This little girl?
Impossible!
Exactly.
We will resurrect him!
Resurrect who?
I don't really know... But I'm not going to help bad people!
Oh, you will. You will indeed.
You will resurrect him for us.
Racer, bring him here.
That's a long ways. It'll take even me an hour.
No matter.
I see. If we resurrect him, Nirvana is as good as found.
Is that what you're thinking, Brain?
Cobra, Hot Eye, Angel... Continue to search for Nirvana.
But if we resurrect him, that won't be necessary.
I asked you a question! Who are you trying to revive?
And just in case... Midnight and I will remain here.
It doesn't like like Mid's going to do anything, though...
Ah well, guess we're off then...
Hey, let's race!
The first one of us to find Nirvana...
Gets 1 million jewel! Yes!
A million? That's a lot...
Wendy, what are they talking about?
I don't know either.
What kind of magic is Nirvana?
Magic that switches Darkness for Light.
Light and Darkness?
I don't understand at all.
Around that time, Natsu and the rest have split up into groups to search for Wendy and Happy.
Fairy Tail's Natsu, Gray, and Caitshelter's Charles.
Lamia Scale's Jura, Lyon, and Sherry.
Blue Pegasus's Ichiya, Ren, and Eve.
Wait, Ren... I can't see Ichiya-sama.
Ichiya-sama, where are you?
We're separated...
Ren!
Eve!
Where are you? Men!
And remaining beside Erza are Lucy and Blue Pegasus's Hibiki.
Everyone... Please hurry!
Fretting about it won't help. But there is something we can do.
Something we can do?
Those heading there, and those that remain.
We're sort of a makeshift alliance,
but unless we can function as a team, we can't beat them.
Jura-san called that magic of yours Archive, right?
Yes. I can track everyone's movements like this.
You're not going to go, Lucy?
I can't leave Erza behind, right?
And besides, I'm the least useful in a fight.
You're too modest.
I've heard the rumors.
Like how you beat 19 3-meter tall gorillas...
And during the battle with Phantom, you knocked out Master Jose barehanded!
Or when you fought 1000 Dark Guild members alone at Acalypha!
My legend grows ever more ridiculous...
Speaking of which... Aren't you going to go?
I can't leave two women by themselves.
Oh? You're kinder than I thought.
Definitely not like the impression I got from reading Weekly Sorcerer.
And besides, my magic allows me to tell everyone where this place is.
Even if we save Wendy and Happy, there's no point unless they can return here.
You've really thought this through.
I'm just practicing what Ichiya-sama taught me.
So Natsu-kun's group is there.
So, about this Sky Dragon Slayer... What does she eat?
Air.
Does air taste good?
I have no idea.
How is that different than breathing oxygen?
She volunteered for this mission because she thought she might get to meet you.
Me?
You're also a Dragon Slayer, yes? She wants to ask you something.
To ask me?
Yes. She says that the dragon that taught her Dragon Slayer Magic disappeared 7 years ago.
So she thinks that you might know where the dragon is.
What's the name of the dragon?
She said it was the Sky Dragon Grandine, if I recall...
The Sky Dragon, Grandine...
Seven years ago...
That's it! What about Laxus?
Gramps told us, remember? He's not a Dragon Slayer.
Wh-What's this?
The trees are black?
This ain't right.
Zatou-niisan, they said it's'cause of Nirvana, right?
It's just that terrible a magic!
The earth itself is dying, Gatou-niisan!
H-Hey...
We're surrounded!
It's'cause of Nirvana, right?
You just said that, Gatou-niisan!
Did I, Zatou-niisan?
It's monkeys! We got two monkeys here, whoa!
Those guys are from Fairy Tail!
It was their fault!
Friends of the woman who messed up our plans in Acalypha, huh?
There's another monkey!
We're Naked Mummy, and we work for Oracion Seis!
Let's play!
Naked Mummy?
One of the Dark Guilds.
Lucy told us she fought with them earlier, remember?
We've been had! I thought we were only up against six people!
These guys'll be perfect...
Perfect!
What are you people saying? We have to hurry and break through to escape!
Run? Don't be silly.
They came all this way to greet us...
We'll force'em to tell us where their base is!
Wait for us, Happy, Wendy!
These brats are makin' fun of us!
We're Naked Mummy, and we work for Oracion Seis!
Why do you say things twice?
It's over for you!
What is with these Fairy Tail wizards?
Do they really think they can win against such numbers?
At the same time...
Blue Pegasus's Ren and Eve are also surrounded by another new enemy.
These guys are the Dark Guild Black Unicorn.
Why are they here?
Damn silky hair!
Damn handsome men!
Prepare yourselves!
And as you may expect, Lyon, Jura and Sherry are the same.
These people are Red Hood.
Where were they hiding?
I can't believe they ambushed us like this.
That's the Wizard Saint, Jura!
Defeating him would make an excellent trophy!
Men!
And this man as well...
Wait... I got separated and now I'm all alone...
So... I'm definitely not anyone suspicious...
Men!
Seriously...
This took longer than I thought.
I couldn't get any speed with something this heavy.
Don't be so hard on yourself. No one is faster than you.
That's...
A coffin!
Wendy... You're going to heal this man for me.
I will do no such thing!
Yes, that's right!
Oh, you will heal him.
You must.
What?
This is Jellal.
He had at one time infiltrated the Council.
No...
No!
In other words... He's someone who knows where Nirvana is.
Jellal?
But why? How can he be alive?
Jellal...
You know him?
He was bathed in Ethernano and became like this...
But he is not actually dead, you see.
You are the only one who can return him to the way he was.
This man saved your life, did he not?
Man, we've got monkeys comin' out of the woodwork!
Natsu, these guys are from a Dark Guild!
Perfect!
I'll beat'em and get'em to tell us where Wendy is!
Hey! Don't forget about me, got it?
Guess it's time for a light warm up before the big boss fight!
Next time: The Girl and the Ghost.
Don't let your guard down, or you'll end up without a leg to stand on!
Whatever, just leave it to me!
He's useless... I think I'll root for Gray.
