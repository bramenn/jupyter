What are you doing?!
You looked cold, so I thought I'd be a blanket for you.
Since I am your familiar.
I don't need that!
It's been like this ever since Lucoa came here.
Whenever I'm home, she's glued to me.
I'm a man, too, you know!
All right!
I have to take back control!
I'll teach her who's boss!
I'll uncover her weakness.
Now, then.
Being naked really is the most comfortable.
What is she doing?!
Ah, I really do hate clothes.
That sure is a shortcoming.
Lucoa, Lucoa.
Hmm?
What is it, Shouta-kun?
Here, take this!
Huh?
Your master commands you!
Wear those clothes!
Now, feel uncomfortable and weep for it to end!
I tried it on.
Thank you for the present.
Shit. Onto something else.
How will she handle something bitter?
Black Coffee
Thank you.
I'm the one who can't stand that!
What about our neighbor's scary dog?
Again, I'm the one who's scared of that!
I'm going to be the greatest mage.
I have to have perfect control over my familiar.
I'm sorry!
Lucoa-san's weaknesses?
Yeah.
In that case, I know something good.
Really?
Her weakness is those breasts of hers!
It's hard for her dodge attacks with those.
I don't mean combat weaknesses!
Hmm, in that case, probably liquor.
Liquor?
Didn't Lucoa-san say she could hold her liquor well?
Well, she can hold her alcohol well.
But it's not that. It's that she's a sucker for liquor.
She's usually well guarded, but she'll drink liquor without caution.
So, if you put poison or such in liquor, she won't even notice.
That would kill her, though!
You're asking about weaknesses,
but from a dragon's point of view we humans are just full of weaknesses.
Even if you manage to get something over her, do you think that would sway Lucoa-san?
Isn't your current relationship good enough?
It's not.
Lucoa...
she's always wandering around somewhere,
or teasing me,
or making fun of me.
She doesn't respect me.
That's why I want to strike at one of her weaknesses
and prove myself to her.
I believe she already respects you, though.
Huh?
Miss Lucoa was never the type to stay in one place for very long.
The fact that she's still with you means she does like you.
Huh? Shouta-kun?
You were here?
H-How long have you been here?!
I just arrived.
I-I'm going home.
I'll escort you, then.
Nice seeing you.
I would have told you my weakness if you just asked.
Huh?
The thing I hate most is losing a home.
I once made a huge mistake, you know.
So I was driven out of my homeland.
It made me very sad.
Ever since then, I've been afraid of settling in one place.
But then a friend I thought would never have a home
found one for herself.
It made me kind of jealous.
So that's why you came to me?
But... why me?
You're the one who said it, you know.
You asked me to be here with you.
I was so happy to hear that.
But that was as a familiar...
To be honest, I already know.
You're an incredible being and I'm not a good match for you, as immature as I am.
That's right.
I am an incredible familiar, so I understood you at first glance.
You're a good boy who's kind and trying hard, even if you're overextending yourself.
Knowing that was good enough for me.
Thank you.
Good boy.
I do wish she'd stop treating me like a child, though.
Shouta-kun,
I'm willing whenever you want it, okay?
Wh-What do you mean by that?!
What's the matter?
It's unusual for you to sigh like that.
Well, my parents are paying a visit to my place.
Huh?! Then Fafnir-san has to...
Yeah.
I asked him to go adventure in the mountains or something while they're here, but...
I absolutely refuse!
A new, hardcore game is releasing at the same time.
Then you'll just have to introduce them.
Right.
Both of my parents are pretty forward,
so the thought of them angering Faf-kun
and watching my goods get half-destroyed is... ahh!
You're worried about your otaku collection?!
I refuse.
I can't afford to move from this spot until I've collected all the treasures.
You're hooked on it.
Takeru attacks!
You've already beaten the game,
It deals 120 damage to Siegfried!
so why not take a little break?
I can keep fighting for tens of thousands of years.
You don't need to worry about me.
Tch, another bust.
Well, what should I do about this?
Coming.
Uhh, how do you get Mister Fafnir to listen to you?
I figured you might know since you've known him a long time, Tohru-chan.
Very well.
I do owe you for planning that hot springs trip for us.
Thank you!
So come on, tell me how
With force!
You have to force him to obey you with might!
That's the only way!
Him? With force?!
You do know that's impossible when you say that, right?
Well, that really is the only method I can think of with him.
In Call
Kobayashi-san
When I first met him,
he attacked me for trying to sleep in his cavern and we ended up fighting...
You're not bad.
Neither are you.
So, once we recognized each other's strength,
he finally decided to share a little space in the cavern with me.
So your first time meeting really was like that.
Well, if my advice isn't helpful, why not try asking Miss Lucoa?
Ahh.
Ahh.
That woman, huh?
What's her contact info?
Hey, Kanna!
She hung up on me.
Do I have any way to contact her?
I did register Shouta-kun to my friends list last time we played games together.
Huh? Lucoa?
She said she was going abroad to have fun.
She's not here now.
Shoot.
Do you need help with something?
If I can, I'd be happy to help?
You would?
Yes.
I'm constantly improving my skills as a mage every day.
Helping others out would just be part of my training.
You're a very responsible boy.
Truth is...
Impossible.
That man's a terrifying dragon, right?
Yeah, I suppose he would be.
Hmm. I guess it'll be easier to do something about my parents instead of Faf-kun.
Faf-kun?
If I recall, his name is Fafnir, right?
Is that a unique nickname you call him by?
Huh? Yeah, it is.
And he's accepted that nickname as his own, then?
He said he doesn't mind it.
You can form a pact, then.
A pact?
If you've given him a name and he's accepted it,
then the preparations to form a pact are nearly complete.
Take this.
What is it?
An orb of magic power.
I've poured my own magic power into it.
This should be enough for even someone without magic power like yourself
to activate the ritual to forge a pact.
Hmm.
You're incredible, Shouta-kun.
Uhh, so about that...
Could I ask you for something in return?
Oh? Like some of my lifespan?
A devil would ask for that.
I was hoping you could teach me
how to be a cool adult like you.
Huh?!
That's a pretty surprising request.
I'm not confident I can help.
I'm super pathetic, you know?
It's a promise!
A pact, huh?
I'm home.
A master-servant pact...
Faf-kun.
Hmm?
You can have it.
What?
An orb of magic power?
This little thing
won't get me to go outside.
Tch, no luck, huh?
At least tell me, then.
Why did someone as prideful as you
permit me to give you a nickname?
I didn't even know there was a risk to that.
You...
Hmph.
You should be grateful to the brat that gave you that measly orb.
He gave it to me in return for some advice from an adult.
Adult, huh?
What do you think the term adult means to a dragon?
Huh?
Well, it means they've matured out of their immature state?
No, it doesn't.
That only refers to the physical state of the body.
There is no concept of adult or child in a dragon's mind.
Only strength exists when you live as a dragon.
Their state of mind is dependent upon that.
Parents don't protect their offspring, either.
Dragons didn't start talking about adult or child
until after there were more dragons interacting with humans.
Do you understand, Takiya?
It means dragons are mimicking humans.
They know such values will lead to foolishness, but desire them anyway.
So do the dragons that are here.
We're just masquerading as humans.
You don't really believe that.
I can tell at least that much.
Yeah.
Tohru has firmly declared she won't regret such foolishness.
And that human, Kobayashi, drove away the Emperor of Demise.
I grew curious as to why they would go so far to keep up the act.
So, I decided to try playing the game a bit myself to learn more.
That's the only reason I let you give me a nickname.
Get!! Unique Skill
Siegfried dropped Gram.
Please press any button to
It finally dropped!
Great! This is great!
Takiya!
I'm in a good mood now,
so if you beat me I'll play along with you and your family or whatever.
Huh?
But I can't beat you in strength.
Who said it had to be in strength?
I'm not going to lose!
You dare to challenge me, human?!
You'll never be able to defeat me!
Ah, stop!
Don't use instakill combos!
Weak humans will use any means necessary!
What you think is cool is just my outward appearance.
So, being a cool guy starts with creating your outward appearance.
Huh?!
Uncanny Relationships (One Side Is a Dragon)
Episode 6
The other day I went as far as where the rivers meet.
If that's true, it's worthy of praise.
It is true!
I have pictures, too!
Nice, that's a great photo.
Right?! Incredible, right?!
Stop!
You're so annoying, Hachisuka.
Even caterpillars can go there.
What's that, Saikawa?!
You saying you can make it there, too?!
Of course!
You better go there, then!
Bring back pictures as proof, too!
That's a piece of cake.
What do I do?
Why did I have to say that?
Let's go together.
But we'll have to walk a long way to reach where the rivers meet.
That's fine.
Let's go together.
Kanna-san!
Here, Kanna.
Your lunch and tea.
Here, candy from the candy shop.
Thank you, Lady Tohru, Ilulu.
Have fun.
Mmm.
Saikawa.
Kanna-san!
Feels kind of grown-up, heading out somewhere by ourselves.
Georgie lent me this.
She said to use it to contact her if anything happens.
With this, we're all set to take photos as proof, too!
Tch.
Skip, skip, love, love, skip.
Let's only step on the white parts.
If you fall, you're dead.
Saikawa, you died.
I'm immortal!
Not fair!
Is too fair!
Not fair!
Is too fair!
Hey, Kanna-san.
Pass!
Saikawa!
Nirvana!
One, two, and three!
Your lunch looks so good, Kanna-san.
Lady Tohru made it for me.
Yours looks good, too, Saikawa.
Yes. Georgie's great at cooking!
Thank you for the food.
Ah, I dropped it!
K-Kanna-san, would you let me use your chopsticks with you?
I'll lend you my spare chopsticks.
Thank you!
I'll use them with care!
Tch!
I can use this!
Nice going, Georgie!
Kanna-san, want some potato straws?
I do!
Th-Then...
Here, Fanna-fan!
Saikawa, want some rolled omelets?
M-My heart is so full right now.
That's a shame.
I ate some of it already, but it's really yummy.
You ate some?!
You ate some!
There are all kinds of people here.
I wonder why everyone's coming to the river.
I love rivers.
It feels great to bathe in the water.
Bathe in the water?!
Mmm.
Kanna-san bathing in the water!
Kanna-san!
Oh!
Kanna-san's an angel!
Huh?
Huh?!
This feels so good!
Lady Elma, you forgot your perception blocking.
Oh, no!
Photo, photo evidence!
Kanna-san, move!
So cute!
But right now...!
Oh my?
Huh? Where did it go?!
We did it, Kanna-san!
We made it to where they meet!
Oh!
We need to take a photo for proof!
Want me to take it for you?
Huh?
Oh...
If you would, please.
Sure.
Okay, here I go.
Oh!
Okay, Kanna-san!
Thank you very much.
Where did you two come from?
From Oborozuka.
My, you walked quite far.
We thought we'd walk up to where the rivers meet.
Oh?
You know, long ago, this is where they changed the flow of the river.
Oh!
Why did they change it?
To prevent floods from happening
and to make it easier to grow rice.
Later.
Be careful now.
Yes!
What's the matter, Kanna-san?
Do you think I'll change, too?
Well, of course you're going to get cuter and cuter!
I'm looking forward to it!
Will you change, too?
Yes!
Obviously I'm going to become a great woman!
It's really true!
There was a monster in the river!
There's no way something like that exists!
Tell us more.
It was this big
and it was bathing in the river. Right, Kanna-san?
Saikawa, that was CG.
Huh?
It was?
Huh?
So it was AR?
See, I told you!
Lame.
CG?
CG.
What?
