Kagome, this way?!
It's near! Beyond this forest!
We were in search of Sacred Jewel fragments...
when we met up unexpectedly with Kohaku...
who was being attacked by Naraku's demon.
The demon was after the Sacred Jewel fragment in Kohaku's back.
Kohaku!
Sango was overjoyed at this reunion with Kohaku.
But Kohaku's memory had been erased by Naraku...
and remembered nothing about Sango.
Kohaku has come back to me. He's escaped from Naraku's grasp...
That's what I want to believe.
About Kohaku... It's Naraku's trap!
I believe in Kohaku!
That's Naraku's aim.
What else can I do except to trust him?!
Just then, Kagura appeared to take back the fragment...
bringing an army of demons with her.
If the Sacred Jewel fragment is removed from his back, Kohaku will die!
In order to protect Kohaku...
Inuyasha and Miroku began fighting them off...
while Kohaku and I escaped into the forest.
I want to remember... about her and everything else.
But...what's this feeling?
I feel scared... Something I don't want to remember...
Something...
Kill her... Kill Kagome.
You're all out of arrows.
Kohaku!
Hiraikotsu!
Don't worry, Kohaku!
I'll never let Naraku take you away ever again!
Kagome!
Kirara!
Inuyasha, remember.
We must distract Kagura and her demons as much as possible.
I know that!
Kagura! You need a whole army just to capture one kid?!
Fine with me!
They're falling for Naraku's plan.
Do your work, Kohaku.
What perfect timing!
While we're at it, we'll slaughter you all, too.
Inuyasha... your head is mine!
Dance of Blades!
Kohaku?
What's going on?
All of a sudden, he's changed!
Kohaku, kill Kagome.
Kill her!
Kill!
Kohaku...
Kill! Kill!
Kill!
Kohaku...
Kagome! Kohaku!
Sango!
Kohaku?
So you are still...
Kagome!
I'm all right. It's not serious.
Kohaku...
Kirara, stay with Kagome.
Kagome, it must hurt.
Sango...
I'm sorry.
Sango?
Sango's not planning to...?
There's no end to this!
Dance of Blades!
What's the matter?
Why don't you draw your sword, Inuyasha?
Using the Tetsusaiga to kill the likes of you is wasteful!
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!
Are you using your claws because you still can't control your sword?
You're so smart!
Stupid!
Sorry, Inuyasha!
So that's it?
Shut up! I'll kill you!
The Tetsusaiga!
What's the matter, Inuyasha?
You're having an awkward time of it with your sword.
Damn! It's still too heavy to wield easily.
We must keep those demons believing that...
Kohaku is hiding inside the hut.
Miroku!
Pay attention!
So the hut was empty?
You had us fooled all this time?
You're not going, Kagura!
We still haven't finished this fight!
Could it be...?
Don't be tricked, Inuyasha!
Why, Miroku?
We thought Kohaku was Kagura and the demons' aim!
Yet, none of them are trying to go after him.
Maybe... they faked all this...
and we were the ones who were tricked!
If Naraku's true aim was not Kohaku...
Kagome!
She's taken Kohaku into the forest!
So Naraku is still in control of Kohaku!
You only realized it now?
It's probably too late.
Damn you! Using Kohaku to get to Kagome!
Yeah...
Kagome, the one who uses the bow and arrow...
She's a nuisance.
Miroku! What're you doing? There are poison insects!
Wind Tunnel!
Miroku! Don't be so rash!
Miroku!
You're sucking in the poison insects, too!
Inuyasha, go after Sango and Kagome.
Gotcha! Sorry, Miroku!
Don't you dare die!
- As if I'd let you get away! - Don't move, Kagura!
If I turn, I'll suck you in, too!
Damn!
No thanks!
She escaped!
Miroku! Are you all right?
We... must... hurry after Inuyasha...
Yes.
Damn kid! Looking like he wouldn't even hurt a fly!
Kagome!
Kohaku!
So, after all...
you haven't escaped from Naraku's grasp.
You came to hurt Kagome... to steal the Sacred Jewel fragments.
Rather than let Naraku continue his control over you...
I'd rather...!
Kohaku, I will free you!
Kohaku! I won't let you go alone.
I will follow immediately. So...
Kagome!
Inuyasha! Go after Sango!
She seemed strange...
Kagome! You've been hurt by Kohaku.
It's just a scratch.
And that boy, if he really wanted to, had a chance to kill me.
But he didn't.
Sango doesn't know that.
She may intend to kill Kohaku.
All right, I understand.
Kohaku didn't finish off Kagome.
Does that mean he disobeyed Naraku's orders?
If so...
even if he is being mind-controlled, Kohaku still has a human heart!
Kohaku!
Uh...
It's...
This is embarrassing...
What're you so shy for? We're siblings.
Kohaku, you won't go anywhere anymore.
Because you're my brother...
because you're my one and only brother...
I'll kill you, then kill myself.
This is the only way to get you back from Naraku!
Forgive me, Kohaku!
I'll kill you, then kill myself.
This is the only way to get you back from Naraku!
Forgive me, Kohaku!
Stop, Sango!
l-Inuyasha...
Don't stop me, Inuyasha!
Stupid fool! Killing Kohaku will only please Naraku!
Kohaku! Why don't you...
snap out of it, too!
Kagura!
As ordered, Kohaku will kill Kagome.
Kohaku is unable to defy Naraku.
What?!
Inuyasha...
why do you think Kohaku has lost his memory?
Because Naraku is controlling his mind!
That's part of it.
But Kohaku himself is resisting remembering...
such terrible memories.
Stop! Don't say anything more in front of Kohaku!
Why you... Kagura!
Kohaku didn't want to remember...
so Naraku granted his wish and erased his mind.
Now, it's so easy to manipulate someone with no memory.
Kohaku! Remember! Remember it all!
About Sango and the slayers!
Inuyasha!
Remembering each and every detail! If you want to live!
Stop!
If he doesn't remember it all...
he'll continue to be under Naraku's control...
and Naraku will take the Sacred Jewel in his back and kill him!
You say awful things, Inuyasha.
Wait, Kagura!
If he really remembers everything he did...
this kid will truly be destroyed.
It's kindness to let him die without remembering a thing.
Kohaku...
Damn...
Not again?!
Sango...
It's the same thing all over again.
Damn, what troublesome siblings!
Inuyasha!
Hey, Sango!
Let me tell you this, so you don't jump the gun next time!
Naraku ordered Kohaku to kill Kagome!
But Kohaku didn't kill her!
That's because he still has a human heart.
That's why we cannot kill Kohaku. Get him alive!
Got that?!
Yeah.
Kohaku...
I spared your life and made you forget everything.
Yet you failed to kill Kagome.
Why is that, Kohaku?
Do you want to regain your humanity?
Then do you want to remember?
Remember it all?
No! No!!
Good.
I'll let you live for now.
Forget it all.
Yes.
But...I can't forget that woman's face.
A village is attacked by bandits.
Gatenmaru, the vicious leader, is actually a moth demon in disguise.
Inuyasha and Miroku are trapped in a poison cell!
Meanwhile, Sesshomaru searches for clues to how Inuyasha transforms...
and learns frightening secrets from a tree demon.
