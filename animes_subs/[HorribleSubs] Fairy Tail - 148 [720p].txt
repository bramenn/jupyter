Out of my way, Michelle!
Don't come any closer to Nee-san!
Leave us alone!
Listen to me and your lives will be spared.
What's that?!
You have some gall tricking us! And you call yourself a Man?!
Release the princess now!
Everyone...
Michelle!
Don't worry.
I'll protect you, Nee-san.
That's our line!
Elfman and I will draw her away.
Meantime, you grab Lucy and get out of here, Coco.
Roger!
Let's go!
Thanks to the previous Master, we're being protected from Real Nightmare,
but that's him... How can I put it...?
Shut up! I'm sorry for being an inept master!
Don't take offense at every little thing!
What's the status of Kinana's search party?
Well, Fried's runes should hold out for several hours,
but they haven't found any trace of her yet.
Shit. I'm getting impatient...
Is there anything I can do?
The Master should just sit around with gravitas.
By the way... I haven't seen Romeo lately...
I still thought of him as a rugrat...
I'm trying to say he's become a man.
Yeesh. He reminds me of someone I know...
Ow...
Wait for me, Natsu-nii, Lucy-nee...
Michelle...
An Angel's Tears!
Man!!
Elfman! Coco!
E-Eight points... I'm alright!
Natsu, be careful! She locks on to the vitals!
Last time, she she took you out with one shot, remember? One shot!
Don't say it twice!
The human body is interesting, isn't it?
No matter how strong the person,
if you strike their weak spot, they'll suffer intense pain and lose control of their body.
Are you really the crybaby, klutzy, gluttonous Michelle?
That was just a performance so I could blend in with the guild.
And my name is Imitatia.
I'm a member of the new Oracion Seis.
How dare you?! You damned liar!
Intense pain and losin' control of your body...
Ow!
You're not coming out!
It's useless.
My body doesn't feel pain.
It doesn't matter what I'm hit with, I'll never give in.
Likewise, I won't be taken in by any silly emotions.
Silly, huh?
Then why's your eye like that?
My eye?
Yeah, your eye.
Somebody who fights with confidence,
bad guy or not, has a stronger brightness in their eyes.
They don't have a hesitant look in their eye like you do.
Coco! How you doin' over there?!
She's not budging!
I'm not hesitant about anything! This is all for Nee-san's sake!
My heart won't be swayed!
Is that right?! Well, we're not hesitant either!
If Happy's hunch is right,
the only way to save Lucy is by wipin' the floor with you!
So I'm gonna go all out!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Man!
That doesn't feel hot at all!
Take Over! Bear Arms!
What is this?!
My cilice brings pain to any and all vulnerable spots!
Brilliant Flame of the Fire Dragon!
Tricking and using Lucy Heartfilia! Is that your duty?!
Duty?!
Coco!
I don't follow such thoughtless things as duty.
I follow my own heart and decide what to do.
It's exactly because my heart aches that I have such strong feelings.
Magic is the heart.
And no one can beat the power of my feelings.
Well?
No good. I can't find her. What should we do?!
At this rate, Samuel will kill...
Don't lose your cool. This place is huge. He won't be able to find her so easily.
Legion wants to stop the Infinity Clock just as much as we do.
So why...?
After getting to the bottom of the truth, is that the answer you arrived at, Sammy?
That's the decision he made. His viewpoint is different from ours.
But he's completely mistaken.
You're brothers, aren't you? Do something!
I have no memory of becoming his big brother!
This isn't a duty or a calculation...
It has nothing to do with Exceeds or humans or guilds or the church...
What's important is what I'm doing for whose sake...
For that sake, I have no other choice, Nii-san!
Actually, we've finished deciphering it.
You know how to stop Real Nightmare?
It seems the only way is by erasing the carved seals on the Infinity Clock,
thereby negating right to ownership.
Then Happy's hunch was right!
So he's backed up by evidence.
Happy did an outstanding job this time around.
Grim Reaper and Racer have been defeated.
There are four left.
If those four are beaten, Lu-chan will be saved!
Actually, knowing that, all we need now is action.
Natsu and the others will definitely...
Ultra-vibrations that shake the very air.
They instantly shatter any blade, no matter how skilled the swordsman.
Can you hear what I'm thinking?
All I can hear is that you're going to beat me.
Right now, those are the only words in my head.
I can hear your impatience at trying to bring me down.
That and your indomitable will...
For someone who can manipulate sound, you sure yap a lot.
But I can hear voices, too.
Oh?
It's the voices of my friends...
That's your own voice.
It's a delusion, based on what you wish to happen.
Even if that's true, I don't care.
But I always hear the voices of my friends in my head.
They're my inspiration and the wellspring of my strength.
Don't you hear any voices in your head?
Your words grate on my ears.
Stubborn, huh?
Cobra. You must have gone through a painful experience at the Tower of Heaven, too.
Why are you trying to make innocent people suffer the same way?
You're referring to Real Nightmare?
To be honest, I don't give a damn.
But I lost my friend, while you're surrounded by them.
I don't like that.
Stupid envy...
Come out of the shadows and into the sunlight.
When you look at things that way, your feelings will change naturally!
Look at things?
As if you know anything about me...
Four of you left...
That makes things easier.
Why are you taking your clothes off?
Last time, you knocked me for a loop, but this time is gonna be different.
I hate men who are persistent.
This is to save Lucy. I got no interest in belting women,
but I'm gonna hit you with everything I've got.
Huh? Where...
Where am I again?
I see. Got it. So Happy was right on the money, huh?
If all of the members of the new Oracion Seis are defeated,
the engraved seals will disappear and they'll lose ownership.
And with no one to control the Infinity Clock,
Real Nightmare will vanish.
What about Lucy-san?
Jean-Luc thinks that if the seals are wiped out, Lucy will be released.
What is that? It feels like the sky is in turmoil...
Maybe with two out of the six members' seals gone,
the effects of Real Nightmare have weakened.
It somehow feels like the Infinity Clock is struggling to protect the engraved seals.
Hi! How are you doing?
You again?!
Ice Geyser!
An angel's sunshine is bright.
Huh?
That was my decoy!
Ice Make Death Scythe!
You...
It seems that your angel went back home to heaven in a hurry.
Went back... to heaven?
Come. Run me through.
What the hell are you doing?!
My wish is to disappear into the sky, like an angel...
Come on, send me to the sky like the angel.
Send me after him. Pierce this body.
This scythe is the scythe of Death himself.
Don't talk stupid!
You mean you can't?
Yeah, that's right. I can't.
If my wish can't come true, I'll destroy you!
The cost is 30. I summon Baraquiel!
Yeesh! One right after another!
Angel, my ass! You're just a human!
Destroy him...
Crap!
You!
The Legion's number one lancer, Dan Straight, is here!
You again?
I finally found you, Ange-myun.
That shyness of yours is such a turn-on.
You're my apple.
Baraquiel! Get rid of them both!
Cut it out! Don't get between two people who are in love!
Hey, you! I'm jealous of you for getting to be alone with Ange-myu!
Give that role to me!
You know what situation Lucy's in right now, don't you?!
Natsu and Coco will do something to get my old girlfriend out of a pinch.
Old girlfriend?
Did you hear that?! Gray has given the two of us his blessing!
Utterly disagreeable...
Now there's nothing between us! Come on, let's go on our honeymoon!
You're repulsive!
Is that what you call divine punishment?
Barbarous... boorish... with not even a shred of intelligence!
I know what you're doing. The kids call it tsundere.
You're both fools.
The cost is 100. Come from the light! Pulverize them in my name!
I summon Raguel, the angel who blows the horn at the end of the world!
Come and get it!
I would die for you!
I won't reward you with that blessing.
Better to leave you a wounded, squirming, pathetic wreck!
I'll show you how I can stop the attack!
This is... a scream... from your heart!
Hey, Dan! Wake up!
Th-This is a form of love, too...
Witch...
That man lacks beauty and intelligence.
He isn't even worth wiping out.
Don't talk like you're so high and mighty.
What the hell are you?! Disappear into the sky, you say...
You who're alive right now, what the hell are you?!
I'm an angel.
What?!
No. It's probably better to call me a girl who dreams of becoming an angel.
But if I keep thinking about it constantly, I'll metamorphose into an angel!
That's right. From a girl's fancy to a true angel...
This power, Angel Magic,
is a miraculous magic that will wash away all of my sins with holy light!
Sins...
The sin of being born human.
Do you seriously believe that?
Summoning angels shortens my lifespan.
But I don't care.
That's the sacrifice I have to make for becoming an angel myself.
Those coins... They're your life... Your lifespan?!
But these wings are elusive.
The more angel power I wield, the more ugliness I can see in the human world.
That's right...
This world is only about people with conflicting desires crashing into each other!
My wish is to vanish into the sky, like an angel...
I want to announce it to this filthy world, then leave...
Fading away... beautifully...
Even though you're alive, you're dead.
What?
What sin are you talking about? Who told you that?
This world is dirty? Bullshit!
Look at him.
The guy gets crushes at the drop of a hat,
but he's honest with himself and lives with all his might!
My comrades are the same way!
In this world, they laugh, get angry, and cry with all their strength...
They're all alive!
But even so, they haven't gotten nearly enough! It'll never be enough!
You say the funniest things.
Now I'm pissed.
Have you lived enough, to the point where it's okay to fade away?!
So you want nothin' more to do with this world,
call it ugly and dirty, as if you would know?! How dare you?!
To me, it sounds like nothin' more than the ramblings of some brat pretending to be an angel!
Ramblings, you say?
You don't need to go to all the trouble of disappearing.
You're as good as gone right now!
You mock... my wish?!
You... That body...
Raguel, annihilate that man!
That's right! Destroy him! Slice the fool to ugly ribbons!
Yeesh... This doesn't bode well...
Idiot!
You've been swallowed up by your own magic!
Stay away!
Filthy human, be destroyed!
Let go of me!
Forget it!
At this rate, you're gonna be murdered by this angel you love so much!
What?
The stronger the magic, the more it tends to choose its user!
But if the wizard's mind is weak, the magic will take over and destroy them!
I'm not weak!
My feelings are stronger than anyone's!
What feelings?! Look at this angel!
Is this what your much-admired angels are supposed to look like?!
This thing ain't gonna take you to any blue skies!
It'll drag you down into a pit of darkness!
It's ugly...
This is the true form of the magic you got a hold of!
It's feeding off of your life just so it can propagate!
Look at it closely! It's what you are right now!
This is...
Who are you?!
You're no angel! You're human!
You're a human who's alive right now!
S-Silence... I'm...
Moron! You'll be gone for good!
Is this what you wished for, to be sucked up by this blob of flesh?!
This is... me?
Hang in there! Don't lose to any magic!
Don't disappear!
Disappear? Like this...
N-No... I don't want to disappear!
I don't want to disappear...
I want to live!
I want to live!!
You disappear... angel!
Go back to heaven!
It's over.
Nice timing...
At the same time you destroyed the angel, Gray...
This way, the lifespan you paid out...
I don't understand. Why would you go that far for me, your enemy?
Well, there's no deep meaning to it...
Letting you wink out of existence like that would've left a bad taste in my mouth.
I lost.
You're already back to your old personality!
That way of speaking is cute, too!
One of the engraved seals has disappeared.
There are three left.
Hey, Lucy! Stay with us! You can hear me, can't you?!
Hold on! I swear I'll get you outta here!
There are three members of Oracion Seis left. We'll mow'em all down at once!
That's what you say, but you're the one who's been the human punching bag through all this.
Hey! This isn't the time or place to be sayin' that!
Well, after all, you haven't been able to lift a finger against Michelle.
I-I'm not good with that kind of attack!
Excuses, excuses!
I got no retort for that!
Next time: I Can Hear the Voices of My Friends!
But y'know, it feels like Michelle isn't puttin' her whole heart into those attacks...
Someone who's getting his butt handed to him has no call saying that.
Oh, shut up!
