During our battle with Oracion Seis, Happy and Wendy were captured!
To cure the poisoned, suffering Erza, we need the power of the Sky Dragon Slayer, Wendy!
So that's why we split up and are searchin' for'em!
Wait for us, Happy, Wendy!
If it's love and dreams and you it'll become magical.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
I kind of admired this powerful world,
chock-full of problems.
Frozen time has started to move again
ever since I met you.
Why were we born? Why do we live?
I don't need any complicated answers.
Laugh! Cry! Be honest with yourself.
Simple feelings are the most important.
You can change those tears shed on sad nights into strength.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
This man is Jellal.
He once infiltrated the Council.
We'll show them just how scary we, Naked Mummy, can be, Zatou-niisan!
Let's get them, real quick like, Gatou-niisan!
Yes... We'll show them just how scary we, Naked Mummy, can be, Zatou-niisan!
You said that already, Gatou-niisan.
Did I, Zatou-niisan?
Then we'll show them just how...
Get'em, you lugs!
We sure got an earful of their brain-dead brother banter...
Sounds like they're both the older brother, though.
Damn you!
Get a load of my magic shotgun!
I did it!
M-Monster!
*twinkle*
They aren't half bad, Zatou-niisan.
Shall we take'em on together, Gatou-niisan?
They aren't half bad.
The Girl and the Ghost
Why is... Jellal here?
Jellal... That Jellal?
You know Jellal too, Happy?
Know him?
That guy tried to kill Erza and everyone else!
And he used the Council to fire Etherion!
Yeah... I heard about that...
That guy's still alive?
This man is a ghost, haunted by ghosts...
A wretched idealist...
But you owe him your life.
Life?
What does he mean?
Now, hurry and resurrect this man.
Don't! Whatever you do, don't resurrect that guy!
Wendy...
Wendy!
If you do not resurrect him...
Stop it!
Please...
Don't...
Cure him. It should be simple for you.
Jellal is a bad guy! He's gonna steal Nirvana!
Even so... I was saved by him.
He was dear to me!
I heard rumors that he did bad things...
But I don't believe them!
What are you saying? We were right there when...
Jellal would never do things like that!
Wendy...
Please... Give me some time to think.
Don't do this, Wendy.
As you wish.
You have 5 minutes.
Natsu... This is real bad... Hurry up and get here!
You've got to be kidding me...
Naked Mummy was beaten by just two wizards?
You've got to be kidding me... Naked Mummy was beaten by just...
You said that already, Gatou-niisan.
What was with these guys? They weren't small fry at all!
Wow, they actually had some fight in'em.
Of course they do! They're an entire guild!
What in the world were you people thinking?
Okay, blabber-ape!
Where is your base?
I ain't tellin' you, stupid!
Okay, big-ape!
You guys are crazy, you know that.
Guest, the rest is up to you...
What?
Guest?
Hey there, flame-brain brat! Long time no see.
I really owe you for what you did to me way back when...
You damn flies!
It's you!
Hey ya, you breezy bastard! Long time indeed!
How's it hangin'?
We ain't got that kinda relationship, bub!
Take a hint, sheesh.
That's the guy responsible for trying to use Lullaby to assassinate Gramps and the other Masters!
Oh, right...
I seem to recall I beat the crap out of him.
After the destruction of Eisenwald,
I wandered as a free agent through the guilds associated with Oracion Seis...
Waiting for this day...
The day I get revenge on you flies!
The day the Death God is born once again!
A revenge match? Sounds interesting.
I'm gettin' fired up!
Y-You people are going to fight more?
You're more than just crazy!
Air Magic, Aerial!
I can't breathe!
My eyes are getting cloudy!
My ears are ringing!
I lowered the oxygen content in the air around you.
You should no longer be able to stand.
What's with this guy?
He's got such a cute face!
Let's play with'em!
Trying to make me angry?
Snow Magic: Whiteout!
I'll steal your visibility, and freeze your body!
Still want to play?
S-S-S-S-S-Strong...
Please excuse us...
Damn you, Lamia Scale...
We'll show you a thing or two.
What's this?
What are they trying to do?
Pict Magic?
Unison Pict!
G-Goblins?
Ooh, they're so cute!
Do not let your guard down!
They are...
Kick their butts, Sherry!
Wood Doll!
Owwy!
I kind of feel bad now...
I told you not to let your guard down!
Yes, that's perfect...
While they're distracted by our cute little goblins...
Unison Pict!
A wyvern?
They can even make something like that?
That is some skillful sketching!
Go, wyvern!
Crush the official guild!
This is quite annoying!
Jura-san!
Rockiron Spikes!
Lyon! Sherry!
Ice Make...
Doll Attack...
Invocation!
Rockiron Powder Explosion!
So much for our wyvern!
Does it even matter what we do next?
Even though they be fake, I cannot admire those that use living things so thoughtlessly...
Impressive... Those monkeys were nothing compared to him!
Leave him to me!
Iron Fist of...
Bring it!
Wait... Isn't wind the worst match-up for flames?
When it comes to the elements, yes.
The last time they fought it was a pretty tough battle,
but Natsu isn't the same as he was back then.
Wait, this guy's...
Talons of the Fire Dragon!
This magical power... Compared to before, it's on a whole other level!
Brat! You've improved quite a lot!
Sorry'bout this, Erigor...
But I gotta crush you pretty soon so I can get on with finding Happy and Wendy.
Stop talkin' like that'll be so easy, you damn brat!
I'll chop you to pieces!
Emera Baram!
How do you like that destructive power?
I haven't been playing around either.
I've been training to build up my magic power to get revenge on you ever since!
That's so stupid.
Revenge, again? You're always so obsessed with little stuff like that, Erigor...
What?!
Come on... There's got to be some other reason that gets you fired up...
Yeah, you said it.
This isn't about Eisenwald or Oracion Seis anymore...
As I am a lone wizard, I will defeat you!
Now that's the spirit!
Bring it on!
Come on!
Take this!
Magic Wind Palm!
Blazing Fire Dragon Fist!
Couldn't you have finished that a bit faster, flame-brain?
G-Good going there...
So this is the power of Salamander?
Hey, you! Where are Happy and Wendy?
This is no time for sleeping!
Whoa there...
Where is your base?
The abandoned village to the west? The village of the ancients?
Dug their own grave.
They thought they would beat us, but ended up revealing the location of their base.
Lyon, Sherry... Head to the west.
And you, Jura-san?
I sense a great magic power.
One of Oracion Seis?
Most likely.
I will engage them here!
I suppose I'll let you off with this for today.
You should feel lucky to be alive, young ones.
So... please save me!
Will you shut it, you old fart?
I'm only 29!
We told you to shut up.
Okay! How about this?
I'll be serious this time... So let's have a fair fight, man to man!
Young people these days...
Well, you see... When I'm not in front of a woman, I can't really fight for real...
You know, a skilled hawk should hide its talons and all that...
Shut up, little pig!
Why do we have to bring this guy?
Should we just off him?
You guys should listen to your superiors!
Angel-sama forgot to extract some info.
Oh... That copying magic I've heard about?
Let's carry this guy there, quick.
Men...
Here?
Happy! Wendy!
Wait! There might be enemies here!
It's Natsu!
Racer. Do not let them near.
OK.
Damn trash...
It's him again!
It is time.
Don't do it, Wendy!
The Lost Magic, Healing Magic... If you won't use it now, when would you?
Do it!
Jellal...
I'll handle things here. You hurry and go, Natsu!
Right!
You think I'll let you go?
Charles, now's our chance! Wings!
Oh, well... Get going on this!
Here we go!
W-What?
Why, you...
You stopped my running.
It looked more like you tripped and fell to me...
Are you motion sick?
Happy!
Wendy!
Happy!
Wendy!
Natsu!
Happy!
Natsu!
They're inside!
I can handle you all by myself.
Here I come!
That's...
What the...
Natsu...
I'm sorry...
Jellal...
Erza...
This is bad. The poison seems to be spreading more and more...
Hibiki, have they found Wendy yet?
Actually, I can't contact anyone.
But...
Don't worry.
I'll contact them... I swear.
We're counting on you.
Hang in there, Erza!
I'm sorry...
I'm... sorry!
This person... saved my life...
Wendy! You used Healing Magic?
What are you thinking? If you use that power recklessly...
Wendy!
Why are you here?
Jellal!
Natsu!
Tremendous magical power as always, I see.
What?
Natsu!
Natsu, wake up!
Where'd Jellal go?
He left.
That bastard!
I don't know who that guy is...
But isn't bringing Wendy back with you more important right now?
You want to save Erza, right?
Natsu...
I know that!
Why, that...
Let's go, Happy!
Aye, sir!
That did not go as planned.
Well, it is my mistake for releasing him from the restraints.
But he's never been hostile toward me before.
Could he have overheard the discussions about Nirvana, even as he was sleeping?
Damn that Jellal!
Does Jellal intend to take Nirvana for himself?!
I will not allow it!
It is ours!
We will not hand it over to anyone!
Cobra! Can you hear me?
Jellal has escaped! After him!
Nirvana should be where he is heading!
OK. I heard ya.
And I've already heard Jellal's footsteps.
What incredible speed this bastard has.
My codename is Racer.
Faster than anyone. Faster than anything.
And all I do is run!
He saved them?
Impossible! Brain should have been inside!
How did he...
By beating him up, obviously!
Crap! You're not getting away!
Natsu, dodge!
Happy! Charles!
I said you're not getting away!
Ice Make Rampart!
Gray...
Go!
I told you... I'd get this guy.
But you just used too much magic power!
Whatever, get going!
Gray...
He isn't getting past here, not even over my dead body!
Go! To where Erza is!
I'm gonna save Erza, you bet!
Damn straight you are.
You bastard.
You stopped my running twice now.
And it won't be the last time, either.
Ice can even stop the time of life itself.
So you'll never be able to catch up, for eternity.
You'll always be eating the dust of Fairy Tail.
Erza...
Damn that Gray! He's totally hogging all the cool parts!
I won't let him get away with it!
That's not the issue here!
Gray was thinking about us when he stayed behind!
I'm sick and tired of him acting all cool!
Let's hurry up, Happy!
Does he even listen to a word I say?
Next time: Dead Grand Prix
And what if it's over by the time we get back?
In that case I guess I'll just have to fight Gray.
Why do you have to always be that way?
