I don't see you up this early very often, Ichika.
Although I'm still the last one of the five of us.
I don't know when Miku left the bed, either.
Night
Yotsuba went looking for Miku and hasn't come back, too.
Searching

Miku!
What about him?
Dunno.
Maybe he's still asleep.
So he actually stayed over.
Well, that'll be over with soon enough.
You should come study with us.
It's actually pretty fun.
No thanks.
Don't let him manipulate you, Itsuki.
You should be more honest with yourself.
I just can't get along with him.
I butted heads with him the other day, too.
I find myself getting hung up on the most trivial things.
I can't be like you or Miku, Ichika.
You can, Itsuki.
Say what?
Put your hair to the side like this, and...
There!
We made a Miku.
I'm being serious here.
My bad.
It's a quintuplet joke.
Ichika!
You parted her hair the wrong way.
Also, Itsuki, make a sleepier face.
We don't need this cowlick.
Please stop toying with me!
Hey, Miku isn't here right now, so let's see if we can fool him.
Seriously?
We have to get her changed, then.
Um...
It's fine.
There's no way that guy can tell us apart.

What the hell is going on?
And who's the one sleeping next to me?
I slept in Miku's room last night, and then...
Right, it was Miku wearing these pajamas.
Is it Miku?
Sh-Shoot.
Things will get complicated if she wakes up.
Especially if someone else saw.
M-Miku?!
Wait, Miku's inside.
Which means she's...
Those pajamas...
Wh-What's up, Itsuki?
You can tell, huh?
Um...
About the upcoming midterms...
A-A-Are we done here? Can I go?
Hey!
Get going. I need to get changed.
I don't care anymore!
Crap...
I could have just let her talk to me outside.
Futaro-kun.
Have you seen Miku?
Oh, um...
The library, maybe?
That sounds good.
Why don't we go study in the library for a change of pace?
S-Sure, let's do that.
I'll let Yotsuba know.
Let's see...
Where's Miku?
She's not here.
Is this the right thing to do?
Even if it means getting expelled, I'm never having you teach me!
Thinking about that just pisses me off.
Forget it!
But there are some things that only you can do,
so I'm counting on you.
Uesugi-san?
Is something wrong?
Oh, no, well...
Yotsuba, hypothetically...
Let's say one of you gets held back a year because of their grades.
What will you do?
I'll redo my second year with her.
Then again, I'll probably be the one that fails.
But with you here, it'll be all right.
Uesugi-san?
Futaro-kun.
I forgot my pencil case.
Ichika, I have plenty to write with.
We'll get started first.
Could you get my stuff?
All right.
Be right back.
M-Miku?
Futaro.
I-I thought you went to the library.
Came back to get something.
Ichika and Yotsuba are waiting, so go meet up with them. I'll see you there.
F-Futaro.
Uh...
About last night...
Night?
Speaking of that, did you sleep well last night?
I couldn't get used to the bed, so I slept on the living room floor.
My back hurts, yo.
O-Of course.
Thank goodness.
I'm lying, of course.
But ignorance is probably bliss here.
Okay, see you at the library.
Later.
Aside from that,
there's another lie that I have to tell.
Hey, wake up.
Oh, sorry.
Uh...
Um...
I finally found you,
Miku.
You were avoiding me to skip out on studying, weren't you?
You're going to get it now!
Hey...
Pick up your pen.
Listen...
Open the textbook.
I'm not...
I'm going to be really strict with you as punishment!
You're not failing anything on my watch!
But I'm not...
I haven't seen Itsuki either, come to think of it.
I bet she's busy studying in her room.
There's no way she'd be dozing off at her desk or anything, right?
Something the matter, Miku?
You should be more honest with yourself.
Th-There isn't...
Nothing.
Let's start, then.
What are you working on right now?
Natural Immunity
How do our bodies respond to disease agents?
Biology.
Let's continue, then.
Is there anything you couldn't understand?
Um...
Oh, uh...
Sorry about the day before yesterday.
What're you talking about?
G-Good question.
I don't know why I'm telling you this, Miku.
I'm sorry, too.
Now what are you talking about, Miku?
G-Good question!
Um... About this part...
Oh, you're up to here already?
Well...
Good job making it this far on your own.
I scored 100s on all my midterms!
We all got perfect scores, too!
I guess I have to admit that you're an excellent tutor.
What the hell is this?!
Hip, hip, hooray!
It's a huge success!
It's almost like a dream!
Yeah.
There's no way they'd get any 100s.
They really worked hard this past week.
What?!
You're staying over to study again?!
The exam is tomorrow.
I don't care how efficient we are. We're going to cram.
Itsuki!
Maybe it's worth allowing it for tonight.
And now it's exam day.
You're up early, Uesugi-kun.
Itsuki, just to be sure...
Our school's reporting time is 8:30, right?
That's right.
And the exams start fifteen minutes after that.
Okay.
Any chance that clock's broken?
Oh...
my god!
Hurry up, everyone!
We're leaving you behind, Uesugi-san!
I thought you guys got a ride to school every day.
Ebata-san is Dad's secretary.
If only he were at home with Dad.
Y-Yeah.
What happens if we're late?
What do I tell their father?
I don't want people to see me without makeup.
Everyone's seen what you look like from the other four!
Thank you.
Commendable! But not right now!
Wake up!
I can't take it anymore.
Don't give up.
No, I'm spent.
Itsuki!
I'm too hungry! I can't move!
They all look so good!
You don't have time to choose.
What would you like?
Well, you know, I'm...
I'll buy you something.
I owe you for the trouble, though I won't say with what in particular.
What should I have?
It's hard to decide, isn't it?
I thought you were in a hurry!
Hey, Nino, we're almost there.
Even if we do make it to the exam,
do you honestly think we can avoid failing?
Just so you know, I'm going to tell Dad exactly what happens.
There wasn't much time, but I believe I've done what I could.
I'm counting on you to do your part, too.
Futaro-kun!
Nino!
We're late.
And the exam's starting soon.
I'm sorry. It's because I made a stop on the way.
Me, too.
Do you think the guidance teacher will let us off?
I know.
We have Yotsuba.
Itsuki, call Yotsuba.
Hello? Yotsuba?
You're at school already, right?
Oh, no, it's fine.
Just stay inside.
Hey!
What are you thinking?
I call it Operation Doppelganger.
Good morning!
You!
You're late!
Hang on.
Don't you remember this ribbon?
I do remember seeing it just a moment ago.
I went outside to help a teacher with something.
O-Okay.
The bell's sounded already.
Be sure to take your seat before exams start.
Okay.
Like the shadows, unknowable.
Good morning!
Good morning!
G-Good morning.
M-Morning.
What's that girl doing, going in and out so many times?
I can't believe I lied to a teacher.
What disrespect!
You're way too uptight.
Thank goodness.
You all made it in.
It's the real one.
Huh? Where's Uesugi-san?
Good morning.
You're late, and now you're messing with me?
Figures.
Come to the guidance office!
Futaro...
Hurry up and go!
You'll be fine without me!
Believe in the effort you put in for yourselves!
What are you blabbering to yourself about?!
Let's get good grades and surprise Futaro-kun.
You too, Nino.
Wh-Why me?
Let's give it everything we've got.
Let's do this!
Yeah!
Yeah...
Social Studies
So many difficult questions.
Ashikaga hTakauji
Emperor hGo-Komatsu
Ashikaga hYoshimasa
Hosokawa
I can do history, though.
I wonder what Futaro would say if I got a better grade than him.
Japanese
I remember!
For multiple choice questions with five answers, the fourth one's often right.
English
Synonym for argument...
I don't know. Next.
Remember it as de-ba-te.
I never asked you to teach me.
Math
Done.
I think that about does it.
Good night.
I guess I can check over my equations.
Science
I won't let you quit.
What do you mean?
I told him earlier that if any of you fail the exams,
I'll have him step down.
This is for Raiha-chan's sake.
Just to be clear.
I'm counting on you, guys.
Midterms
Midterm exam results!
Curry Day
Library
Hey.
Thanks for gathering here.
What's wrong?
Why so formal?
The midterm results...
Can you teach us the parts we got wrong?
Yeah.
But first, can you show me your results?
Sure thing.
I would prefer not to.
It's personal information.
I absolutely refuse.
Itsuki-chan?
Thanks.
I'm prepared, though.
Tell me how it went.
Nakano Yotsuba Japanese Math Science Social Studies English Total hhhhhh30 hhhhhhhhh09hhhhhhhh18hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh22hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh16 hhhhhhh95
Ta-da.
I guessed right on Japanese and scored a 30.
I've never gotten such grades before!
Nakano Miku Japanese Math Science Social Studies English Total hhhhhh25 hhhhhhhhhh29hhhhhhh27hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 68hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 13 hhhhhh162
I got 68 in social studies.
I just barely failed the rest.
Sucks.

I think that's the best I can do for now.

I failed Japanese, math, science, and social studies.
Just so you know, I was trying my best.
Nakano Itsuki Japanese Math Science Social Studies English Total hhhhhh27hhhhhhhhhh22hhhhhhh 56hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 20hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh23hhhhhh 148
Unfortunately, the science exam was the only one I passed, with 56.
Yay!
Damn it...
It's depressing being reminded of how stupid you all are.
Shut up.
But well, it's so like us to each pass a different subject.
That's true.
And compared to when we scored a hundred combined...
Yeah.
You've certainly made progress.
Miku.
Getting a 68 on an exam as hard as this one is impressive,
even your scores are lopsided.
You can be confident in teaching your sisters what you know.
Yotsuba, you make a lot of careless mistakes.
What a waste.
Stay calm and don't rush things.
Yes, sir.
Ichika.
You need to spend more time on each problem.
Don't give up until the end.
Fine.
Nino.
You never listened to me till the very end.
Don't slack off just because I won't be coming anymore.
Futaro, what do you mean, you won't be coming anymore?
Miku, let's hear him out.
Itsuki...
You're so...
stupidly awkward!
What?!
You obsessed over each question so much, you didn't even answer all of them.
That's something I'm working on.
Just so long as you're aware.
Be careful from now on.
Dad
Incoming call
It's our father.
Hello? Uesugi here.
You were with Itsuki-kun, huh?
I thought I'd ask them each individually, but let's hear it from you.
All right.
I'll know if you lie.
I won't lie.
But I'd like to ask you to find them a better tutor.
In other words, the exam results...
Dad?
It's me, Nino. Can I ask you something?
Why did you give him such a condition?
I have my responsibilities as a father, in leaving you to him.
I was just testing him to see if he's right for you.
So it was for our sake?
Thanks, Dad.
But we won't know whether he's right for us or not from just our grades.
That's the primary metric.
Fine.
Let me tell you, then.
The five of us together avoided failing all five subjects.
Is that true?
I'm not lying.
It must be true if you say so, Nino-kun.
I expect you to keep up the work with Uesugi-kun.
Nino, you just...
The five of us each passed one of the subjects.
So I wasn't lying.
Are you serious?
We ended up deceiving Dad.
It probably won't work again.
You better make it happen for real next time.
Watch me.
Hey, what was that about?
I actually passed all five subjects?!
How?!
Come on...
Don't worry, Miku.
It looks like he'll be with us for a while longer.
Okay!
Let's get to reviewing, then.
I'd rather not, obviously.
No running away.
You're right.
It's most important to study after you get your exam results back.
But it doesn't have to be right after.
A reward, was it?
Something about parfaits?
Futaro-kun just said parfaits!
That's so not his style!
In that case, I'll have an extra large.
That exists?
All right, the five of you passed five together, so just one serving.
What? You're so cheap.
I'll make it happen next time.
By the way, how did you do, Uesugi-san?
No!
Don't look!
Wh-What?! Hundreds on all of them?!
Oh, man, that's embarrassing!
Are you trying to make that your thing?
