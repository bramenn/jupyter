I want to know what this recap tastes like!
Too damn suspicious...
We headed off to Tenroujima
for the S Class Advancement Exam,
but began to suspect that Mest, one of the participants,
isn't actually a member of the guild.
He is far too suspicious!
But approaching the island was an even greater danger!
I want to know this danger!
You're just way too damn suspicious!
I can't believe this.
Zeref alive, and on this island?
And to think that Master Hades of Grimoire Heart and his personal guard are coming here...
He called them the Seven Kin of Purgatory, if I recall.
And he said that one of them was already here on this island.
This is not a good situation. At any rate, we must hurry!
We'll search for Wendy and Mest, then return to the camp!
Hey! What are the two of you doing all of a sudden?
You, stay quiet!
Who exactly are you?
W-What are you talking about?
I suspect you're a wizard whose magic can manipulate people's memories.
You cast a spell on the members of the guild, making them think you were a member.
When you think about Mystogan, everything seems completely out of place.
I can't think of anyone else you have any connection to.
And furthermore, to not know the meaning of the guild's signal flare...
You're not going to talk your way out of this.
He disappeared!
No, it's teleportation magic!
No!
Mest-san?
Wendy!
Makarov's Charge.
Watch out!
An attack?!
What's happening?
He... protected Wendy?
Who are you? Show yourself!
You did well seeing through me...
There's a person coming from the tree!
Who in the world are you?
My name is Azuma.
I am one of Grimoire Heart's Seven Kin of Purgatory.
Grimoire Heart?
A Dark Guild.
So the signal flare before was to warn of incoming enemy attack?
Let's just say you've realized far too late.
What... in blazes is happening?!
I thought if I snuck onto Fairy Tail's holy ground
I would find a skeleton or two in their closet...
But the Black Wizard Zeref and Grimoire Heart's Lady luck is with me for sure...
Zeref?
Who are you?
You haven't realized yet?
I'm from the Magic Council!
I infiltrated Fairy Tail to find dirty secrets to destroy you with...
Magic Council?
But that's...
Well, well...
But, that's come to an end.
With the impossible to find Grimoire Heart coming here...
If I finish you off here, that promotion will be more than a dream!
It looks like I was right to station warships of
the Magic Council's Enforcement and Detention Corps nearby just in case.
We'll round you all up! I'll crush all you devils' hearts!
Warships?
Are you talking about those?
What did he do?
The ships...
Impossible!
Then, let us start again.
Is it acceptable for me to begin my job now, Mr. Official?
Everyone, stand back!
A red signal flare... Signifying an incoming enemy attack...
What have things come to?
Mavis...
Fairy Tail's founding master, Mavis Vermillion...
I have led the enemy here to Fairy Tail's holy grounds...
How far have I failed you?
This is all my responsibility...
I swear I will accept the punishment for this...
So therefore... at least...
I heard like, a big explosion from over there.
Yeah.
Are the enemy here already?
Let's check it out.
Aye!
W-What did he do?
The ships all exploded in an instant!
The Magic Council's warships... Like they were nothing at all...
Lily!
BLEVE.
If I only had a sword...
Lily!
I will support you!
O swift wind that dashes through the heavens!
Vernier!
My body's gotten lighter!
O strength of arm to cleave the heavens!
Is this what they call Support Magic?
Arms!
With this...
Mest-san!
I have a plan.
Please help me!
W-What are you saying?
I'm an official of the Magic Council!
That doesn't matter right now!
I want to protect Fairy Tail!
Please lend me your power!
I came here to destroy your guild so I could be promoted!
I don't care about that!
Because there's no way we'll be destroyed!
Lily!
Fly higher!
Right!
My explosions will reach you, no matter how far you run.
Direct Line!
A point-blank...
Eliminating this guy first is the smart move.
Got you.
Roar of the Sky Dragon!
This is boring.
Tower Burst!
What the heck was that?
A tower of flame?
No one in the guild can use magic like that!
It's gotta be the enemy!
I've hit my limit...
So this is the Seven Kin of Purgatory I've heard rumors of?
Is this guild just filled with cats and children, I wonder?
And there are six more of these guys...
There's no way... for Fairy Tail to win!
Hey! Where's the meeting point again?
It's a portable base.
You didn't hear?
Going through these ruins is a short cut.
Why are we doing this when we should be searching for a grave?
This is ridiculous! Why'd this have to happen now?!
Cana...
Hang in there, Gajeel...
We have to hurry back, or they're going to show up...
Everyone's split up right now...
We're in big trouble if they attack as we are now!
Ultear-san, you're more into this than usual.
Of course. To me as well, this is a war.
Let us go... To the Eden known as battle.
A-And me... Me, too, I'll... that...
Ul, look!
Don't call me Ul.
I-I'm sorry...
Don't go being so nervous!
So? What's wrong, Meldy?
I can see it...
The Fairy's Island...
What's that?
A giant?
You kiddin' me?
Big...
Makarov...
Begone!
736...
48 years earlier...
Me, be the 3rd master of Fairy Tail?
No way! I ain't cut out for it!
You, my boy, can do it.
Don't call me a boy!
I'm already 40!
You love your friends...
You are a human who can believe.
I am sure you will lead a wonderful guild.
From Mavis to me, and now from me to you, Makarov...
I entrust the future of Fairy Tail to you.
You may not pass any further!
Large explosion on the right side!
He shredded our reinforced armor like nothing!
What is this?!
Increase speed!
Magic Beam Cannon, Jupiter...
Our ship!
He's a monster!
This is Makarov?
Ultear!
Yes, Master!
Time Ark...
Restore...
Caprico, take everyone to the island!
And you, Master Hades?
I shall deal with Makarov.
As you wish.
It matters not where you run to!
As is Fairy Tail tradition, I shall count to three before rendering judgment upon you.
The super magic which affects only those whom the caster views as enemies...
One!
Fairy Law, is it?
Two!
What in the world happened?
Wendy, get yourself together!
Hey, Wendy!
Lily, Carla!
Why are the two of you here?
Hang in there...
Damn it... Someone did this to them!
Was it you?
Come on, you bastard!
My memory manipulation magic's worn off?
Memory Manipulation is magic which enables you to alter other people's memories of yourself.
But, like charms, if your real identity is revealed,
the magic is lifted.
Natsu-san... He's a person from the Magic Council.
Nice coat you have there...
Wait... The enemy is the Magic Council?!
Ayiaah!
That's not it...
The enemy is Grimoire Heart.
A Dark Guild!
Grimoire Heart?!
Aren't they one of the three corners of the Dark Guild Baram Alliance?!
What in the world is going on?
I don't know, damn it!
I-I have to...
People are coming from the sky!
The weather forecast didn't say anything about this...
The enemy...
Hold up, give me a break here...
Are those all humans?
They're already here...
As a Man, I will not allow trespassers!
What a pain...
The both of you.
These numbers are nothing to scoff at.
They're still coming down from the sky.
My, my... Here comes the noisy bunch.
I present to you this Fairy sacrifice...
Mission start.
We can meet at last... Zeref...
Is this the start of another war?
Three!
That's it!
Fairy Law!
Stop that.
Grimoire Law.
This magic is a deterrent.
I will not cast it recklessly.
But if you refuse to back down,
then together we shall reach the ultimate of unfortunate ends.
T-T-That's...
It can't be...!
I am heading on a journey.
Make this guild one to be proud of.
Wait, Master!
Master?
You are the master now, Makarov.
It has been a while, boy.
Master... Purehito...
Natsu, do you know about Lost Magic?
Loh-st...? Like, as in chicken?
No, that's roast chicken!
Lost, not roast!
It means magic that's disappeared into history!
Where the heck did you get chicken from?
Magic ain't gonna disappear! This isn't Edolas, after all.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
Next time: Lost Magic!
For some reason, I'm tired out.
Why are you tired when we haven't done anything yet?
Maybe it's because I have to deal with you!
