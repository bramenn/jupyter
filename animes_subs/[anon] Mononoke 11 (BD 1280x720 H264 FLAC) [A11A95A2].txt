Sakai Shoujiro-sama
The blue moon illuminated
your wandering shadow.
I could never tell you all I wanted to say.
It was so very frustrating.
I think about your faked smile,
and forget all the hot tears we shed.
What do these empty husks,
those empty eyes of yours, reflect, my dear?
The transient quarter moon
hides in a rift in the clouds,
as darkness seeps up from the ground.
Tell me the truth, please.
Are you so despondent
that you still sit alone, sighing?
Without you, I just cant smile.
I walk this banal town,
feeling such intense emotions.
I know that if I could treasure them and live on,
I would need nothing else.
The summer flowers that bloomed in the sky
Come falling down, dancing in the wind.
I can barely recall the night sky
where they all came tumbling down,
so what I can still recall is all the more precious.
Ghost Cat
The Second Act
Sakai Shouji ro-sama
Congratulations! You won!
Give it to me!!
- Youll never get it.
The people will not allow this!
If only you would just die!
AAAh! Stop!
TO
STOP
To be continued
Things that are, and things that cannot be,
call out,
and blend together.
They become a Mononoke.
To cut,
to stab,
to gouge,
to carve,
are the duties of the sword.
I must learn the Mononokes name,
its shape,
its Form.
I must learn its state of being, its Truth,
and the state of its mind, its Regret.
Then, my blade will cleanse it of its fate.
A Mononoke who wishes its Truth to be known.
Interesting.
The person who committed suicide,
was it that lady?
Lady?
You mean on that stanchion?
Didnt you all see her?
Isnt that why you were so surprised?
So, thats what you meant when you said there was someone there.
She was standing there, holding the stanchion!
I was so scared when it started moving!
ShShe was dressed like a fashion model!
She was there, holding a cat!
Ichikawa Setsuko?
WhWhat do you mean? Ichikawa didnt have a cat!
Why me? Why? Why?
Cant you see it, sir?
I need the scales,
because I cannot.
Why can only he
Because he saw it.
This Setsuko-sans thoughts brought forth the Ghost Cat.
That, at least, is clear.
That voice
What voice?
I wont forgive you.‚Äù
That was real?
Did anyone else hear the womans voice?
Shes the one who killed herself.
Why do we have to suffer the consequences?
I see.
I see.
Let me out!
Let me out of here!
Please, let me go!
I have to get out of here!
Mayors death, Ghost Cat.
Everyone hid something about Ichikawa Setsukos death.
Death, eh?
WhWhat do you want now?
Dont you mean suicide?
Listen up.
Ichikawa Setsuko threw herself off that bridge to her death.
Thats all there is to it.
Tell me, please,
that I might kill the Ghost Cat.
Oh no! Oh no! I have to get back!
She was hit.
However, I never did believe that she committed suicide.
What are you talking about?
Youre the one who testified she was having trouble at work!
Yes, and she really was having trouble.
She had a good lead, but couldnt follow it through.
No use writing an article with too little information.
Thats why I had to
Sure she didnt just give up on it all?
No, she was determined to rise to the challenge.
She was just a newbie reporter, and a woman to boot, but she had skill!
Her future was incredibly bright.
Say, is there anyone here who saw it happen?
Of course there isnt!
A witness, eh?
At any rate, the case was closed!
There shouldnt be any problem with it.
Even this girl here saw Ichikawa Setsuko looking depressed.
What was it you said, then?
Hm?
Is that so?
Um, well, I
Come on. Spit it out!
The weaker the dog, the louder its bark, eh?
Huh?
Now talk!
WhWhat I said then, was
It couldnt be that it wasnt a suicide, right?
No!
It had to be!
Well, I
It was so long ago.
But you remembered her name, did you not?
Ichikawa Setsuko.
WWell, she was in the newspaper, so of course, I remember.
Im sorry!
Why are you apologizing?
II was just talking to myself, you see.
Maybe shes dead.
Im so sorry!
Why are you apologizing?
BBecause I dont remember too well.
I dont know anything! I saw nothing!
I didnt do it!
I just
Come to think of it, the detective told me something!
Told you what?
That there was someone who saw Setsuko-san walking near the Kirigahara Bridge,
and that was why they were investigating it as a suicide!
But he just said there were no witnesses.
Thats why I thought it was odd.
You just dont understand.
Her shoes were neatly arranged on top of the bridge.
Wait a moment!
Couldnt someone have faked her suicide, though?
Yes, thats right!
You said there was a witness when you came to question me!
Did you ask them leading questions, Kadowaki-san?
What if I did?
Even if I did try to lead them in one direction or another, nobody said anything to contradict me.
You got a problem?
Setsuko-sans death
was a faked
suicide.
That is
the Truth.
What?
Whats going on?
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Help me!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
SSStop!
SSStop!
Were we
rescued?
Thank you, Mr. Driver!
He doesnt look so good.
Open this door immediately!
III didnt
What do you mean?
I dont care!
Just open the door!
Unlike you lot, Ive got work to do.
Why isnt it opening?
Help me!
We can finally go back, now.
Wait. This is
Were home!
Weve got it!
What is this?
A trap!
A trap!
I dont care, as long as we can get off.
You cannot.
Do not leave.
MMayor?
All this is the Ghost Cats doing.
If you leave, your lives will be forfeited.
Help us, Mr. Medicine Seller!
Please!
You seem content to pass comment, without actually helping the situation.
People are dead! We have to get out of here, now!
Whether you get out or not is entirely up to you.
Im not the one who won the raffle.
Why, then? I just got on in his place!
Who did, in fact, win?
Who did, in fact, win?
Well
Id like you all to tell me.
If we assemble all your stories, it will likely form the Regret.
Um, uh, II saw it.
I kept quiet, thinking it wasnt my business.
I was in a hurry and didnt think to stop.
When they said it was a suicide in the newspaper, I figured that was that.
I forgot all about it soon enough.
Man or woman? Which was it?
I dont remember.
If it wasnt a suicide, was it
the culprit?
Masao-kun, you
It itches! It itches!
My eyes hurt! They hurt, but it itches!
I cant see!
He told us
He told us the truth!
Why did it have to take Masao-kun?
How the hell should we know?
It seems like youre all hiding something!
The medicine sellers the only sane one among you!
I dont want to die!
Ichikawa was killed by the mayors attache.
Thats my suspicion.
Oh, the truth at last, eh?
I still dont have any credible evidence.
Thats why I didnt want to say anything.
Why was the mayor involved?
A lot of people had a vested interest in this subways construction.
Everyone, from the government to the construction companies,
were tapping into a veritable river of cash.
Those were the allegations that Ichikawa made.
This is a huge scoop!
We have to let everyone know.
Be patient.
Ill let you publish it, if you track down one more lead.
I cant just let it rot!
You know who were up against. We must be careful.
And then, the night before she died, Ichikawa told me she had incontrovertible evidence.
Even so, I said I was too busy, and turned her away.
If only Id listened then, she might still be alive.
The reason why I came today, abandoning my desk job,
was to trace everything back to the mayor, and avenge her death.
You were involved.
Then, the mayor must have killed Setsuko-san!
Im shocked the mayor would do something like that.
Its a pretty common thing.
What is this?
It itches! It itches! Ah, it hurts!
Three more left.
I need all of you to talk.
I wont!
If Im just going to die, theres no use telling!
Besides, shes the one who lied in the first place!
I wasnt!
You always seemed suspicious to me! Youre too ignorant of what happened!
You didnt see anything at all, did you?
How did you come across this?
How did you come across this?
How did you come across this?
Kinoshita-sans the worst of you!
Hes the one who ran her over!
I told you, I didnt!
I thought it was a cat
What? You knew it was a living thing?
Therere too many cats to stop! I just thought I hit a cat!
Youre terrible!
You didnt even think to check?
If we stopped for every cat on the tracks, wed never keep our schedules!
Even if it was a cat, does life really mean so little to you?
A cats life isnt worth messing up so many peoples schedules for!
Youre awful!
Besides, what about you? Youre the one who said it was a suicide!
Chiyo-chan,
do you know this woman?
Oh, well, I think Ive seen her around.
So, you lied about her being a regular customer!
Well
It looks like the detective is investigating something.
Oh! Maybe I can get into a newspaper, or even a magazine!
You wanted to use the situation for your own personal gain!
Well, I want to be an actress!
I have to be in the papers and stuff to get famous.
Do you really have a face for the stage?
Sakai Shoujiro.
However did you get a hold
of this?
I came in his place.
In his place?
He couldnt come, you see.
Harlot!
I can see your wrinkles, you old harlot!
Even your dead husband wouldnt want you now.
Im no harlot!
Yeah, thats what I want to know!
Then, what the hell were you doing?
You were out all night! Where were you?
Shut up! I dont need to listen to you!
You bastard!
I cant believe you!
Something like that could have been extremely useful!
If only youd told the truth, it wouldnt have been called a suicide!
Poor Setsuko-san!
Tell the truth?
Thats rich, coming from your mouth.
I was close enough to the truth.
You should be arrested for perjury!
I just didnt say anything!
Your crime was the worst of all. Im sure of it!
The mayors the only criminal!
Right, Mr. Medicine Seller?
You were listening well.
My mother-in-law didnt even know I was out!
I couldnt say anything!
You chose your own happiness over truthful testimony?
Thats just wrong!
I dont want to hear it from you!
Put yourself in my shoes!
I had to leave while my mother-in-law was asleep and be back by dawn!
I had to be very careful!
Are you saying I should have just stayed celibate after my damned husband died?
Maybe you should have!
Yeah, right. I saw you eyeing the medicine seller not minutes ago!
What are you talking about?
Cat fights are so ugly.
Oh man, oh man.
Oh man, oh man, oh man.
This is all thanks to you not stopping your damn train!
This is all thanks to you not stopping your damn train!
I was just doing my job!
I didnt stop because I thought it was a cat!
But you did hit Setsuko-san, didnt you?
Shut up!
Oh my.
Theres still more?
Theres still more?
Why dont we
put an end
to this?
