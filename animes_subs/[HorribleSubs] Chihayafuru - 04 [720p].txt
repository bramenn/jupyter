Okay!
That should be all of the large boxes!
Let's go say goodbye to the landlord.
Yeah!
Team Chihaya Furu
The next time we meet will be at the nationals!
Yeah.
Watch me become a Class A player!
You won't beat me next time!
Yeah.
I'm going to become a Master.
I'll be the Queen!
Guess this is it.
Promise!
We'll meet again when we become Class A players!
Yeah.

A Whirlwind of Flower Petals Descends
Verse 4
Chihaya, this is our stop!
Were you daydreaming or something?
Hey, have you been in touch with Arata?
No.
I see.
Arata must be incredibly strong now, right?
Do you think we'll see him at this year's Omi Jingu tournament?
What do you mean?
You want to play against Arata in the national tournament?
Uh-huh.
What class are you right now, anyway?
I made Class B in the tournament during spring break.
At this rate, it'll take you another three years to make Class A.
Why don't you just stick with track?
Instead of hanging around in Class B for three more years...
What was that for?!
You're just as violent as you used to be.
Ta-kun!
You're late!
I came all the way here to show you my uniform!
Sorry.
She calls him Ta-kun?
Ta-kun?
Wanna go somewhere?
Taichi!
If I win the tournament on Sunday and make Class A,
you have to help me start a karuta club!
Wh-What are you talking about?
Do you have any idea how hard it is to make Class A in Tokyo?
Promise!
Hey, wait!
Umm, who is she, Ta-kun?
Hey!
I'll make him pay for getting himself a girlfriend!
I need to tell somebody! Anybody!
She was calling Taichi Ta-kun!

Bunkyo City Otsuka Karuta Memorial Hall
And here I am.
I couldn't forget.
Eye! Eye! Eye!
Eyebrows!
Dr. Harada, I can't believe you actually recognized me.
You've grown so big!
Are your armpits and pubes all bushy now?
But not as bushy as your eyebrows?
Excuse me.
Could you be quiet while they're memorizing the cards.
Oh, my bad.
You already started.
I see. You're here to cheer for Chihaya-chan.
Yeah, I guess.
Looks pretty tense in there.
They have to win if they want to advance to the next class.
Yes, it's especially hard on the Class B players.
There are many strong players who spend years in Class B
because they can't rack up enough wins.
Everyone's trying as hard as they can to reach the next level.
If I win the tournament and make Class A,
you have to help me start a karuta club!
It's gonna take you a while to make Class A.
Eyebrows, I heard that you're in the same high school as Chihaya-chan?
Yes.
There isn't a karuta club, is there?
You should come practice with the Shiranami Society.
No...
Well, I'm thinking about joining the soccer team.
Please be quiet during matches
Eyebrows!
You don't want to turn into a two-timing bastard
or you'll never become a Master!
Stop it.
That's not my goal.
Doctor...
I played karuta in middle school.
It was just a small club, though.
I practiced and became better little by little,
but I always knew, deep down,
that I could spend my entire youth on karuta
without ever becoming better than Arata.
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
They're starting.
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
So spring ends...
Yes!
Why is she yelling?
Did you teach her to do that?
Not under normal circumstances,
but I gave her a few tips since she wanted to win so badly.
If someone challenges her, she's supposed to complain
loud enough that everyone in the room can hear.
The hazy early morning light comes not from the moon
The point is to overwhelm her opponent.
Is she really so obsessed with winning?
When Chihaya-chan entered middle school...
Why track?
There a reason for choosing that.
You know how you're supposed to start running when you hear the starter pistol fire?
It reminds me of karuta.
Huh?
It'll also help me get in shape.
Everything is for karuta.
Spend your entire youth without becoming stronger?
Eyebrows,
hold that thought for now.
The night was young...
Yes!
She's made it past the third round!
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
I apologize for raising my voice during the match.
What?
An okay sign?
That's the chocolate sign.
Chocolate sign?
Eyebrows, run down to the convenience store
and buy some chocolate!
Huh? What?
Hurry! Go!
Temporarily Closed Sorry!!
I don't believe this.
Convenience my foot!
Are there any other shops around here?
Go-Godi
Temporarily Closed Sorry!!
Temporarily Closed Sorry!!
Hey!
Savor them, will you?!
Don't eat three of them at once!
These are good, Taichi.
So many different flavors!
Karuta tournaments are long and grueling.
You have to memorize the positions of fifty cards,
then forget them.
Memorize, then forget.
The longest tournaments require you to play seven matches,
from morning till night, before there can be a winner.
Your brain will burn through the sugar in your body,
and you can lose up to three kilograms.
So players eat chocolate to recharge themselves.
Right, Chihaya-chan?
Anyway, you've gotten a lot better.
I was actually surprised.
Huh?
She's already asleep?!
What's scary is that Chihaya-chan sleeps with her eyes open,
Open
but that's what I like about her.
You're so kind, Taichi.
I-I'm just making sure that nobody has to see your ugly mug.
You're so kind...
Taichi.
Hmm?
Sorry about forcing you into making a karuta club with me.
But watch.
I'm going to win, so watch me.
Eyebrows, we're allowed to watch the final match inside.
I'll pass. I can't do anything if I'm inside.
Then I'll join you outside.
I'm already sick of looking at her opponent, Yasuda-kun's face.
However, he will be a formidable foe.
He has the ability, but he's been stuck in Class B for three years.
He's fired up this time.
I dare say that his card positioning is perfect.
Yasuda-san's gonna win this.
I don't see him losing to some random high school girl.
Just look at the way he's spreading out the cards
that start with the same syllables.
How many cards will he beat her by?
the red that is the Tatsuta River
Team Chihayafuru
Please be there for me.
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Okay.
Let's do this.
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
In order to restore...
The emotions experienced after a long-awaited reunion
Im
the red that is the Tatsuta River
passioned vows exchanged over many a tear shed to last
until the day waves crash over Mount Suenomatsu
As soon as he heard Im, he went for the
Impassionate gods card on the opposite side.
Once he heard it was Impassioned vows,
he switched to the correct card on his own side.
Yasuda-kun is known for his precise aggression.
He's putting pressure on Chihaya-chan, since she usually starts slow.
Chihaya.
I know you well, Ayase Chihaya-chan.
Impassionate is your best card.
Once I've taken away your favorite card,
it will be easy to break your 15-year-old spirit.
until the day waves crash over Mount Suenomatsu
But I don't want to look her in the eyes.
Since I could not hide...
Yes! She took a card from the opponent's side!
the red that is the Tatsuta River
Doctor, she gave him the Chihaya card.
It makes perfect sense, Eyebrows.
Huh?
I teach aggressive karuta.
The objective is to take cards from the opponent's side.
But isn't it risky to give a strong opponent her best card?
That's the one card Chihaya-chan will always win.
I'm going to win, so watch over me,
Taichi,
Arata!
All alone...
That was fast!
Wow.
Would the mountain...
the red that is the Tatsuta River
He passed it back!
As the first frost...
the red that is the Tatsuta River
My fear is that you...
the red that is the Tatsuta River
They keep passing around the Chihaya card.
Yasuda-kun is being really stubborn.
I guess he doesn't want to let Chihaya-chan have an advantage.
The sight of the lonely...
Such intensity!
That girl is holding her own against Yasuda-san!
While autumn leaves...
I feel that my...
He took another card!
the red that is the Tatsuta River
Chihaya...
Huh?
He's good.
And that's not all...
He truly loves karuta!
Since the dew atop...
For you, I would have given...
A mountain village...
It looks fun.
It looks like you're having fun, Chihaya.
Is it because you're the one who's playing?
Was it fun because we were the ones you were playing with?
the red that is the Tatsuta River
are joined at river's end
Impassionate gods...
the red that is the Tatsuta River
She beat him!
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much.
Let's play!
Let's play karuta, Taichi!
Let's play!
We can improve together!
If we have each other, we can become strong!
Okay. Stay right here, Taichi.
Huh?
It's okay for me to call Arata now, right?
Huh?
I have to tell him that I made Class A.
Arata...
Arata, guess what?
Listen up, Arata.
Hello, this is Wataya.
Arata?!
It's me, Chihaya!
Ayase Chihaya!
Taichi's also here!
I made Class A today!
I worked so hard!
There are so many things...
Taichi and I are at the same high school!
He got himself a girlfriend who calls him Ta-kun!
Can you believe it?
Oh, Dr. Harada's doing great!
Hey, Arata...
How strong are you now?
Could you stop?
Sorry, but don't call me again.
I stopped playing karuta.
Huh?
What did Arata say?
Hey, Chihaya?
the red that is the Tatsuta River
My dream is to become
a karuta Master.
I-I won't let anyone take a single card off me.
I wouldn't show mercy if I were playing a 5-year-old.
Thank you for playing karuta with me!
Chihaya, Taichi...
I stopped playing karuta.
I always thought that the three of us would be reunited.
I thought that we would never change.
