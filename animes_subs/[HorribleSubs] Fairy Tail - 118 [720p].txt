Laxus...
Laxus has come for us!
That person is the Master's grandson?
Brat.
Related to Makarov, are we?
Pitiful...
Looks like this guy totally wiped the floor with all of ya.
No kidding.
Why are you here?
Came to visit the founder's grave.
I used to be in Fairy Tail, if you remember.
I came here to visit Mavis's grave.
And looky what I found... The 2nd master's here, too.
Since you're here and all, maybe I'll make you a grave, too!
The Man Without the Mark!
Hmph. Honestly, now.
Never thought the boy would have such a stuck-up grandkid.
You move fairly well.
And that magic power, too.
To think the boy had someone other than Gildarts at this level.
It don't matter how strong the guy is.
What's more important is standing up to him.
Ain't that right, Natsu?
Laxus.
Foolishness.
Sounds like the excuse of a weakling to me.
You've had a chance to warm up, yes?
Now come at me, youngster!
This'll be fun.
If there's even a small gap in the defensive runes, they lose all purpose.
It's crucial they are precise.
Make sure to check the fine details as you fill them in.
Right!
This time, I'll protect you, Gajeel.
Did you say something?
If you have something to say, then say it loud and clear.
It's not that!
You should really lie down again, Elf-niichan.
I've rested plenty.
I could at least stand watch...
You were crying out in your sleep, Elf-niichan.
Eva! Eva!...
Aw, I was just kidding!
Man, you guys are sure takin' it easy.
Easy, easy!
And where the hell were you?
I got rid of the glasses guy who was out for the count.
If he had some kind of Body Link, he'd have given away our position.
Good work with that.
We will proceed along.
You've taken some damage, too.
Maybe you could rest a bit?
When I think about how they gotta feel, invading enemy territory, this ain't nothin'.
Stab
What?
That's...
They're...
Heavy Egg Rain!
A sneak attack?
Looks like we've already been traced.
These guys should have been defeated by Gajeel!
That's not fair!
Zuzazazazaza...
Though I lost my sword, that does not change the manner of my battle!
The runes!
Protect the wounded!
I'll fight, too!
But you can't!
Master Hades will be angry if we stay defeated!
And that's not all!
Thanks to all the damage you guys have done...
we'll definitely get promoted into the 7 Kin of Purgatory-pero!
They...
Wait.
We have to restore the runes, first!
But...
How long are you gonna stay down?
We're counting on you!
Leave it to me!
Go, my babies!
Seith Magic?
In that case...
Defense
Ow!
That hurts, damn it!
What's with this guy? He's super-hard!
That's'cause I've already Self-Strengthened.
But I thought Happy stole that doll!
I have a spare, of course!
His name is Mr. Cursey 2!
2?
Plus, I haven't missed a beat and I already stole one of you guys' hairs.
Oh, no!
Don't go freaking out just yet.
I can learn from my past losses at battle.
Change Mr. 2 to be made of iron!
Huh?
Now then, if you want to get back together with me, you just need to say so.
What? I don't get you!
Then I have no choice.
Metallic Rocket Mr. 2!
What?!
Elf-niichan?!
Dodge me, Lisanna!
Oh, such beautiful love between brother and sister!
A lot of girls tell me they want to be my little sister.
Well, putting that aside...
Yes, I am one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory.
But I will still use my full strength to destroy weaklings like you.
We can't lose...
How could we?!
Because... we're Fairy Tail!
Man, Romeo hasn't come back yet?
He's tagging along with Al and Bisca on a job.
They better not have ditched him and started makin' out or something!
Those two?
Not a chance.
But, anyway...
We've got more people than ever.
Well, can't say I'm surprised.
We're getting more famous, and the number of jobs we've got has increased correspondingly.
Just look at all these requests!
Like it matters to you, Mr. I Never Go on a Job.
It is something to see!
For I have completed a new dance!
I name it, the Dance of Greatest Power!
Yeah, sure. Good job there.
Hey, Droy... Are you still stuffing yourself?
No problem! I can eat all I want and stay thin!
Laki, how long has it been?
I had a bunch of long-term jobs in a row.
You keep pigging out like that, and you're gonna get like Reedus!
Oui. I'm large because of magic, that's all.
Dad, I'm back!
You're late, Romeo!
Damn it... Lately you keep goin' on every job you can!
Well, he's a wizard's son, all right!
Although he don't take after his dad, that's for sure.
Lay off it!
Aww...
It's boring without Natsu-nii and the others.
You want to become like Natsu, don't you, Romeo?
But without them, no matter how many people are in the guild...
Yeah. Definitely kind of quiet.
S Class wizards, the strongest team... Dragon Slayers...
They're now the top in Fiore, aren't they?
Without them, we're...
Yup, nice and quiet.
S Class, huh?
I wonder if there is some job that only I can do? That's perfect for me, up there?
How about you choose one of the ones you're staring at, first!
How many years have you been standing there?
Wow, the S Class Exam...
I wonder how it's going?
All of them are really great this year.
By the way, why did Wendy go?
She was someone's partner, right?
Wait, no... There were only 7 this year.
Getting up in years?
Forgotten who the candidates were again?
You think Natsu-nii can become S Class?
When I grow up, I'm gonna become an S Class wizard for sure!
Hold it there, buddy.
You'd better become a wizard first!
Right! I'm all fired up!
We're not going to get anywhere searching all together.
Let's split up and search.
Yes! Carla is exactly right!
Split up...
You mean alone?
You scared?
Absolutely not!
We're splitting up!
Right... Sorry...
Here, perhaps?
Who designed this crazy ship?
I'm not scared... I'm not scared...
This is suspicious.
I see... Came up empty?
Ah, well.
Let's all move further on.
R-Right...
You little...
You can take a hit, I'll give you that.
We wouldn't be Grimoire Heart if we didn't pay you back tenfold for what you did to us!
Soon, we will finish you off!
Ready?
Who goes there?
Give me a friggin' break.
You busted up the exam, hurt my friends...
You targeted wounded who couldn't move!
We're the ones who gotta pay you back, big time!
Head to Lisanna.
The runes are done with?
I have completed a minimal defense.
But the next step is eliminating these two.
Here we go.
Roger that.
I see. You're not in the leadership, but you did manage to injure Gajeel that severely...
The two of them attack together... It's a real pain!
Hang in there, Elf-niichan!
Listen carefully, Lisanna.
The way to fight a wizard that changes their element back and forth is to work as a team!
You might not be a match alone, but together there's a chance!
I have a bad feeling about this!
This is an Amaterasu formation...!
Scatter and fall!
Crap!
Those who are hit by it lose all power in their limbs,
and it is impossible for them to move at all.
Even if you defend against it, your magic power will be wiped out.
Whoa!
Laxus... Were you this strong?
That power was just from one leg.
I've got another one.
And both my arms!
I have my head, and my entire body.
If I attack with all of them at once, we're not talkin' two or three times stronger...
Wanna try me?
Nice speech!
Is this the confidence of youth?
But youth is not what is needed to walk the path of magic!
Youth is...
Nonsense!
Not going to work.
I, a pure soul, will never fall for your attempts to seduce me.
Who said I was...
Now then, it's about time to finish you off.
I will end it quickly in an instant, so that you do not feel pain...
Cana!
That's hot! You burnt my bristle!
You there, marshmallow man! Time to take you down a peg!
Who you callin' a marshmallow?!
Card Magic, Summoned Lightning!
H-He's...
Are you another one that's fallen for my manliness?
I don't have a particular type of girl I like.
I take all comers.
Huh?
And my attack isn't working.
Change Mr. Cursey 2 to electric power!
Self-Strengthen, lightning!
You're a real pain, aren't you?
Not fast enough!
With my Self-Strengthening, I can dodge that easily!
Prayer's Fountain!
Cotton is sucking up the water, and getting heavy!
Here comes the next one!
Ice Lance!
Self-Strengthen, heat!
What an exchange... Cana is really something!
So this is what it takes to be a candidate in the S Class Wizard Exam?
I'm at a loss when I have two of you approaching me so fervently...
I guess it's my time to be popular, yes?
Honestly, this might be a problem.
You've been doing this shtick on purpose, haven't you?
Sorry to make you wait, everyone!
Levy!
With the three of us, we can handle this somehow!
The three of you can what?
What's this?
You're going to fight me three on one?
Being confessed to by three girls at the same time!
Seriously, how popular am I all of a sudden?
But! I am awkward!
And I'm a manly man, as you can see!
A serious relationship should be one on one!
So which one of you is it going to be? Speak up!
No thanks.
I'm not sad at all!
I knew you were going to say that!
I totally did!
Solid Script: Hole!
Explosion!
Penguin!
Huh?
Lisanna, that's...
Why are you there, Elf-niichan?
H-Heavy...
This is the forbidden double-Self-Strengthen!
My replacement, Mr. Cursey 3!
Using my hair and his hair, I can change bodies at will!
And on myself, Self-Strengthen with mist!
Now I am impervious to all physical and secondary attacks!
Runes?
When did you...
We figured this might happen, so Fried placed a number around earlier.
This is a rune trap that makes it impossible to use magic. Activated!
Nice!
When it comes to piling on, leave that to us!
Right, here we go!
Lisanna!
Okay!
Explosion on the right and storm on my left!
Triple Unison Explosion!
What? My second loss in a row?
That's totally lame!
Looks like we just got another promotion-pero.
Good! This is good!
We've got an even better chance of moving up-pero!
They're happy because their comrade got defeated?
They're a Dark Guild, after all.
We cannot understand how they think.
Two left.
Let's clean them up!
Oh? What's the matter?
It's a little too soon to be bending knee to me after the boasting you just did.
Laxus!
Wait, don't tell me...
He got hit by that magic earlier!
The world... sure is vast.
To think there'd be monsters like this in the world...
I've got a long way to go.
What the hell are you saying?!
Get it together, Laxus!
You've done well, Laxus fellow.
But that ends now. You shall now disappear!
Stand up, Laxus!
But I'm...
Dodge it!
You can't let yourself be hit by that!
Laxus!
It's okay to get pissed...
Hell yeah, it is!
Laxus's lightning!
Laxus!
My anger... Natsu.
Natsu-san?
Thanks for... the meal.
Electrified?
That's all of my magic power.
What?
He gave his magic power to Natsu?
Wait, that means...
He ate lightning?
I heard he got sick from it the last time...
Laxus... He took that blow without any magic power at all!
That's just how much he wanted to give Natsu-san his magic power?
Why... to me...?
I'm... weaker than Laxus...
It ain't about bein' strong or weak.
Who was it that got hurt?
It's gotta be someone with the mark of the guild, damn it!
It's the guild that'll pay him back for the pain suffered by the guild!
100 times over.
Yeah.
A fusion of flame and lightning.
The Thunder-Flame Dragon!
It's payback... times 100.
Thunder-Flame Dragon? Isn't that acting a little bit too cool for you, Natsu?
It ain't acting, you know.
It's not fair that I can't have something similar.
If you had lightning powers, Happy, wouldn't you just be a Flying Lightning Cat?
Lightning Cat?
That's like, so totally cool!
Next time: The Deepest Realm
It's something that Lily, who's scared of lightning, could never handle...
This way, my character's uniqueness is secure!
Oh, so that's what you're worried about...
