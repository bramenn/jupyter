After crossing the grassland,
our heroes find themselves in the Safari Zone
where wild Pokemon roam free, just waiting to be captured.
Mankey! Mankey! Mankey! Mankey!
Wow, this place is like a dream. Pokemon wherever you look.
It must be the Safari Zone.
Let's start catching them.
-Wait a minute, Ash. -We might still be in the Pokemon reserve.
This has to be the Safari Zone. Just take a look at all these Pokemon.
Ah, it's Chansey! Here's my chance.
I'm going to catch it.
-Freeze! Drop that Poke Ball. -
My name is Jenny, safari ranger.
You're under arrest for Pokemon poaching.
-Under arrest? -Pi, Pikachu.
This is a national Pokemon preservation area.
It's here for the raising and protection of Pokemon.
I'm real sorry. I didn't know that.
Well, you look like you really didn't know,
so I'm going to let you go with a warning this time.
Oh, thank you.
Well, that's so nice of you, Ranger Jenny.
Well, I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Huh?
Another poacher!
Let us help you out, Jenny.
We want to make up for what happened before.
-Thanks. Get on in. -Right.
There they are. We hit the jackpot.
Kangaskhan parent and child Pokemon.
All right, you guys, time to get to work.
Prepare for trouble.
Make it double.
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above...
-Jessie. -James.
While you two are standing around reciting poetry,
the Kangaskhan are going to get away. Come on, hurry up!
-Be quiet, Meowth. -We know what to do without you yelling.
We have to say our poem or it just doesn't feel right.
Now stand aside and watch us work.
What are you doing?
We're trying to catch the Pokemon, not blast them.
Keep quiet and watch.
Kangaskhan. A parent Pokemon.
Once approaching extinction,
they are now protected by law and inhabit the Safari Zone.
Approach with extreme caution.
The Kangaskhan is a rare Pokemon, which raise its children in its pocket.
They will attack viciously and without warning
if they feel their young are threatened in any way.
Wow.
Fire.
-Hey, what's that? -Over there! Poachers.
- - It's Team Rocket.
We've got to stop them.
I'm afraid if we're going to stop them, we're going to have to run away first.
What?
-Huh? -Ah! What's that?
Kangaskhan are easily scared,
but once they're surprised, they never stop charging.
That's it. Charge right into our net.
Look at all the mighty Kangaskhan we've caught in our trap.
-Well, well, which one shall I pick? -That parent and child sure look nice.
We can't let Team Rocket get away with this.
Pikachu.
Ah! Look at those poor baby Kangaskhan.
Quick, Jenny, we have to do something to save them.
It's no good. I overheated the engine on the last stunt.
Huh?
Kanga!
I claim this Pokemon for Team Rocket.
Who did that? Who's out there?
Kanga!
What's that sound?
Kanga! Kangas!
Kangas! Kang!
Kangas, kangas.
Kangas, Kangaskhan.
What does that little savage think he's doing?
You can't have them! We caught them.
Kangas, kangas, kang!
I don't like the way they're looking at us.
They're staring straight at us.
Quit yapping and let's get out of here fast.
Kangas, kang!
Kanga!
Kangaskhan!
Team Rocket's blasting off again!
Kangaskhan!
Kangas, Kangaskhan!
Kangaskhan! Kangaskhan! Kangaskhan!
That's amazing how he can command all of those Kangaskhan
just by yelling like that.
Hm, yeah. He's very good.
Just a kid, but he could become a famous Pokemon trainer.
I hear something.
- -Huh?
Oh! Who's that?
Greetings. Please excuse the noise.
-Are you the Safari Zone Pokemon ranger? -Yes.
Let me introduce myself. I'm Tommy's father.
I came here because I heard that someone had seen my son, Tommy,
in this area.
Your son, Tommy, is here in the Safari Zone?
Papa, I think we have to tell them a little more about Tommy.
Of course. You're right. Forgive me.
-Right. -Sure.
You can explain the rest back at the station.
A splendid idea.
It happened five years ago.
Tommy was only three years old when we decided take him with us
-on a family trip around the world. -That's correct.
Mankey! Mankey! Mankey!
See, Tommy, look at all the Pokemon down there.
-Here, take a closer look. -Papa, be careful!
Don't worry, my dear. Tommy's having such a good time.
- -Oh! Oh, Tommy!
Don't worry about him, Mama. He just wants to get a closer look.
What a smart boy our Tommy is.
There's nothing but a parachute left.
Maybe if you had been holding him, this wouldn't have happened.
It's your fault!
Ever since that day, we've searched high and low,
but we can't find him anywhere.
Pika.
Quit that, Pikachu. You're going to make me cry too.
It's just like Papa said.
We looked as hard as we could but couldn't find him anywhere.
Then someone sent us a picture of a young boy
who leads a huge pack of Kangaskhan here in the Safari Zone.
I always knew that this day would come. Someone was bound to see Tommy somewhere.
I know it's a bother,
but would you consider helping us in our search?
We'll do anything.
Here's the picture.
If Tommy is still alive, he would be just about this age.
Ah, you mean Tomo. You won't have to look far.
His address is listed right here in the Safari Zone directory.
Really? Thank goodness.
We saw him out in the jungle just before you came.
My friends and I'd be glad to help you find him if you want us to.
Pika, pi.
-Oh, please let us help you. -It would be our pleasure.
Thank you all so much.
Now we can finally be united with our son and live together as a family.
Ah, it's lovely riding through the jungle like this.
How'd we end up with a job like this?
It's because you had to go and volunteer us all.
You're the one who said: Oh, please let us help you.
Why did we have to go and open our big mouths?
I apologize for this.
Papa doesn't get outdoors much, and he's not in the best of shape.
I admit it.
Pika. Pika?
Wait, what's that?
Huh?
Ow! My lumbago. Ow!
-A baby Kangaskhan. -It looks like it's injured.
-Leave it to me. -Can you treat it, Brock?
Don't forget, Ash, I've been studying to be the world's best Pokemon breeder.
You'll be just fine.
This'll sting a little, but it'll make your wound heal faster. I promise.
-Look out behind you! -Huh?
-Pika, pi! -Tomo!
You hurt Kangaskhan. That bad.
No, we didn't.
Brock was just trying to help the baby Kangaskhan because it's hurt.
That is, until you threw your boomerang at him.
Now apologize!
Uh, what's the matter?
You people or Pokemon?
Ah!
I'm a person, you creep!
Hurry, my dear. It sounds like they may have found our Tommy.
Huh? Who you, old man?
I am Papa, this is your mama, and you are our son, Tommy.
Tommy, come home with your mommy and daddy.
They Pokemon or peoples?
They're peoples... Uh, people!
Tommy these two people are your parents. Your mother and father.
They've been looking for you for a very long time.
Mother? Father?
It's no good, Ash. He doesn't know them.
He was only three when they were separated.
Take a good look. Try to remember.
This is your mother and your father, and your real name is Tommy.
Think back, Tommy. Try to remember, Tommy.
-Tommy. -Do you know me, son?
Do you remember them now, Tommy?
Tomo mama Kangaskhan! Mama Kangaskhan!
-What are you doing, Papa? -He'll be fine.
We'll just take him home and start from scratch.
Look what you've done to him.
Tommy, can you hear me? Tommy.
Tommy. Tommy!
Tommy, my little boy.
Mama. Mama!
Tommy. Tommy! Tommy.
-Are you all right, Tommy? -Mama.
Tommy. Oh, my little boy remembers me.
That clonk on the head must have helped bring your son's memory back.
Tommy, my boy, remember Papa?
Doh!
One memory at a time, okay, Papa?
Forgive us, Tommy. You must have been so lonely.
We'll never be separated again. Now let's go home.
Your mother and your father have been looking all over for you
for years, Tommy.
I know it's going to be hard to leave the Kangaskhan, Tommy,
but wouldn't it be a whole lot better to live with your real parents?
Sometimes, the real parent's the one who raises you,
but this is a real unusual situation.
Tomo mama Kangaskhan, but this lady Tomo mama too.
You can't live with both of them, Tommy.
Kangaskhan mama too! This lady mama too!
Tommy head feel bad.
Tommy. Huh?
I need your help. Someone's poaching Kangaskhan again.
Kanga, Kangaskhan!
Tommy!
Come on, let's go.
Kanga!
Tommy must feel that those Kangaskhan are his real parents after all.
He's completely turned into Tomo.
I guess we'll have to give up.
Don't say that, Mama. Deep down, Tommy is still our boy.
Papa.
Yes?
All right, let's get this show on the road.
Now I will present my impression
of an injured Kangaskhan for your enjoyment.
Kangaskhan! Kangaskhan!
Kangaskhan! Kangaskhan!
Kangaskhan! Kangaskhan!
Kangaskhan, kangas.
They're headed this way. They can't tell it's a fake.
Our plan's a success. We're finally getting our Pokemon.
James, put the Kangaskhan to sleep, and we'll round them all up!
Firing tranquilizer.
Kangaskhan.
Now's our chance. Let's get our new Kangaskhan.
Kanga!
You bad Kangaskhan.
Tomo angry!
Kangaskhan?
-It's jungle boy. -He ruined our plan last time.
This time, let's show him who's boss.
Rocket punch.
That Team Rocket. We got to stop them.
Bulbasaur, I choose you.
Bulbasaur!
Bulbasaur, quick. Use your vine whip now!
Bulbasaur!
Squirtle, I choose you.
Squirtle, Squirtle.
Squirtle, go! Give them your skull bash attack.
Squirtle! Squirt!
Kanga!
Kanga, kanga, Kangaskhan!
-All that banging is giving me a headache. -This ought to fix that.
Kanga, kanga, kanga!
Huh?
You've been a bad boy.
Tommy! Pikachu.
Pika.
Charmander, I choose you.
Char!
Pikachu, Charmander, thunder shock and flamethrower.
-Pikachu! -Char!
Kanga!
-Great! -Tomo do it!
-Oh, no! -Get in quick!
They think they have us beat, do they?
Let's give them a taste of our super punch.
One super punch coming right up.
Huh?
Don't worry! We're coming to save you, Tommy!
Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again.
Tommy's parents saved us all.
They sacrificed themselves so they could save their son's life.
They really loved him.
Pikachu.
You are my little Tommy
Huh?
Tommy, your father and I decided that if you love the Kangaskhan so much,
we'll stay here and protect the Pokemon with you.
Let Mama and Papa join your family, Tommy.
Huh?
Papa. Mama.
We'll be together from now on, Tommy.
Good.
Do you think Tommy and his parents really can be a family?
Ash, they love each other. They'll be just fine.
It might be tough, though. After all, they were apart for five years.
And it's going to be hard for them even to communicate.
Pikachu.
Pika? Pika, pika!
Huh?
Kangas, kangas, Kangaskhan!
Kangas, kangas, Kangaskhan!
-I think you're right, Brock. -Like I said, they'll be just fine.
Kanga, Kangaskhan!
Seeing the happy family reunited,
Ash remembers his own mother waiting patiently for him in Pallet.
But now our heroes journey on,
eager for more new adventures and more new Pokemon.
Kangas, kangas, Kangaskhan!
I guess like son like father.
