Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
I knew it! You don't even know your Zanpaku-tos name.
And you think you can fight me as an equal?
Well, it's 2000 years too soon!
Roar! Zabimaru! Look in front of you!
What stands before you is
your prey!
It's all over, punk!
You will lose to Renji Abarai, and die on this spot!
BLEACH 17
Sorry, kid.
But that's what's known as a difference in strength.
The Zanpaku-to changes in size and shape
depending on its wielder's spiritual energy.
And this is the manifestation of my spiritual energy!
Well kid, I think it's about time I got going.
I don't like the air here.
One attack will show him the difference in strength,
make him realize that he has no chance,
and back down while his wound is not serious.
That was my hope.
But Ichigo would never give up because of such a reason.
I knew that.
Are you ready?
Can you still move, Ichigo? Then run!
Please, hurry!
No answer?
Run!
What are you doing, Rukia?!
Hey! Let go!
Are you trying to deepen your guilt?! Let go, you fool!
Run, Ichigo!
Stand! Stand and run!
Ichigo!
What? You still have the strength to move?
Fine. I was just thinking that it's no fun
to finish off someone who can't move anymore.
Well then, fight hard and die!
Ichigo, if you can stand, get away! Run, Ichigo!
Ichi-?!
What's the matter?
If you won't attack, I will!
What is this sudden increase in his Spiritual Pressure!
What the hell?!
What's with this kid?!
He was about to die earlier! Where'd he get all this power?
What's wrong?
Your moves have slowed down considerably.
Idiot! You just got faster!
I don't understand this, but it feels good.
I don't even feel the pain from the wound!
And I don't feel like I can lose!
Why you-!
Roar, Zabimaru!
Renji is being pressured! Ichigo?
You're good at dodging around!
What's happening?!
How much higher can his spiritual energy go?!
But that's about to end.
Heavy
I won't make it in time
W-What the-?!
My Zanpaku-to
No he didn't do anything.
Was it him?
Impossible
He can't do a thing from that distance.
Huh?!
Is he coming?
What happened just now?
Did he get me?
I can't even tell if I was hit from the back
or the front.
It hurts
You're slow.
Even when you fall.
Brother Byakuya!
It's been awhile since I saw it, but he's awesome, after all.
I had to strain to follow his second attack.
But his first one
I couldn't even tell
when he drew his sword, or put it back.
If I couldn't see it coming
He probably doesn't even know what happened to him.
Still
What was that extraordinary Spiritual Pressure he demonstrated earlier?
What's the matter, Renji?
No You didn't need to help me with a kid of this level, Captain.
Don't say that. If all I did was watch each time
I'd get rusty.
No, this man is And I am
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Stop!
Let go, Renji! Ichigo is
What are you saying, fool?! Look hard!
The kid is dead!
Don't you understand?!
By just touching him, your sentence will increase by 20 years!
Why would you multiply your crimes for a dead person?!
I'm the one who got Ichigo involved in this.
It's my fault he's dead!
So what's wrong with my coming to him?!
So even if it would make your sentence harsher,
you can't stay away... from this kid?
Brother
I understand, Rukia.
This kidlooks a lot like him.
I understand, Rukia.
This kidlooks a lot like him.
He's dead, you say? Looks a lot like him?
Quit talking about me like I'm not here!
Ichi-!
Let go.
I can't hear you. Look at me when you speak!
This kid can still move?! No way!
I see You don't need that arm, huh?
Huh?!
W-What're you doing, Rukia?!
You're just a human
You're just a human!
How dare you grab my brother like that?!
Know your place, kid!
Let us go, Brother!
Through his actions just now I, Rukia Kuchiki, have opened my eyes.
Please take me back to the Soul Society.
I will atone for my sins.
Wait you! What're you saying?!
Rukia, you!
You don't know when to give up, do you?
Quit squirming around and die!
There is no need to inflict the final blow upon him.
Leave him and he will eventually die on his own.
Let us go, Brother.
Wait, Rukia!
What kind of joke is this?! Look at me, hey!
Hey!
Do not move!
Take even one step from there
Try to come after me...
And I'llI'll
I will never forgive you!
You will die anyway
so stay there and live, even if just one second longer.
Fine. I will not inflict the finishing blow.
With the two attacks just now, I've shattered his Soul Chain
and Hakusui - Soul Sleep, the vital spots of the soul.
He should die in less than an hour.
And even if he does survive, his powers will be lost,
Soul Reaper power, as well as his spiritual energy.
Renji...
Yes.
Open!
I can't speak
I can't move
I was protectedagain
Rukia!
It hurts. My body feels heavy.
It's cold.
It doesn't hurt. Oh no, am I about to die?
I probably don't feel pain because I'm on the verge of death.
That's right my body was so cold earlier, but I'm feeling warmth now.
It's warm.
Oh, good reaction! That's good.
Y-You're too close!
Boss! Kurosaki is awake!
Boss!
I've seen you before! You're Hat-and Clogs friend!
Why are you under the covers with me?!
Get off!
Huh?!
Huh? I'm not dead?! Why?
And this isn't my house.
Where am I?
Now, now. You mustn't be up, Kurosaki.
Your wounds haven't closed yet.
You'll die if you move around too much.
Hat-and-Clogs?
I see. So this is your house.
Correct!
So you saved me?
Huh? That tone is unexpected.
It sounds as though you didn't want me to rescue you.
Oh yeah Ishida was there, too.
What happened to him? Is he here, too?
No, he went home.
He lost a lot of blood, but his wounds weren't too serious.
Even if he lay there like that,
he wouldn't have died for a couple of days.
So I was able to treat most of his wounds there.
He was worried about you when he left.
Ishida? No way!
I asked him to rest here awhile
Thank you very much. But I'm all right.
But rather please take care of Kurosaki.
If there's anyone who can defeat those guys right now, it's not me.
The only one who can save Rukia
Only me?
What does he expect me to do?
Rukia has gone back to the Soul Society!
How do I go after her?! How do I save her?!
No way can I do that
No way!
Do you really believe that?
There's a way to get to the Soul Society
Is there a way?
How? How do I get there?! Tell me!
Of course, I'll tell you. But there's one condition.
Condition?
Yes. For the next ten days, study how to fight with me.
S-Study?! What? You want me to train?
I don't have time!
Rukia may be executed over there at any time!
We have to get to the Soul Society and!
You just don't get it, do you?
Huh?!
What I mean is, if you go there now, you will die.
Can you beat them? If you fought with them now?
This time, I let you try and fight them.
That's because I figured you would understand that better than words.
With your level of strength now,
you won't be of any good in the Soul Society.
You are weak.
A weak person entering the enemy's den that's called suicide.
You want to save Rukia? Don't make me laugh.
Don't use others as a reason for walking straight into death's arms.
The Soul Society usually
has a one-month waiting period before an execution.
This holds true in Rukia's case, too.
Execution?
It's different from the way humans are executed, though.
I have ten days to bully you.
Then seven days to open the gate to Soul Society.
And 13 days after we arrive in Soul Society.
We will have lots of time.
Can I become stronger in ten days?
Certainly! That is if you truly wish to save Rukia from the bottom of your heart.
Your feelings are stronger than steel.
Abandon any doubt you have.
Ten days. Can you play a game of life and death with me?
Of course!
I felt as thoughthe rain stopped.
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I dont know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move
hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
Youre not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
