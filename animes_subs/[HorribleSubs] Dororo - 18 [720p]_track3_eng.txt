No!
Dang...
Dammit...
Dororo, your back.
Warm her back by the fire.
Let go! Itachi...
No, don't look!
So that's how you hid it, Dororo.
Let's go.
Damn it...
Get back here, Itachi!
That's Papa's precious money...
What's that?
Jiromaru...
Jiro... maru...
Saburomaru...
How it must've hurt.
How it must've pained you.
Those bastards...
I'll kill them all.
Jiromaru, eat them all up!
Betrayed this world
And it simmers within
Rupturing my innards
Swelling a reddish black
Until the sun burnt skin ruptures
There is a light in the depths of the seething darkness
Confirming each other's voices in the distance
As if to stroke with wet fingertips
I'd like to touch you one day
There is a light in the depths of the darkness
Confirming each other's voices in the distance
As if to stroke with wet fingertips
I'd like to touch you one day
18 The story of the cape of no mercy
Are you sure we can trust that map, Boss?
There it is.
I didn't need for anything as long as I had you two.
You feared nothing.
You were tied to nothing.
Strong and beautiful.
Compared to you, how petty humans are.
Mama...
Jiromaru!
You two are flawless in every way.
Humans are nothing but food before your greatness!
Teach them a lesson!
Bro...
Dororo.
Jiromaru!
Bro... How...?
That shark...
A demon.
That broken excuse for a human is no match for you.
Rip those ugly humans apart!
Bro!
Jiromaru!
Bro!
Bro...
Hey, bro... Stop it, what the heck?
I came for you.
Well, you took long enough.
I had to go through a ton of stuff by myself!
Bro...
He had your leg, huh.
What a load of crap.
You went through all this... You killed Jiromaru...
just to get a human body.
For what, huh?
Is it that important to you?
Bro, we can't just stand around. Itachi is up there.
This is the place. No doubt about that. But this...?
Boss, we can get in through here.
We're gonna be rich now.
Gonna have us the time of our lives.
Hey, stop...
-What's that? -There's something down there.
-Probably the treasure. -Yeah.
So that's the deal, huh.
I knew you weren't some good-for-nothing, Hibukuro.
B-Boss...
If you ain't got guts, go on home.
Get the treasure or die trying. It's one or the other, got it?
What's that?
Bro, is that...?
We found a boat, probably the one Hyakkimaru used.
There are signs of others sneaking onto this cape too.
I believe it's a band of brigands.
No matter.
Kill every human being who is a threat to the peace of our people.
March!
They're Daigo's samurai.
Why the heck are they here?
They're not here to take my treasure, are they?
Hey, the treasure isn't just yours.
Arrows!
Orders are to not leave a single rat alive. Release!
What the heck is going on?
The loot was almost in my grasp...
They're all over the beach. We need to find a place to hide.
There they are!
Jiromaru...
Saburomaru...
We'll be together, forever.
Just give me a few minutes.
And I'll head over with a load of gifts for you.
-Not over there. -Must be this way.
-Itachi. -Hey, Dororo.
You've got a lot of luck in that tiny frame.
Don't worry. Your papa's treasure is still up in that mountain.
There were traps everywhere. One wrong step, and boom, you're done.
I could've disarmed them if I had the time.
This isn't the time for that! Forget the loot, we have to run.
What if the samurai find it first?
I can't have them using my money for some stupid wars.
Boom.
Us, too. Boom.
What are you talking about?
Actually Dororo, it might just work.
They must be hidden around here. Scour the area.
H-Help me...
They have explosives...
Call the other troop back, now!
We gotta get to the beach before they realize it's a decoy.
The demon harming our land of Daigo. Hyakkimaru!
Bro...
Tahomaru...!
All that side with the demon will die here!
Why?
Bro!
Now's our chance, let's run!
But bro...
We'll all die if we stay, we gotta run!
Bro!
Hyogo!
He's not like before. Why?
Young Master is heir to the land of Daigo.
Its people, its prosperity.
He bears it all on his shoulders.
His resolve far exceeds yours.
Why kill me?
Your existence alone
causes calamities to befall our land.
You are the enemy of the people of Daigo!
Release!
Dammit, we gotta hide somewhere.
Hey, this place was on your map.
This might be another trap, but...
the fifth stone from the left is a clue.
Itachi, give it up already.
We could go and live in a better place. All we need is this treasure.
Itachi!
This is the end!
I will shoot you down. You and all that side with you!
What am I supposed to do now, bro?
Young Master, finish him!
Enemies...
You are my enemies.
I won't let you.
I will break that left arm of yours, too, Hyakkimaru.
Itachi, hang in there.
Dororo, one last favor.
Let me see the treasure, just one glimpse...
I beg you...
You're all going to where Jiromaru and Saburomaru went.
No, Dororo!
-Young Master! -Mutsu, Hyogo, retreat!
Dororo.
Hyogo...
Hyogo... Hyogo!
Itachi, Itachi!
Money...
There it is... It's really there...
My money...
When you meet Papa up there, don't quarrel with him this time.
What you have on your back can move people and change the world.
It's a source of great power.
I don't know how I should use this stuff, so I don't want it yet.
Papa, Mama. Wait a bit more'till I figure it out.
Hold on a sec.
This is different, okay?
Just a little something to keep us going.
Hey, hold up!
Born into this world
There is no salvation
The distorted shape of the heart
Yet it beats courageously
There is no turning back
Even from the path of evil
Witnessing the withering seasons
We search for the truth
In our ugliness
We don't even recognize the pain
As we peel back the skin
We are forever tormented by our stupidity
But if the dawn never comes
Through the painful night
You who distrusts nothing
You will be able to love this accursed world
Now that we carry the world on our shoulders
It's time to take it back
Jiromaru
