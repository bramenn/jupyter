but there is only desolation under an autumn sunset.
Swift waters parted by the jagged rocks
The Fukui Class A champion is
Murao Shinichi-kun from the Fukui Nagumo Society.
The runner-up is Wataya Arata-kun from the Fukui Nagumo Society.
The Nagumo Society is impressive.
They placed first and second in the Fukui tournament,
which features over 100 Class A players.
The final match was excellent.
Players from the same society showing no mercy.
Murao-kun managed to outlast his opponent.
Runner-up Wataya Arata
Congratulations.
You're strong, when you're serious about playing.
I can't wait to see you play in the Master match this fall.

Wataya-kun, Wataya-kun.
Oh, Mr. Yoshioka.
Congratulations on second place.
You came so close,
but at least you have everyone's attention now.
Both you and Murao-kun are considered possible favorites
for the Master match this fall.
You've begun to prepare for the tournament this fall
No, Mr. Yoshioka.
My current goal is the high school championship.
There's someone I really want to play.
It's that time of year again.
June.

Verse 3
Feel Love Deepen
Mashima-kun!
I've missed you so much!
It's been a while, Oe-san's mother...
Ri-Rieko-san...
Yep, it's Rieko!
You're looking even more handsome!
Who is that woman?
She's all over him!
Hanano-san!
Why are you just standing there?
I'll help you get dressed, so move to the other room.
Huh? But I'm not playing.
What do you mean?
You're a member of the Mizusawa Karuta Club.
All of our members wear hakama!
I've never worn a hakama before.
It's beautiful...
I'm so happy!
At first, I didn't think this was going to work,
When you raise your arm,
you should hold your sleeve up, so it doesn't roll back.
but now it feels like we finally have our second female member!
Counts as a male member
Group A Preliminaries
Mizusawa Shuryukan West High Togu
This year, there are a total of fourteen schools,
split into four groups.
We're in Group A, with Shuryukan and West High.
Perfect! I can use the data from last year.
Say, Ayase, about the order we're going to use...
Wh-What?!
Huh?! Fission?! Cloning?!
Oh, sorry if my brothers are bothering you.
Hey, it's Big Bro!
In our family, we're taught to run into pretty people.
Tr-Triplets?!
Seriously?
No, they're each a year apart.
We're here to cheer for Big Bro!
You look cool!
You're rockin' that kimono!
Do that one thing!
That one thing?
That's so cute!
You look just like Peko-chan!
Oh, he does!
He doesn't!
Are you going to play in the tournament?
Of course he is.
We were Second Verse Karuta champions.
Big Bro was an ace attacker!
You're also good at mainland karuta, right?
Y-You bet.
Your brother will dominate with the power built
from practicing with wooden cards!
My Hero
How can he say that?
He hasn't beaten any of the second-years in a single practice match,
so he won't get to play.
What?! Tokyo gets to send two schools to the national championship this year?!
If there are more than ten schools in a region,
two get to advance...
We're so lucky!
That makes it a lot easier!
Doesn't matter if one advances
or two advance!
Hokuo Academy will win in the end!
I've been thinking that our Tsukuba and Retro-kun are similar,
but Retro-kun is way weirder.
I can hear you!
You should apologize to Tsukuba-kun.
I can hear you guys!
Porky.
You're too nice.
Why let Eyebrows, who's stuck in Class B even though
he tops you all in skill, be your president?
He's probably kept this a secret from you guys,
but he entered tournaments in Hiroshima and Kyoto,
and he's still Class B because he couldn't win.
You're in the same boat!
I ran into you in Hiroshima, Kyoto, everywhere I went!
Neither of us have made it to Class A!
Well, team matches are a different animal.
We'll be winning.
That's bull!
Honestly, Hokuo doesn't scare us now that Sudo-san's graduated!
You won't be able to say that after seeing our ultimate weapon.
Ultimate weapon?
See you in the finals!
Last year's champions will now return the trophy.
This was the first trophy we worked together to win.
We fought so hard.
We were completely focused on our goal.
A year has passed.
We have to win again
and make it to Nationals.
Our next dream is to be number one in Japan!
Group A Round 1 Mizusawa High School
Nishida Yusei Oe Kana Ayase Chihaya Komachi Tsutomu Mashima Taichi
Yeah, we want to get off to a running start.
Let's use the order Komano came up with.
Sounds good.
I think it's fine.
Oh, then I'll go turn this in.
Huh? Oh, thanks.
Tsukuba-kun?
Komano Tsutomu Tsukuba Akihiro
What do you think you're doing?!
How could you change the order?!
If you've got a problem, say something!
B-But!
I came within three cards of beating Komano-senpai once!
I've almost caught up in terms of skill!
I'm...
Cool down.
If you can't, go home.
Is he playing soon? Is he playing soon?
Keep it down or they'll yell at you.
Let's switch up the order.
For our first match against Shuryukan,
let's switch me out
for Hanano Sumire.
Huh?
Huh?
For our second match against West High,
we'll switch out Kana-chan
for Tsukuba Akihiro.
I just checked and Shuryukan is pretty much
fielding the same lineup as last year.
Going off my data from last year, they're strong against boys
and really weak against girls.
So it makes sense to go with three girls.
I think you're right.
The West High team is still mainly female.
I'm guessing that they still favor a focused style
with vocal encouragement.
Tsukuba-kun.
Open your eyes for a moment.
L-Like this?
You don't need to lick your lips!
If you keep that look on your face the whole match, you'll definitely win!
Your loud voice can also be used as a weapon!
The remaining three players will have to play every game.
Mashima, Porky, Ayase...
It's on you.
Let's go, Mizusawa High School.
for there is no one else out here
Rain takes longer...
The night breaks to day...
May I live to see...
In the sleepy...
She's so cool!
She's so cool!
Uh...
Why are you giving me a chance?
Shh. You're too loud.
I said a lot of rude things.
Can I go home now?
I'm only here because you need five people
to make it to the national tournament!
Anyone could take my spot!
Sorry, everyone!
I've been in your shoes.
I was also given a chance.
There's no rush. You'll get better very soon.
It's okay.
You have the passion and talent.
It's okay.
He's so cool...
Why am I playing in a match?
Nobody told me this would happen!
I just wanted to watch!
Nothing can be worse than living a moment longer
Which card is it? Which card is it?
Um... Um...
Oh, found it!
I'm glad you got a card
So the flower has wilted...
I know this one!
Hehe
Our hands touched
Our hands touched!
That's Ayase-senpai's opponent...
She won by 25 cards. A perfect score.
Thank you very much.
Damn!
She never let her opponent touch her hand.
She wasn't belittled for being a girl.
Memorize! Memorize!
I know all of the first verses!
Focus. Focus...
so I can react!
Faster!
I can feel the blood flowing through the brain cells I've neglected to use!
I'll move faster next time!
You'll start moving faster and faster to take cards, Sumire-chan.
I hate to admit it, but she's right!
Thank you very much.
But I still lost
Yes! One victory down!
Oh, Ms. Miyauchi.
Doesn't the tennis team have a match today?
Our tennis team will be just as good this year.
It didn't take them long to win,
so I'll be heading over to the karuta regional.
Ah, I see.
Oh, that's right.
New members.
Did the karuta club recruit five new members?
Of course!
Look at the 20 applications I have here!
Oh, that's wonderful!
You always deliver, Ms. Miyauchi.
Though 18 of them quit.
Speaking of the karuta club...
Ayase-san turned in a blank career plan again this year.
What are we going to do about her?
Some time...
Please give her some time.
She may act like she never thinks, but she does...
I think.
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
Victory for West High!
Yes!
Mi! Zu! Sa! Wa!
Pight!
Pight?
Honestly, Tsukuba just had to blow it.
He must be very nervous.
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
It's okay. It's okay.
My brothers are watching me.
I have to be the hero!
As friends and strangers come...
First card on the board!
Nice one, Nawano-senpai!
Let's keep it going!
Yes!
So the flower petals...
I hear the beating...
Since I could not hide...
I screwed up!
people would always ask if I was pining for someone
Since I...
when I cannot bear growing any weaker than I already have.
Nothing...
I made the worst possible mistake!
When I get flustered, I forget I'm not playing Second Verse Karuta!
He went for the card that started the same way.
He's a total amateur.
Lucky me.
Tsukuba is up against West High's captain.
She's the only Class A player on their team.
I guess we're fortunate that
we're not wasting one of our Class A players on her,
but this is tough for Tsukuba.
I embarrassed myself to play in this match...
I was so confident...
Karuta was the one thing I was confident about.
You're so lucky, Tsukuba-kun.
You get to play a Class A player in an official match.
You're lucky!
Huh?
That's true.
You rarely get to play people outside your class in tournaments.
This is a chance that only comes in team tournaments.
That's our captain! Way to give him a boost!
What? He's lucky?
That's not it...
Lucky him
I wanted to play her
She's just jealous!
How am I lucky?!
I want to win!
I want to play someone I can beat!
I can't afford to lose my confidence!
I can't afford to...
Since the dew...
It's not working!
Damn...
I was so close...
I was so close?
She's a Class A player?
Impassionate gods...
Ayase-senpai is way faster.
Nishida-senpai is way stronger.
Kitano Town Children's Center
Big Bro is here!
It's Big Akihiro!
Big Bro! Help us with karuta!
Were they bullying you again?
Your brother's here to save the day.
It's okay.
It's okay!
This will be a cinch.
Wh-What?!
If you keep that look on your face the whole match, you'll definitely win!
Your loud voice can also be used as a weapon!
T-Time to take some cards!
It's on now!
I'll make you good!
There are two cards you absolutely have to master.
Feel love deepen and Feel sorrow wash?
You need to make these cards your own.
Since your name is Tsukuba-kun.
But my name's Akihiro,
so I was really good at the eight cards with
second verses that started like my name.
You always have something to complain about!
There are sixteen cards with first verses that start like your name.
Few people can say that they specialize in the The cards.
You're really lucky.
Start with the two Feel cards.
Then you have the sixteen The cards.
It'll take time, but you can master those cards.
Feel love deepen...
Start with the Feel cards!
widening into a river as it descends Mount Tsukuba.
The emotions experienced after a long-awaited reunion banish any lingering memories of the past
Then I move onto the The cards!
The emotions experienced...
Ah, that won't work!
There are too many The cards all over the place!
My brothers are watching me.
But...
My teammates are with me!
She's so good!
Another 25-card perfect game!
Her opponent is clearly weaker,
but Chihaya-chan has been flawless!
This is impressive.
Mashima, Porky, Ayase...
It's on you.
One win for Mizusawa!
Yeah!
Y-Yeah!
We wouldn't be this strong, if the first-years weren't here.
Two wins for Mizusawa!
Not President Mashima...
Okay! Three wins for Mizusawa!
Not Porky...
They're so dependable that it makes me sick!
Sorry...
I can't be the hero.
I'm acting like a loser,
but right now, I just want one card!
One card!
One card!
Tsukuba X - O Nawano (13 card differential)
Thank you very much.
Komano X - O Suda (2 card differential)
Thank you very much.
You were so close, Desktomu-kun!
I almost caught up.
You did a good job against a Class B opponent.
You were so cool, lady!
You're pretty and strong!
Really strong!
Awesome! Awesome!
Th-Thank you...
But Big Bro will catch up in no time!
We only played with wooden cards at home,
but we'll start practicing with the paper cards you use!
Big Bro will get better then!
Big Bro's super awesome!
Then you should all come to the Shiranami Society next week!
Shiranami Society?
Hey! That's no fair!
I got us some new members, Dr. Harada!
It's been a long time.
Yes, that's right.
I'm looking forward to it, Mr. Ise.
I'll get you registered.
I can't wait to watch the tournament this year.
You'll probably dominate the individual bracket though.
I still have much to improve.
If you need a practice partner, drop by the Myojo Society.
Thank you very much.
Oh, there's one more thing to look forward to.
The grandson of Eternal Master Wataya is coming from Fukui
to participate in the individual bracket.
Everybody's been talking about it.
How many years has it been since he's played in an official match?
Even I can't wait.
Arata?
