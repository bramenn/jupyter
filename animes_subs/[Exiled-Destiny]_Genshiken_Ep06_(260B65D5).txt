Nothing holds his attention like an intense game.
Hey, Kohsaka.
Hmm?
Would you rather have been with a girl who plays games with you?
That's not really important.
You don't choose a girl based on that...
Well, maybe that's just what dating him is like...
But to be honest I feel miserable right now...
He doesn't look at me at all, either...
Oh, sorry, TV time.
Uh, you mean anime?
Yeah, it's about to start.
I've been looking forward to it all day.
I'm sorry I'm gutless, but this is my limit.
Tokino!
Outside, outside, outside, outside.
Just hold out a little longer!
The heat must be getting to our opponents too.
Let's talk about something...
Genshiken
I woke up and as usual forgot my cell and missed the Express.
My life reflected in the train window.
I'm sure I have something that I won't lose to anyone in Japan...
I can't run fast, though.
I'm not that strongly-built.
Here I go, at my dauntless pace.
Pass away, today's sadness, raining in the sun!
Hesitation, repetition, dreaming all night, all night.
Farewell sadness, to outer space you go!
Look to the sky and shout at the top of your lungs!
At this tempo!
Right now, at this tempo!
Genshiken Right now, at this tempo!
Genshiken
That again!
That's pretty good, chaining a low light kick into a standing super.
I can only pull it off about one in five tries though.
These two sure are a trip to watch.
Ohno.
Isn't your hair too long?
Huh?
I mean, it makes you look kinda scary.
Huh?
If you cut it, or even just added some color, it'd lighten up.
Is it like this for cosplay?
Hmm, that's part of it...
People told me they envied how black and straight it was.
I guess they had a point, but this is Japan.
That's true...
So it's for cosplay?
I guess so.
The salon I go to gives discounts for referrals.
I'm not used to places like that, though...
Yeah, bring it on!
Ohno.
Aren't your tits too big?
Huh?
What's your cup size again?
Don't you already know?
Yeah but I forgot.
What?
Oh my god, it takes cups that big to support those manga-sized tits?
Saki!
It's just like that soccer...
W-World Cup?
I'm going to claim sexual harassment.
That's the scary you.
Hey, are you ignoring me?
W-What?
Don't what me.
I'm trying to get you to discuss something with me.
Discuss?
Well you see, this is about one of my high school friends.
She says she's been dating an otaku lately.
Oh yeah?
Well, at a glance he seems different from Kohsaka.
So anyway, when they have sex at night they leave the TV on.
The guy says it's to mask the noise since the walls are thin.
But then last night...
Some anime came on during it...
And just before that, they had switched to doggy style.
I wonder if he was back where she couldn't see him watching it...
What do you think, Ohno?
Um, well...
Lasting more than 30 minutes is amazing!
Laughing about it only digs your own grave.
What about you guys?
Yesterday, you said? What time?
12:30, she said.
Oh, that!
You saw it, didn't you?
Yes, that.
Kujibiki Unbalance
It's quite a highly rated anime right now.
I watched it too.
So did I.
You don't say...
Then maybe it'd be best if she cosplayed after all!
I mean, she got a reaction from cat ears a while back.
A-All right, why don't I lend her a costume?
I'm sure the size difference would just make her feel bad.
Besides, I don't think you want it being used for that.
I see your point.
Um...
You were talking about a friend?
Of course I was.
But what about you two?
If you had a girlfriend, would you want to have sex in costume?
Uh, well...
I don't even think about that kind of thing, not having a girlfriend.
Ah, but I have seen cosplay scenes in adult videos...
They're not very interesting, though.
The women are just porn actresses, after all.
There are also cosplay dojinshi, erotic ones.
Yeah, I saw some in a catalog at Comic Fest.
I wonder if they're on CD-ROM.
Look at me when you're talking.
So anyway, you're going to have to ask Tanaka about stuff like that.
Hmm...
Then I suppose...
if she liked to cosplay...
Like Ohno?
Saki...
Well, you know...
But you wouldn't be able to do that...
Not me, it's a friend of mine.
Hey, either way.
The more fundamental question is...
That's impossible.
But that's what we're thinking about almost all the time.
Anime, games, not much else.
Even Kohsaka shouldn't be any exception to the rule.
You think so?
Otherwise he wouldn't be such a good gamer.
Not to mention, he knows a lot of system-related info.
Hmm, video games...
I guess games really are his thing.
I couldn't possibly become an otaku...
Heh, you will?
It's better than trying to get his attention with shabby cosplay.
She might find she's an otaku before she knows it.
Shut up.
After careful consideration, the game of choice is Puyo Pop Fever.
You connect and pop falling puyos in this latest of the hit puzzle game series.
That's why you rotate it here like this.
Rotate?
You insert it here, these pop, and these shift down.
Why?
She did it.
Finally.
What?
What? What?
Oh yeah!
Thuddy thud. Oh yeah!
No way!
What the hell's with that?
It's no use asking us.
Okay, I'll give it a shot tonight.
Now that was weird.
Kasukabe played a video game.
Stop the world so I can get off.
But, thank goodness she got to where she can do it.
Playing against Kohsaka, though...
You're right.
He'll have a 5-chain put together in no time.
Hopefully he'll hold back against her a little...
Know what, though, she was talking about herself before...
So tonight...
I don't like this vibe...
Let's play Puyo Pop!
Huh?
Play me in Puyo Pop.
What's with you?
I played it today at Genshiken, it was kind of fun.
Wow...
Here we go!
Whadda ya think?
Huh?
Oh?
Yeah!
Here I go!
Ice Storm!
Take that!
You're done for!
You're done for!
Ha ha, you suck!
What?
What?
Oh yeah!
Thuddy thud. Oh yeah!
All right!
Puyo Pop cosplay.
Does it turn you on?
Well, I mean, you're a puyo.
That night was the last time Saki Kasukabe ever played a video game...
Hello.
Where's Kohsaka?
In Akihabara...
What, aren't you playing league matches today?
Looks like it's best not to pour any more fuel on the fire.
Dammit, if Kohsaka were here, she could just leave with him.
Oh yeah, that's right.
It's almost been a year since you joined, Sasahara.
Y-Yeah.
So? Have you grown at all?
Grown?
What do you mean by growth in this case?
Well, I spend a lot more money now.
But I get the feeling that's just me being out of control...
I can't call myself an otaku when I don't have my own computer.
Whoa, you say you're not otaku?
No, it's not that.
Maybe I just have a ways to go...
Why don't you buy a computer?
Have you got some mental block against it?
Not at all.
Like I said before, I spent all my money.
No, you can buy one!
If you put your mind to it, you'll find a way.
It's like that proverb...
Think after you buy!
Th-This would be the part where s-someone smacks you down.
But, that's exactly why I don't have any money right now.
True.
Oh, that's me.
I don't know this number...
Then don't answer it.
I couldn't do that.
Hello...
Oh hell, it's you!
What's with this big time un-Sasahara-like attitude?
You switched cell phones again?
Yeah, yeah...
Wait a minute!
No, I'm on my way!
Don't move.
No, not that...
Yeah...
May I ask who?
My little sister's at the train station...
Wow, you've got a sister!
Trippy.
First a childhood friend, now a sister!
I feel s-so moved.
No, you've got the wrong idea!
She's a fashion slave, a trashy high school chick.
She wouldn't understand us, in fact it's best if you don't meet her.
On that note, you don't go for the little sister look at all.
In fighting games you always use the sexy older female characters.
You're right.
I can say for a fact that fad's just an illusion for those...
You're such a fool, Sasahara.
Why would I ever need a little sister I'm related to?
he's not pulling any punches.
B-But, in a way it's normal.
You'll think she's from another planet if you see her.
Well, that's how it goes.
Please don't follow me!
We won't.
The station, you said?
So that's her...
Yup, she's got nothing in common with us...
You can't even see her face through the make-up.
T-They all look the same.
What do you think she calls him?
Big Brother is right out.
With her, probably bro.
Or else h-hey you...
What's with you guys?
Took you long enough, monkey!
Monkey...
Pity...
You're still saying that?
Whatever, lend me some money.
You mean you came all this way for that?
My boyfriend and I went to the park zoo in his car...
My purse's in his car.
Weren't you the one who said...
I know, but it's no use.
I can't stand homely guys.
My friends are all the same way too.
Besides, this is normal.
Now I go home on my own and we make up big time.
It's the big in thing right now, this whole test thing.
I don't get it.
So give me some money.
That wouldn't make it on your own...
I'll bet she's the type who's easily influenced by friends.
Is she?
And it only takes an instant.
I can't see her growing up in the same household as Sasahara.
What was Sasahara's first name again?
I think it's Kanji...
Y-You can't be...
Hey Kanji!
What're you up to?
I thought you were gonna hang out with me.
What?
Oh, who's she?
Huh? Eh?
Kasukabe, look...
I asked you not to follow me because you do things like this.
Way to kill the mood!
You really are a boring guy.
My friend's girlfriend...
You see how she is...
An otaku?
Don't hit her for that just because she's my sister...
You two look identical in the face.
What the? Is she, like, always this rude?
Something tells me this is going to end ugly...
Come on, that's enough, Kasukabe.
You too, Keiko.
What are you guys up to?
They said he went to Akihabara...
That means he went and bought more pain in the ass otaku crap.
Hello!
My sister.
Hello.
Let's get going, Kohsaka.
This is her real boyfriend.
Huh?
Oh, right!
These are the ones we had on order.
Here's yours.
Thanks...
What a coincidence, they delivered it right before my eyes.
What's that? Looks big, must be cool.
Well, y'know...
It's about as tall as I am.
Want to see it? They're both the same.
No, don't sweat it. Not here, Kohsaka!
That'd do it...
Y-You called it...
Here it comes...
Kohsaka, let's go.
Sasahara's sister needs to talk to him.
Oh, okay.
Unrolling this huge thing would get in the way, anyway.
There's no one around, though.
She needs to hurry home, too.
There's a test that needs passing, right?
Huh?
That's right.
Here's some money, now scram.
I'm in no real hurry.
Right now I want to see this.
Okay, just for a bit.
Ah, not here...
Please wait a moment.
W-What a cute picture.
So looks win out, huh Keiko?
That's really nice.
Isn't it?
She's from a game I really like.
K-Kill me now...
There's no escape now...
She's so not ready for us.
9000 for the tapestry, then 5000 loaned to my sister...
See ya.
Sure.
Is there any chance Kohsaka would quit being an otaku?
Not at all, he's way more otaku than I am.
He sure doesn't look it!
Kasukabe over there is also trying to make him quit...
Give it a rest and stop dwelling on looks.
Just leave it to Kohsaka to spice up the situation.
That poor little sister.
What do you mean?
That was 9000 yen, though?
If that's how you spend money, you'll never afford a computer.
Yeah, although...
To not buy what one likes is to deny oneself.
Sasahara...
While that's true, we're all aware that you don't own that adult game!
You probably play it at Kohsaka's!
Just buy a computer already!
Don't eat for three months!
That's ridiculous...
W-Why not try cutting back on games and DVDs for now?
PCs are cheap these days.
Hey, Kohsaka.
Hmm?
Will you watch anime again today?
Uh-uh.
Not today.
We took no detours or shortcuts...
Only vivid dreams extended deep into the shadows.
We aren't quite grown up.
Simple but complicated glistening like marbles.
The time we could see from there sparkled, even if nothing big happened.
What we see from the marbles in our hands now is a little different...
Suioh University
Hey, do you know much about SM?
Huh?
What?
Heartache's been feeling good to me recently...
I wonder if that's a kind of SM...
Hey Ohno, is cosplay fun?
Will you do it?
No, I won't!
I can understand if foreigners do it.
So much is based on western culture and clothing...
But it just doesn't work for Japanese.
Um...
And then these cosplay names, why are they in kanji!?
And it's names like Reika and Sakuya with high stroke counts!
Then their surnames sound like some court noble. I mean, Ayanokouji?
I mean, it's like get a grip and know thyself.
Saki, you just made enemies of a million cosplayers nationwide.
Huh? Why?
