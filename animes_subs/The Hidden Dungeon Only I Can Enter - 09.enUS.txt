Wind Selection?
Yeah. I got it in a dungeon,
but you have more of a knack for the wind attribute.
Well... thanks.

hhhhhhhhhhhhnew! new!
You gained two new skills!
You're right.
I can feel power flowing through me.
Run Like the Wind!
Wind Slash!
That was great. Looks like you'll get the hang of them in no time.
Yeah. Thanks so much, Noir!
What's the matter? You seem a bit down.
N-No, it's not that.
Anyway, would you like to go to a party with me this weekend?
Isn't that just for nobles?
Yeah, I have to dance...
and I want to dance with you.
Do you not want to?
I wouldn't say that...
So you're fine with me dancing with other boys...
W-Wait!
I'll go! I'll go to this party.
That's good.
But you know...
You probably wouldn't notice if someone took me from you.
Huh?
If someone kidnapped me and did questionable things to me...
You'd probably think I was dirty and hate me.
Emma...
Noir... You doofus.
I'm home.
Wh-What the heck is going on?
We can't seem to find an open shop to use as our rare items shop.
They keep saying they won't rent or sell any space
to people who aren't proper nobles!
Are they saying I'm not a proper noble?!
In the plan to open a rare items shop...
My father's in charge of finding a location.
My job is to bring back items we can sell from the dungeon...
But the Stardia family is a baronet family, so we're always ridiculed.
Baronet
Viscount
Baron
Earl
Marquess
Duke
That's also why I was hesitant to go to the party with Emma.
We don't need to be in any hurry, Father.
I had no faith in you to begin with.
Do you really have to say that?!
A-Anyway...
Father, do you have any clothes suitable for a party?
A party? Why?
Emma's going to attend one, and I'm going with her.
I see. In that case...
Ta-da! The best suit I have!
The size seems fine...
But it seems dirty and has a funny smell.
Well, I spilled some alcohol on it and just left it like that for years.
I'll just buy a new one.
The Day of the Party
I look forward to tonight.
Good evening.
It's been so long, Noir.
Lord Ladan and Lady Romy, I'm glad to see you're both well!
Look how much you've grown.
I remember the little boy wetting his pants like it was just yesterday.
P-Please forget about that.
Anyway, where's Emma?
She's getting dressed. Girls have a lot to do.
R-Right...
By the way... Did Emma tell you about today?
Huh? You mean dancing with her?
Ah, so she hasn't told you...
Sorry to keep you waiting, Noir.
Do I look weird?
Y-You don't look weird at all!
I'm glad.
There is something that I must tell you.
A few days ago, I received a proclamation.
The sender was none other than... the Phantom Thief Phantom.
The Phantom Thief? Here?
Not you, too, Earl Bourne.
Phantom's the one everyone's been talking about lately.
But have no fear.
It appears the thief wishes to steal my Mermaid's Tear, but that will not happen.
Adventurers from this kingdom's greatest guild, Lahmu, are guarding it!
So they're from Lahmu...
Is that pretty lady a martial artist?
Leila Overlock Lv. 148

Wh-Whoa, she's strong!
She's my age, and her level's that high?
The Mermaid's Tear has already been secured.
Phantom will never find the jewel!
Then we're safe.
Thank goodness.
Now, everyone,
enjoy tonight's gala in peace, with no fear of this petty thief!
Emma?
Did Phantom threaten you?
N-No. I don't know anything about them. There's nothing to worry about.
Come on. It's almost time to dance.
Sure...
The dancers perform in order of their ranks.
Apparently, Emma and I are going last.
Oh, Miss Emma!
It's me! Mike from the House of Kentall.
You've become even more beautiful!
You're as dashing as ever, Lord Mike. You have a way with words, as usual.
Emma is used to dealing with nobles.
To be honest, she seems a bit distant.
Miss Emma... would you reconsider my request to court you?
My answer won't change.
Does someone already have your heart?
Who are you?
I've been friends with Emma since we were little.
My name is Noir Stardia. I belong to a baronet family.
Ah, a baronet...
Why don't we have a little competition?
Let's see who can lead Miss Emma better in this dance.
We'll be wagering a date with her.
Hey, I didn't agree to this!
I accept.
Huh?!
Then it's settled.
The applause from the crowd will tell us who the winner is.
I will be going first.
N-Noir...
It's okay. Don't worry.
It's not like me to just accept a challenge like that.
But I couldn't bear to watch
Emma enjoying a conversation with someone else.
You're up next, Noir.
R-Right...
I have high hopes for you...
Lord Baronet.
Mike's dance was top-notch... but I have to win.

Get Creative hhhhh
O-Okay...
Hi-yah!
You're too tense, Noir.
W-Well, yeah, but...
We actually get to dance with each other. Let's enjoy it.
Emma is right in front of you, Lord Noir.
Right.
They look lovely.
Noir...
When did he become such a good dancer?
Damn it.
That was so much fun!
Yeah.
We really are the best pair!
Emma...
What's going on?
Ladies and gentlemen!
The one you've all been waiting for, Phantom Thief Phantom, is here!
As I proclaimed, I've come for the Mermaid's Tear
and the baron's daughter, Emma Brightness!
Sh-She's here to take Emma?
You probably wouldn't notice if someone took me from you.
She must've received a notice, too... But I didn't even realize...
Curse you, Phantom!
We're counting on you, adventurers from Lahmu!
Leader Leila!
Leave it to me!
Sh-She's fast!
E-Emma, take my hand!
You should be more careful.
Emma!
N-Noir!
I'll be taking her. Thanks!
Emma!
Where's the thief?!
Where's Phantom?!
Th-The Mermaid's Tear!
I-It's safe...
Wh-Who are you?!
You let your guard down, Earl.
Now we've taken both things we said we'd take.
Have a wonderful evening, everyone!
There were two of them?
I'll go after the guy! Leila, go after the woman!
Roger!
I'm sorry!
I-I'm coming, too!
Who are you?
I'm Noir Stardia. I'm an adventurer belonging to Odin!
Sorry, but you need to stay out of this.
Not because you belong to a rival guild,
but this is just too dangerous for an ordinary adventurer.
Let us handle this
No!
I won't...
I won't let anyone take Emma!
All right.
I'm Leila. Make sure you don't slow me down.
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter.
Hmph. You're awfully persistent.

Be careful of her Summoning skill!
Are you using Discerning Eye? That's quite the skill.
Well, I guess I don't need to hide that skill anymore.
Firebird Lv. 50
Skill
This is your only chance to back off.
Emma is my precious friend! I'd rather die than abandon her!
Well, aren't you a feisty one?
O-Oh, no!
This is the Demon Fist?! Whoa...
What's the matter?
You won't be able to save your precious friend like that.
That firebird is in the way!
If I can just delete Summoning...
LP needed to delete: 6000 Available LP: 5200
I can't! I don't have enough LP!
Every time we get closer, she escapes above!
I wonder who's gonna die first.
I-I'll just have to...
H-He has a lightning spell?
I was able to see that you're weak against lightning with my Discerning Eye.
Yeah? So... what?
You can't hit me if I'm out of range!
The range for Lightning Strike is just three meters...
Looks like she's having a hard time, too. She's getting steamed quite nicely.
Leila physically strikes her opponents.
Going up against that bird is the worst for her.
But now that the woman's away...

Wha... What do you think you're doing?!
Leila, now!
Got it!
I'll use Water Drop to back you up!
Not happening!
Why... is there lightning...
I used my Magical Fusion skill to combine Water Drop and Lightning Strike.
Thanks for falling for that.
I'll take care of the rest!
Wh-What's with you two?
Emma!
Emma!
Noir...
Sh-She's still not waking up...
That's probably due to magic.
You're an amazing martial artist.
My parents are both adventurers. They've trained me ever since I was little.
I actually came here to study abroad with my younger brother and joined Lahmu.
So...
Since I'm in Odin, that makes you my rival.
Yeah, but...
That doesn't mean we can't be friends, does it?
You're right. Let's be friends.
You guys!
Leader! Where's the guy?
I caught him and handed him over to the earl.
That's why I came to back you up.
Thanks, but there's no need.
We caught her, too.
That expression...
And did he always have that earring?
Well done, Leila! And...
He's Noir Stardia.
Just in case, I'll use Discerning Eye.
Skills
What?
Wh-What are you...
Now, grovel.
M-My body feels heavy...
Is this the Gravity Manipulation skill?
This way, princess.
Wh-What's going on?
H-He's in disguise! He's actually...
Earring of Deception
Well, that's impressive.
Tom Bertholda Lv. 154
Age Occupation Skills Skills
I knew it! He's the other half of Phantom!
N-No...
I'm going to make Miss Emma my wife.
I've always taken whatever I wanted, you see.
Wh-Why are you after Emma?
I saw her around town, and it was love at first sight.
So I followed her and did some research.
And now... she's finally mine!
Stop!
Give it up.
A weakling like you could never be the knight who protects her.
L-Let go of Emma!
You waste your time.
E-Emma is...
Noir...
H-How can you move?
Emma is... is...
someone very dear to me!
Get crushed!
Don't do anything weird to my Noir!
Noir!
E-Emma? Are you okay?
Yeah, I can move just fine.
Sorry. I guess I was kidnapped.
Well, it was super dark...
But... But did they do anything weird to me?
Do you think I'm dirty now?
Emma...
I'm sorry... I can't believe I...
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I promise to repay you for this another day.
Noir... Thank you so much.
You truly are Emma's hero.
It was nothing...
I'm sure if I was kidnapped, Emma would come save me, too.
Of course!
I'd even go to the depths of Hell! Right?
H-Her eyes are a bit scary...
With that, everything was resolved.
For Rent
To thank us, the earl agreed to help us get a location for our rare items shop.
It's on the market for 200,000 rels a month, but they agreed to 20,000 for us.
We can have it that cheap?!
Yes.
They also agreed to let us remodel it,
so let's make it look really nice.
Leave it to me! I have excellent taste!
Mother and I will take care of the interior.
Brother Dearest, please continue to get us more items.
Hey! What about me? Hello?
You can clean, dear.
You got it!
I'll help with the shop, too. Let's do our best!
A-Alice's eyes are scaring me a bit...
Next time, Let's Go to the Hot Springs.
