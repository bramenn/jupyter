Nothing like a cup of tea to start off the day.
Oh. Thanks a lot, Krabby!
Professor. Good morning.
Good morning, Ash. I was just wondering when you might be calling.
You have some good news?
I sure do. Look at this.
Ah! Mm!
Pretty impressive, huh? I've already earned four badges.
Only four badges?
Ash? Are you still there?
I just found out this morning that all your other rivals
have earned five badges each, including Gary.
They've all passed through Celadon City, too.
Oh! That Gary!
You'd better hurry up, Ash.
You don't want to fall further behind the others.
And Gary has already captured 30 Pokemon.
Thirty Pokemon?
What about you? What's going on?
I haven't gotten any Pokemon from you in a while.
Not since the day you sent me Krabby here.
Krabby. How you doing?
We've become very good friends.
We especially enjoy tea time and writing poetry,
and some of it's not that bad either.
Every day it's cake and tea Just my Pokemon and me
-You like it? -I don't know very much about poetry.
Now, listen, Ash, writing poetry is a lot like Pokemon training.
I can't write a good poem without rhymes.
And you can't be a good trainer without catching more Pokemon.
Have to go now. The tea's getting cold.
Primeape Goes Bananas
Mm.
Hmm? You look kind of down, Ash.
Huh?
-Have a donut. That always cheers me up. -Pika, pika.
These donuts are great. Jelly-filled are my favorite.
Nothing beats a jelly-filled donut. Huh?
I just heard Gary has five badges.
I get it. He's upset because falling behind.
Pika-pi.
The next town we come to is Celadon City. Isn't there supposed to be a gym there?
There sure is. All we've got to do is follow this road.
Celadon City is only a day's walk from here,
even less if we keep up a fast pace.
Can Ash catch up with his rivals?
Or will he be left in the dust?
Hmm.
There's no way those guys are going to win.
Just remember, Ash,
unlike all the other wannabe trainers out there,
you've got to make it to the Pokemon League your own way.
Right. Remember, it's quality over quantity,
especially if you've got lots of different Pokemon.
Then they'll help you catch others.
Yeah, that's it. Catch lots of Pokemon.
-He'll never learn. -I didn't ask you.
Pika?
Oh, it's a Pokemon.
Mankey, a pig-monkey Pokemon of the fighting type.
Known for its superior footwork, it packs a powerful punch.
-Maybe it wants a donut. -
Huh?
Pika.
-I think it likes it. -That donut is my own special recipe.
No artificial ingredients.
A fighting Pokemon. That'll really help me in battle.
Hold on. You're not going to start by throwing a Poke Ball at it?
There's no way I'm going to miss this chance.
Mankey, you're mine now!
Huh?
-It's a donut! -A donut Pokemon?
Looks to me like you got it pretty angry.
Now what are we supposed to do?
Although Mankey is usually calm,
it does have a bad temper.
Once Mankey begins to thrash, stopping it is impossible.
What does it mean by thrash?
Huh?
You should have let it finish that donut, Ash.
Didn't your mother ever teach you manners?
She never mentioned Mankeys.
I shouldn't have made them taste so good.
Your homemade donuts are our only hope. Maybe more donuts will stop it.
Well, it's sure worth a try. Poke Ball.
- -Oh, sorry. Donut, go!
-That didn't work! -Ah! I wasted a donut.
- Ah! -Misty!
Mankey!
-Are you okay, Ash? -Of course I'm not okay!
- -Pi. Pi, pi.
I surrender.
-Perfect. -Perfect.
Purr-fect.
Now is the perfect time to capture Pikachu.
While that little twerp is out of the action,
we'll make a sneak surprise attack.
If we pull this off,
the boss will put us on the board of directors.
Team Rocket will rule the world.
You really think so?
-When you dream, you've got to dream big. -You sure are dreaming.
Hmm?
He is easy to satisfy.
That Mankey sure beat you up big time.
-Are you okay? -Pika?
Where'd my hat go?
Ah!
-You little thief. Give me back my hat! -
You can get another hat, Ash.
It's not the hat. It's the principle.
Hold it! You're just going to get beat up again.
It's mine!
-What's so great about that hat? -I can't replace that hat.
I won it at the official Pokemon League expo.
Don't you know how tough it is to get one of those hats?
An official expo hat?
Oh.
Hey, all you Pokemon league fans.
Now you have a chance to win
one of 100 limited edition Pokemon League official hats.
It's wearable, it's washable, and it's official.
Don't miss your chance to win the official hat
of the official expo of the official Pokemon League!
It's official.
I didn't know that was an official Pokemon League hat.
I remember I entered the same contest too.
I had to send in about a million postcards to win that hat.
No wonder I didn't win. I only sent in one.
Poor Ash. Losing an official hat is like losing your best friend.
Pika?
Almost got it.
- Well, hello there, chumps. - Huh?
Team Rocket.
What are you doing here?
Aren't you happy to see us?
Hmm? Huh?
Hmm? Huh.
Buzz off!
I wish he hadn't done that.
Still trying to capture Pikachu?
We just want to borrow it. Permanently.
Your situation is hopeless.
-Hand Pikachu over or else... -Or else what?
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above...
Jessie.
James.
Team Rocket. Blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Meowth! That's right.
I'm having a major hat crisis.
Could you try to steal Pikachu some other time?
Now's the perfect time.
You're obviously too pooped to protect your Pikachu.
If you guys don't get out of here fast, you're going to get as whipped as Ash did.
-By who? -By Mankey.
What's a Mankey?
I guess that thing I kicked out of the way.
Huh?
It... It... It... evolved.
What's that?
Primeape. If you make eye contact
with this evolved form of Mankey, it will chase you forever.
Ha. This fur ball? That's ridiculous.
Now, let's capture Pikachu.
-Go, Ekans. -And go, Koffing.
-Ekans. -Koffing.
Pika.
Come on!
Huh?
-No! -Ah!
How dare you damage my perfection? Now you'll pay!
Ekans. Koffing. Never mind Pikachu.
Get that Primeape!
But we came for Pikachu.
Team Rocket always puts beauty before duty.
-Come on. -Ah!
Koffing. Kof, Koffing.
Now's our chance.
My hat!
Pikachu.
Don't look at it in the eye, Pikachu!
Cha!
Ooh, pik. Chu...
Chu.
-It's got my hat! -And it never sent in one postcard.
Pikachu, thunder shock!
Pikachu!
Nice work!
Pikachu?
Now what'll we do?
That attack made it even madder.
Wait a minute. I have a theory.
Primeape's not trying to steal your hat.
- Huh? -It's scared of us.
When it was a Mankey, you tried to capture it.
Then James kicked it.
I think it took your hat so it could get a little attention.
-Because it's lonely all by itself. -Be careful.
Now, everything's going to be fine.
Give me a smile, buddy.
Hey, quit it! Knock it off! That hurts! Let me go! Stop, stop!
- -Huh?
- I think Brock needs a new theory. - Guess so.
Once a Primeape begins its strongest attack, thrash,
it goes completely out of control.
Uh, I think we're in big trouble.
Run!
-There... -They...
-Go. -Looks like Team Rocket's blasting...
-Off... -Once again!
-If we split up, maybe we can lose it. -Okay.
Oh, no. It doesn't look like Primeape's easy to lose.
I just hope Ash doesn't look Primeape in the eye.
-Now what? -Let's find Ash.
I don't know how much longer I can run.
Nothing like digging a hole when you want to play dirty.
- Koffing. - Hmm.
At last, the moment of truth.
Koff, koff, koff.
Koffing.
What's a hole doing in the road?
Koffing, you nincompoop.
-How'd you get down here? -Pika!
-Pikachu. -Why don't you come for a ride on my head?
What? Pikachu, thunder shock.
Pikachu!
Not me!
Huh? Ah!
I can't write a good poem without rhymes.
And you can't be a good trainer without catching more Pokemon.
Huh? Ash.
Professor Oak's right. No more games.
I'm going to capture you, Primeape.
Why do you have to be so stubborn?
Primeape is too dangerous to capture, Ash.
Just forget the hat.
It's not that. It's because I want to be a Pokemon master.
A real master would never let any Pokemon get away.
Pika.
He's always trying to sound tough.
Squirtle, I choose you.
-Soak its head with your water gun. -Squirtle!
Ah! Huh?
Squirtle, return!
Bulbasaur, I choose you.
Bulbasaur!
Bulbasaur, razor leaf now!
Bulba!
Bulbasaur, return.
Charmander, go.
Char!
Charmander!
Charmander!
Pika, pika.
Charmander.
The flame on its tail? What's happening?
Charmander's special attack, rage.
It gains more power the more it is attacked.
It will continue to fight until its opponent falls.
All right! I didn't know it had that kind of power.
Charmander, go!
Mander!
Char!
Char!
Pika? Pikachu!
Burn now, Charmander. Flamethrower attack!
Char!
Pika.
Hey, Pikachu!
Char!
Good work, Charmander. I'll take over now.
Poke Ball, go.
Yes.
Huh?
All right! Primeape is mine.
-You did it! -Congratulations!
-Chu. -Thanks a lot, Pikachu.
- Don't forget us. - Huh?
So it's the whole gang.
It's your fault we ended up in here. Where's Primeape?
Well, why don't you just see for yourself?
Huh?
Looks Like Team Rocket's blasting off again!
Primeape sure gave them a thrashing.
Well, at least now Primeape's doing the thrashing on our side.
Primeape's good at thrashing,
but it's got a lot to learn about team spirit.
-A hat might help. -Better start sending in postcards.
I'll do whatever it takes to become a Pokemon master.
Charmander, Primeape, return.
-Pikachu! Pika! -What is it?
There's Celadon City.
You know, if Primeape hadn't chased us,
we wouldn't have gotten here as fast as we did.
-Right, Brock? -Yeah, I guess it was lucky after all.
Pika, pika.
Way to go, Primeape.
Now that I caught a new Pokemon, it's time to earn a badge.
And so, by capturing Primeape, Ash has taken another step
on his journey to the Pokemon League.
Of course, it takes more than a new Pokemon
to make a Pokemon Master,
but now our young hero is more determined than ever.
Meow!
I wish we had some donuts.
