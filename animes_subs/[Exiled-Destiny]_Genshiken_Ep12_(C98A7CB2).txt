Genshiken
I woke up and as usual forgot my cell and missed the Express.
My life reflected in the train window.
I'm sure I have something that I won't lose to anyone in Japan...
I can't run fast, though.
I'm not that strongly-built.
Here I go, at my dauntless pace.
Pass away, today's sadness, raining in the sun!
Hesitation, repetition, dreaming all night, all night.
Farewell sadness, to outer space you go!
Look to the sky and shout at the top of your lungs!
At this tempo!
Right now, at this tempo!
Genshiken Right now, at this tempo!
All right, this is more or less the financial report.
Since we saved money on the school festival...
Oh?
Look what I found, a sketchbook.
H-Hey, Kasukabe!
Can I look through it? H-Hey, Kasukabe!
Can I look through it?
Wow.
Pretty Menma
Yow, it's full of models and figures.
No touching, okay?
Look, Saki, these are costumes for you to wear.
Why not try them on, since you're here?
Don't wanna see it, don't wanna hear it. Why not try them on, since you're here?
This is how I live, love it or leave it.
See ya.
12, Problems and Countermeasures Arise When an Organization Undergoes Reconstruction
No more intruders left.
Yeah, I guess we're in gallery mode now.
Why don't we go?
Ohh, sure.
That's unusual...
Wanna get something to eat?
Let's do that.
What to get...
What's the matter?
That's not a safe place to be.
I figured you'd show up about now.
Oh, really...
I don't suppose you have some plan to turn all this around?
Eh...
No, sorry, I don't...
Maybe this time you went a bit too far, starting that fire...
Yeah...
But according to the information I've procured, the club won't be disbanded.
Information?
A limited suspension of activities...
Wouldn't it make you happier to see Genshiken go away?
Uh well yeah, that is true.
It's like, gotten boring lately having to meet at people's places.
Like it's no fun, not how the group should be.
I don't think it's something you should feel so responsible for.
They probably don't blame you as much as they say they do.
That might be true.
But for all that...
Several days later, a formal punishment was issued to Genshiken.
For one month from the day of issue, suspension of club activities...
We were allowed to take things we needed from the club room...
Should we keep this in someone's room?
Good idea, we can use it for New Year's.
Get some controllers and games too.
I wonder what the volunteer program will be like.
Who knows!
But it'll probably be welfare-related or helping out with official events, right?
I guess there's a lot of that over the holidays.
You're probably right.
Right in the middle of year-end sale wars!
Not having time for any of it really stings!
All thanks to someone!
Now, now.
Saki?
Saki? What's the matter?
Hey, Saki?
Me?
Was it me?
Did I do that?
Well duh!
I mean, she's really crying? It's not just an act?
It's for real!
We're sorry.
We didn't realize, did we?
R-Right.
We'll leave the rest to you, Kohsaka!
Everybody out! Hurry!
I-Isn't it a bad idea to leave them by themselves?
What?
T-That's right, we don't know what'll happen in a situation like this!
And y-you're the one with the key, M-Madarame.
Anyway you're the one who made her cry!
H-Hey, wait a minute.
This is your chance!
If you wait you won't be able to go! Do it as our chairman!
You know, lately...
Yeah.
I can't smoke.
Smoke?
Cigarettes...
I mean, fire...
It scares me even in my dreams...
W-Well that's just as well! Cigarettes are bad for you!
Crap, that didn't work.
It's okay, I know you were scared.
Don't worry, just relax.
R-Really, when that happened...
I dropped my cigarette because Madarame scared me.
Of course, it was me, it was my fault.
No, it's my fault! I can see that...
That's why I even cosplayed, but I'm always having to make it up to everyone.
Of course! Sorry!
I won't talk about it anymore.
Damn, is that the only way I can talk right now?
But you know, Saki...
I think cosplaying was the right thing to do.
That became more a way for us to appeal to other clubs...
After that, the others weren't so harsh towards Genshiken.
Uh, yeah, that's very true.
The mood around us changed a bit after that.
The video the manga club shot seems to have quite the cult following.
So even if it takes time, part of why Genshiken can pick up the pieces...
Besides, the reason we pick on you...
That sounded so embarrassing, I just...
I'm going to the bathroom.
Okay.
Yeah, she hasn't been smoking lately.
You're right, and she no longer smells of it.
Well, maybe this is an unexpected side of her.
I wouldn't call it unexpected...
But it's something we easily fail to notice.
Saki.
Hold on, I need to fix my face. Saki.
Hold on, I need to fix my face.
Here's the key.
All right, I'll accept responsibility for it.
This is the volunteer work schedule.
Many thanks.
We're sorry for the trouble.
You should tell that to your club members.
That's true.
Well, good luck.
Pardon?
Nothing.
Ah, there they are.
Are we done?
Yup, thanks for helping.
Let's call it a day.
Are you sure?
Well, you know...
You're right.
It'd also be better for Saki to settle down a little more.
Bye.
Yeah.
So, shall we grab some food?
Sure, it'd be a good way to finish up.
Where to?
How about some beef bowl from Handaya?
Or cabbage fried rice at Soukutsuya.
I'm for kiev style cutlet at Chiruchiru.
W-Want to sing?
No singing!
Ehhh!
Volunteer work schedule
That can't be!
T-This sucks.
So much for Comic Fest.
All three days.
Man...
No.
Just one of us has the 30th free.
I don't suppose you're going to suggest another penalty game.
No, this is a request.
No! No, this is a request.
But even if Kasukabe did that for us,
she'd probably just get more mainstream dojinshi.
We can always just buy that kind afterwards at dojin shops.
No, there's also Comic Fest-specific limited editions!
That's why someone must go in person!
I know better than that.
Your ultimate goal isn't to buy dojinshi, it's to use them.
You'd make me be your gopher for something like that?
She's a tough one.
If you understand us that well, I'll get to the point.
Here it comes.
If I may be so bold!
It's always gotta be some big production.
A winter break without new books from Comic Fest...
And when it's that boring, we're of course going to spend it doing you-know-what!
In other words, nothing but m- m-m...the whole time!
Wham.
She really punched him.
Like her arm just extended.
This is volunteer work, and the last time...
I'll go!
So, this is the first Kujiun series summarization meeting.
Wasn't it the New Year's/ Genshiken is back in business party?
Well, it certainly did take a long time to come home!
All kinds of volunteer work, forced labor, working for free, compulsory service!
You can stop making it sound like all I did was go buy dojinshi.
I worked at a nursery.
So anyway, yes, let's stop talking about that and cut! Right?
Tokino!
Tokino!
Please come over, Tokino! We're waiting for you!
Come on!
What can you see from there?
What I can see from here is...
A view I'm sure we've never seen before!
This is it! This is the quality I wanted to see!
The sale date got pushed back again and again...
But this changes my opinion of Yamabata now.
T-These days only a-artist type directors tend to stand out.
Like Aizawa and Seki.
Yeah, they're a bit over-hyped.
Their tricks are too obvious and polished.
I'll say.
It shows we need to pay more respect towards these...
It's the same as ever.
Yes, it is.
I've got something I need to say, if now's a good time.
What is it?
Well, h-how to say this...
Um...
Might I retire as chairman?
Huh?
W-What brought this on?
Well, I guess, this seemed like a good stopping point.
I'm not too sure.
Oh really?
Just come out and say it...
Someone's been causing too many problems and you're tired of it!
Uh, no, I was afraid to say it since I thought you'd take it that way.
Besides.
I have to start job hunting this year.
Job hunting?
Knock off the harmony, you two! Job hunting?
Well, I think it could be good timing, not really too early.
It's January, after all.
True...
And so, as for my successor...
I'd like Sasahara to do it.
Eh?
W-Why me?
I'm not suited at all, am I?
Hmm, well, you don't look like you've ever been in charge of anything before.
Of course not!
But, when I look at these faces...
There's no generalized otaku there but you.
One of them isn't even otaku at all.
Why not?
It was process of elimination the last time too.
It's a tradition.
N-Not a very good one.
Well, we have Kasukabe's stamp of approval...
Okay!
So new chairman, tell us your ambitions.
Ah, all right...
Now that I've become chairman...
Kind of like Madarame.
Shut up! Kind of like Madarame.
Just once I'd like to see us participate as a circle at Comic Fest!
Oh?
Ah, he said it.
I'm not involved.
What's the big deal?
Participate as a circle?
It means becoming a seller at Comic Fest.
Making dojinshi.
Are you thinking gaku-man for a genre?
What's gaku-man?
It means a school's manga club.
Is there a series you wanted to parody? It means a school's manga club.
Is there a series you wanted to parody?
A series I want to do?
If we're going to do this, I want to do a male-oriented offset-printed Kujiun book!
Male-oriented?
Uh, um, umm umm...
Umm, uh, uhhh...
Never mind, I get it.
Suioh University Entrance Exam Site
What?
You're alone.
I'm meeting someone.
I see.
Oh, yes. Good job on things.
Various things.
You fit in well over there.
Didn't Kugayama draw it?
Why not a sketch of Yamada?
Well, it's my personal preference.
I still don't know what direction the story will take in the end.
What's up?
Yo.
What's that?
The Comic Fest application.
Really.
If we're accepted, will you be a salesgirl?
Sounds like fun, but I'll pass.
If you think it sounds like fun...
If I did it, I'm sure I'd take the money like this, like it's dirty.
Still, really doing the application...
I guess, I've longed vaguely for this...
It's like maybe I really did want to do this.
Come to think of it, dojinshi were part of why I joined Genshiken.
Yeah, what a surprise.
And now, here you are applying to Comic Fest.
Have I gone up or down?
Come on. Down, obviously!
And oh yeah, that was when Kasukabe hit me for the first time.
Wow, that takes me back.
You've got a good memory.
I mean, sorry!
You shouldn't hit people when you first meet them.
No, it's all right.
Well, I'm sure I've turned out the way I was meant to.
How I joined Genshiken then, how I'm chairman of it now...
Might as well keep going until I get there...
Oh, yeah, what should we do about our circle name?
Hmm, The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture's no good.
Of course not, we're applying as totally male-oriented.
Guess the abbreviation's out, too.
I wouldn't say it's completely out, but it's not that good.
Let's think of something weird, then.
How about Genshiken in hiragana?
Ahh, good idea.
Yeah, yeah, a subtly dubious sound might be the ticket.
Hello.
Howdy.
You're just in time to see a legend born.
Like what?
Kasukabe did the naming.
Don't go nuts on me.
Nice sound.
G-Good sense.
Being told I have good sense for this kind of thing makes me really nervous.
It's all good, it's all good.
I'll hit you.
That aside, take a look at this.
Let's see.
Oh awesome!
Who did the original?
M-Manta. From Sangakudou.
Ahh, I see.
It's out already? I could have sworn...
Genshiken
We took no detours or shortcuts...
Only vivid dreams extended deep into the shadows.
We aren't quite grown up.
Simple but complicated glistening like marbles.
The time we spied from there sparkled, even if nothing big happened.
What we see from the marbles in our hands now is a little different...
It was boring and ridiculous. It wasn't even worth watching!
The light and shadow of youth? Who wrote this embarrassing stuff?
But Mistress Renko, you spoke your part so well.
It moved me!
D-Don't be stupid!
That was just part of the script, and it wasn't how I really felt.
You really are a fool if you don't realize that.
Then you really are mean, Mistress Renko.
What, that again...
Kujibiki Unbalance, the final tournament.
Mean Mistress Renko is finally going to be active again!
Stop referring to me that way...
