Say, Nana Komatsu.
We used to spend so much time together,
but I didn't understand you one bit.
Well, you see... to understand you is usually impossible!
So give me a break, will you?
Blinking eyes call the wind
A smile clears all the noise away
The angel in your eyes whispers
Everything begins now
Can you feel it now Can you feel it now
It's like being caught in a wave
Pulling on my heart Pulling on my heart
Breath held, arms reaching out
Baby this world is different from yesterday's
You're the only one I can see
Baby my wish on a wing
This sky is torn
By a single overflowing word
Long time no see. I wonder what customers we'll have today.
Wow! I've wanted to come here for so long! Junko's room!
Um, who are you?
Why is a guy with a bigger role here?!
Could it possibly be, you're here because...
- Naoki, is your role in jeopardy?! - Naoki, is your role in jeopardy?!
Papa-rakkyo!
Oh, don't worry about this.
He's like a zashiki warashi or jizo statue of Junko's room.
Really?
Who are you calling a jizo statue?!
You know, I'm being treated terribly lately.
In the last Junko's room, I was here...
- By the way, isn't Hachiko here today? - but didn't have a single line.
By Hachiko, do you mean Nana Komatsu?
Yeah. I hear she's quite something.
She's not only a great strategist, but she's a great cook and great in bed.
In addition, she thinks of Takumi and Takumi only.
- Um... - I wonder about that.
Huh?
Why don't we watch the video?
Hey, Hachi...
That Takumi is so annoying. Hachi is our pet.
Don't talk of her like she's a dog.
But doesn't it piss you off? Get her back, Nobu.
You like Hachi, don't you?
It may have very well happened in the heat of the moment,
but knowing Hachi, she may become more and more serious about him.
But if Takumi continues treating this relationship in that manner,
Hachi is obviously gonna get hurt.
Are you okay with that, Nobu? I don't like it one bit.
If you want her, go for it.
I'm sorry about suddenly coming over last night
and blurting out weird nonsense.
So, now that I've come to see you like this again,
this time I'm gonna be direct with you.
I love you.
I know that I'm not being fair by saying this now.
Since I know about you and Takumi.
I'm sorry. You didn't come to the studio today
even if you wanted to because of what I said, right?
I'm sorry, that's not it! I was working today!
I don't mind, so please drop by like you've been doing.
Everyone feels a bit lonely without your presence, Hachi.
Actually, it's me who gets sad.
Thank you.
Thank goodness.
That's good enough for me.
Nobu! Thank you for walking me home.
Huh?
I'll be fine on my own from here on. I'm almost home.
I'm sorry for having you take a longer route home
in order to walk me home every day.
No, I don't mind it.
Nana!
Well, well. It's you.
Well, thank you very much for that.
Okay, then. Thank you, Nobu.
Good night.
I can't take it anymore.
What's the matter?
Nothing! It's none of your business!
Um, sorry. Please leave me alone.
Shin.
A man and a woman are simply opposing creatures
driven toward each other by lust.
Can they be connected by love?
Sorry, I don't know either.
- Yes. - Takumi,.,
I wanna see you.
Nana...
- Thank you! - F-For what?
I thought you would never talk to me again.
So I'm glad that you came tonight.
What are you talking about?
That's nonsense. Of course I'd talk to you.
I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizing? You've done nothing wrong.
That's not true.
The truth is... I'm a really horrible woman!
What's this about being a horrible woman?
A really horrible woman?
But it's true. You're idealizing me for sure, Nobu!
Otherwise there's no way you'd fall in love with me!
If you knew the real me...
you'd be disappointed.
Then, disappoint me.
I want you to.
Because I don't know what else I can do to stop loving you.
I'm sorry. I'll break it off with Takumi.
I really didn't want anyone to know about what happened with Takumi.
I thought, then I could act like nothing happened
and become your girlfriend.
I had such cunning thoughts. Lots of them.
Do you hate me now?
Huh?
No. I'm happy.
I can't take you from him by force.
I can't have you do something that'll make you a horrible woman.
I don't find you cunning.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It can't be helped that you're attracted to Takumi.
And no matter how hard I try,
I'll probably never be able to compete with him.
That's not true! I!
But if you tell me that
you're still gonna break it off with him and be my woman...
I'll do everything I can to make you happy.
For the sake of your happiness, I will do everything within my power.
I mean, with you by my side, I feel like I can do anything.
When you break it off with Takumi... and sort out your feelings...
then come to me.
I'll be waiting faithfully.
Sorry, I have to go now.
I'll call you when I have some time.
You don't have to!
In fact, don't ever call me again!
Huh?
Goodbye!
Hi there!
Stop startling me!
I told you yesterday.
Put an end to things first, and then come to me.
But I did. That's why I came.
Too fast!
Nana...
Hmm?
You know, I... Nobu...
I think I'm head over heels in love with Nobu.
Isn't it natural?
Huh? Nobu and Takumi?
Um, Nana Osaki and Ren of our band are back together.
She lives with Hachiko, and...
Lately, the relationships are becoming so confusing.
Hey, look here!
It's a diagram of the character relationships in the anime, Nana,
that I made to clarify things.
Wow!
It doesn't really clarify anything.
Huh? Naoki's not connected to anyone.
Huh?
Wh-What are you saying! I'm Yasu's best friend!
Even now, he's supposed to be meeting me...
FROM: YASU I HAVE OTHER PLANS STOP CALLING ME OVER AND OVER!
Is he really your best friend?
Sure he is!
Come to think of it, he said this.
MR. Y. T. (AGE 23) OF TOKYO How are you doing? I'm glad I could finally see you!
Because you were being such a pest.
And there also was this comment.
MR. T. I. (AGE 23) OF TOKYO Then go home. Our band can make it without you, Naoki.
Why?! Why do you two know so much?!
Junko's room is that sorta place.
That's right.
No matter who says what, Yasu and I are best friends!
- I'm gonna draw one! - Ahh!
- I'm gonna draw a line here! - Don't do it!
Now he's completely isolated.
You are pregnant.
This small black circle you see is the sack that contains your baby.
And the little dot you see inside it is your baby.
Morning sickness?
I won't keep it, so don't worry!
There's no need for you to feel responsible, Takumi.
I'm the foolish one. This child could be my boyfriend's.
Go home.
And don't come back again.
Is your boyfriend Nobu?
Takumi?
What are you doing?
Takumi...
NOBU
Don't tell Nobu!
What is it?
Hey, can you hear me?
Yes.
Nana's pregnant.
I don't know if it's yours or mine, but regardless,
if Nana wants to keep it,
I intend on becoming its guardian and raising it as my own.
What do you think?
Nana... Is it true that you're pregnant?
Hey...
I wanna hear it directly from you.
It could be my child. There's no need to hide it from me.
And I knew that you had just broken things off with Takumi.
I'm sorry.
Why...
are you apologizing?
Didn't you break it off with him?!
Please make up an excuse.
I don't care if it's a lie. I'll believe you.
I'm sorry!
I wanna have this child and raise it as your child, Takumi.
If it's okay with you.
Wanna get married?
Huh?
If I marry an ordinary girl, the media won't go too crazy over this.
No?
Married?
So I'm sorry, but... could you find a new roommate?
But sure, that's not fair to you having her move out so suddenly,
so I'll pay half the rent until you find a new roommate.
I don't need it!
I can't stand the thought of you doing it with some other man.
Don't you worry about a thing and just focus on pleasing me.
You're a lot more important to me than my boyfriend, Nana.
I think I'm head over heels in love with Nobu.
Could you find a new roommate?
If you don't like it, I don't want it either. I wanna use it as a set.
Why don't you use the strawberry glass?
Because there are only two of them. What if I break one?
But if you don't use them, what's the point of having them?
Yeah, but still, it's too sad if one of a set breaks.
You can use it, but be sure to be careful, okay?
Nana?
Leave her alone.
TO NANA
TO NANA
What's this?
Hachi!
Hachiko, are you here?
I can't count how many nights
I wished tomorrow would never come
To live as I am without being fake
What do I need
If I don't believe in myself, what can I believe in
The answer is too close to see
Black tears are falling down
I have nothing, only sadness
I can't put it into words
My whole body starts to ache
I can't stand it anymore on my own
So there you have it.
Did you enjoy the third installment of Junko's room?
Until we meet again some day.
- Bye-bye. - Huh? Wait a minute.
Good bye.
I-I-I should have more lines. Huh? Huh? Wait!
