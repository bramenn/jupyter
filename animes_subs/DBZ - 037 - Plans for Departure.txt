Yow!
Science
Gohan- chan, you're goin' to catch up with everythin' that you've fallen behind on.
Anything but that!
What's the matter, Kuririn? You're trembling.
I- it's nothing.
Oww!
All we're doing is changing his bandages. What a loud patient this is.
On second thought, I shouldn't be here. We have to find that Saiyan spaceship quickly.
Let Bulma handle that. You need to hurry and recover from your injuries.
B- but...
We never know when that Saiyan is going to attack again.
You need to completely recover before that happens.
Gohan- chan is not havin' anythin' to do with that anymore!
I'm not lettin' him get into any more dangerous situations like that again!
Next, please.
M- my injuries aren't all that serious, so...
Neither are mine!
Now, look here!
You've got to get treated properly, or you're not goin' to get any better!
Come on, Gohan- chan!
No, anything but this!
Wow, we're lucky.
They said that after Gohan and I spend three days in the hospital, we'll be fine.
You've got me beat. They said it would be four months before my injuries heal.
They also said I might not be back to my former self.
Hey, not to worry. In another month, I'll have some new Senzu beans.
You know, you look just like a mummy in there.
Tch! I went through all that nastiness, and they ain't even gonna keep me here.
You're just after the hospital's food, aren't you?
When Yajirobe thought he was going to be done in by that Saiyan,
he was like, Sorry'bout that! I got lotsa respect for ya! Lemme be your friend!
Why, you! What're ya talkin''bout!?
I was just sayin' that to get him off his guard!
Well, in any case, you all really done well!
Nothin' could make me happier. And everyone who's dead is comin' back to life, too.
Mm-hmm, that is, if we can get to Planet Namek.
It will be all right, that's for sure!
Hey, everyone! The TV! Watch the TV!
Oh, it's you, Bulma! I thought you were some weird nurse.
Shut up, would you? Here, watch the TV.
According to those who found it, this object,
which was discovered in the devastation of Metro East,
appears to be a vehicle that came from space, though that cannot be determined.
That's the Saiyan's!
It sure is!
I- I can't see!
Apparently, when this object was found, there were two of them,
but soon after, one of them suddenly flew away from the scene.
This is bad. Those scientists have already carried it away.
W- what do we do?
This should be interesting.
Let's use the remote control that Kuririn brought back, and call it here!
That will surprise them, I'm sure.
Are you sure that's going to work?
What are you talking about? I'm a genius! I thoroughly checked it out last night.
Watch this.
It's nice that we can watch it right here on TV, huh? Okay, beep, beep, beep...
Ready? It's going to start moving...
I want to see, too!
W - what in the world could have happened here!?
T - the object suddenly exploded! What happened?
There is wreckage from the object all over!
It can't be!
W- why? Could that have been the self-destruct switch?
What do we do!? Without that spaceship, we can't go to Planet Namek!
Our last hope...
Completely wiped out.
I- it's hopeless now...
This is a problem. I probably couldn't get there using Kinto Un, either.
This is your fault for picking up strange remote controls!
Bulma- san, you're the one who was hasty to push those switches.
Well...
Hey.
Mister Popo!
Hey there.
W- what the!?
Someone come with me. There is spaceship.
A- a spaceship? You really have one, Popo- san?
Probably.
-W- who is that? -Mister Popo.
Mister Popo?
He stays at Kami- sama's place.
But he's been there at Kami's palace
since long before this current Kami- sama was ever there.
Say, what do you mean, probably ?
Probably, it is...
Someone come with me to check. Mister Popo show way.
Bulma- san!
-Me!? -Well, Bulma- san,
nobody else would know if it's a spaceship.
Bulma- san?
Would I be all right? I mean, doesn't that man have a dangerous look in his eye?
-What is that!? -There's someone riding it! -What is it!?
Bulma, what's taking you so long? Hurry and hop on!
Oh, no! Save me!
I'm falling down!
I'm done for! I'm going to die!
We're counting on you, Bulma!
Be careful. I'm not like those guys. I'm delicate, okay?
Okay, we go.
Easy... easy, now...
H- how did he do that just now?
Still, what kind of spaceship is it? Could there really be one?
Here.
Already?
Get off.
W- where is this? It's pretty cold.
Yunzabit Highlands.
Y- Yunzabit!?
That's the ends of the earth, you know!
You mean, we came this far in that one instant?
Here, maybe...
This way, maybe...
W- wait up!
Say, do you mean there's something like a spaceship here?
Hey, are you listening to me?
You haven't brought me here to this far-flung place...
H- hang on!
Hurry up.
Y- you're kidding, right? I can't do that!
Geez...
This thing.
Is this spaceship?
I- I'll have to examine it...
What is this? It's not metal. Could this be?
Hang on, what's going on? Tell me what this is, exactly!
About 100 years ago, Kami- sama told Mister Popo of old times.
Strange story.
Kami- sama said lived here in Yunzabit when child. Mister Popo asked him...
Yunzabit remote region. People not live there, so why you there?
I don't know why I was there. I must have hit my head,
and lost all of my memories up to that point.
Had no parents?
No, I didn't. All I had was a letter that said they would be coming later.
What does that mean? I don't see where this story is going.
Kami- sama as child waited long time for parents. Not knew what happened, but waited.
I had my house there in Yunzabit, after all.
I trusted that my parents would surely return there.
However, no matter how long I waited, nobody ever came. It was hard on me.
There was hardly anything there to eat, either. How long did I wait there?
20 years? No, it must have been 30 years.
Finally, I gave up, and, leaving my house behind, I left Yunzabit.
Once in a while, I went back to see how it was doing, but there was never any change.
So, what does that have to do with this?
You impatient. Here come point of story.
But you know, thinking back on it now, it was a strange house.
I didn't realize it until I had learned more about the world,
but that house was really quite unusual.
It was round, with four legs, and looked almost like an insect.
Its door didn't have any knobs or locks, but would open when a word was spoken to it.
Piccolo.
An entrance!
Get up on there.
This is Kami- sama's house?
Say again to close.
Piccolo.
Look close. This not house, but rather, spaceship?
That's right! Kami- sama is a Namekian!
That Kaio person said that long ago,
Planet Namek went through some abnormal weather, and they nearly died out.
Mister Popo also heard Kaio- sama's voice speaking.
Then remembered story of this house.
Thought what if, came here searching, and this here.
If this really is a spaceship, then your story earlier would indeed be consistent.
When Planet Namek had bad time,
Kami- sama's parents put child Kami- sama aboard, sent to Earth.
His parents meant to escape afterward, when they were able to,
but there was some kind of accident...
which is to say, they died...
That's it! After all, no matter how you look at this thing, it doesn't seem like a house.
This has to be a spaceship!
But even if that's so, can we use it or not?
The door moved, so it has to have power, right?
Is this the main switch?
Nope. Well, what about this?
It's not this, either.
That's odd. I wonder if there's a code number or something.
Sure, that's it. If it worked as easily as that,
then when Kami- sama was a child, he would have tried pushing them, too.
It looks like this thing doesn't work using switches.
I wonder if Bulma- san will really find anything for us.
All we can do now is pray.
We're counting on you, Bulma. This is for everyone.
I don't get it.
Could it be some kind of sensor?
Voice?
Yes! Like with the entrance! Words!
Say what? Piccolo ?
Not that! After all, that's the password you use for going in and out.
Work! Do you hear me? Fly! Let me see you fly!
It's no use. The language is different. You have to speak Namekian.
After all, back at that Tenkaichi Tournament,
Kami- sama and Piccolo spoke in that strange language.
That must be the Namekian language.
Supposing that Namekian language, Mister Popo knows those words.
Really!?
Really. Piccolo means other world in those words. That why password for door.
Why didn't you say so sooner?
So that's it. Piccolo Daimao means the Demon King of Another World.
Try saying something in Namekian. Tell it to fly.
Fly where?
Anywhere is fine!
I know, how about around Jupiter for now?
It says acknowledged.
What is this!? Doesn't this spaceship have any safety belts!?
What is that thing!?
Just now, you said want to go toilet in Namekian.
You said safety belt, right?
This is all too complicated! We have to be careful what we say!
Complicated means time for bed.
Incredible! It's Jupiter! This is an incredible spaceship!
We did it! We did it, we did it!
Thank goodness. Now Kami- sama come back to life.
A spaceship has been found.
Now all that remains is a departure for Planet Namek.
