The truth is, I want to be by your side more than anyone else
Lets go take a walk in chains of love!
The Silver Advent Festival
The Silver Advent Festival
Next Time
The Farewell Wedding Ceremony
So the Silver Advent Festival is your New Year's festival.
We're in the middle of war.
Do the people in the city of South Goth not have any pride,
welcoming their enemy and all?
Not only did the Albion forces not protect their people, but they also ran away with the town's food supply, right?
The Tristain forces gave food to the people in their stead,
Why are you only capable of thinking like that?
Plebeians are plebeians, after all.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well yeah, I'm different from aristocrats.
I prefer festivals to war.
Fine, then go enjoy yourself!
I'll go see the Princess by myself!
Hey, wait!
I don't need a dog following me!
Louise!
Louise, where's Saito-san?
Saito is...
I've given him a task, so I'll hear the mission in his stead.
I see.
There was something that I wanted to ask Saito-san, but...
The other day, we recovered Saito-san's vehicle from the mountain...
Zero, was it?
Can it be operated right now?
U-Um...
If it's an order, we'll do something about it.
As you know, per Albion's proposal, we'll be in a truce during the Silver Advent Festival.
But you never know. They might attempt a surprise attack.
Therefore, we'd like you to fly to the capital, Londinium, and spy on them.
Understood.
We will be the ones breaking the truce if we use a dragon from our Air Force.
On the other hand, you two can say that you're students if you were to get caught by any chance.
The results from the last mission were pitiful,
but I'm sure you two can do fine if it's just scouting.
We will not fail you.
Please don't be rash.
Yes.
This is hard without Colbert-sensei.
Julio, I have a favour to ask of you.
You got it.
I didn't ask anything yet.
If it's a favour for my beautiful Louise, I'll fulfil it no matter what.
So?
I heard that you are a dragon knight in the Musketeer Force but haven't joined Tristain's military, right?
I haven't since I'm a flamen from Romalia.
What's he doing?
Ready?
Louise, what are you doing?!
Going on a date, of course.
Would you not bother us?
Date?!
It's a mission!
We're off on a secret mission by order of the Princess!
In that case, get on my Zero!
That can't fly right now.
W-Well, I can fix it in a rush.
Besides, you don't want to help out with the war effort, right?
I don't need a familiar who only complains!
Go wherever you want!
Goodbye!
Well, let's go.
Excuse us, Saito-kun.
Louise!
Are you okay with that?
With what?
Saito-kun.
He was hurt.
I don't care about him.
He won't understand me at all.
Damn her.
Damn her!
Damn Louise.
Why won't she understand me?
Saito... san?
Huh? Siesta?
Saito-san!
I never imagined I'd see you here!
I'm so happy!
Why are you here in Albion?
The school's closed for a while,
and I have an uncle who's starting a business here,
so I had him bring me with him.
Oh, your uncle.
Oh, no!
Saito-chan!
Don't tell me M-Master Scarron is your uncle...
T-That's him.
Who are you calling an uncle, huh?
I'm sorry, young lady.
And what's this? Saito and Siesta were friends?
Yes, well, we know each other from the Magic Academy...
What? Then the boy Siesta said she wanted to look for in Albion,
the great person whom she loves unrequitedly, but wants to get no matter what,
is Saito?!
Hey, hey, hey,
hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!
Hey!
Saito, you playboy!
Two-tim-ing Louise-chan?
A love triangle?!
No...
Come to think of it, Miss Valliere isn't with you?
She's...
Doesn't look like they're preparing to march out or anything.
Yeah...
Surrender, you say?
Do you guys intend to betray your country?
N-No, we're only saying that we should consider it a possibility.
If we focus on defence, we should be able to withstand them for a while.
However, we lack sufficient force to attack with.
It's no matter how much force we have.
I was able to get some results, but there is no longer any merit in using this country further.
You asked me to take part in this mission for Saito-kun's sake, didn't you?
For Saito's sake?
You can't force a pacifist to go to war and put him in a dangerous situation, right?
I don't care about that dog.
You don't have to blush.
You want Saito-kun to be safe even if you were to die in war.
You care about him so much, but he just doesn't understand.
That's why you're angry.
I'm...
Oops, looks like chatting time is over.
Azuro.
Hey, what do you plan on doing?
You'll bite your tongue if you talk.
Breath!
End of mission.
Let's go back, shall we?
You didn't kill them.
How kind of you to worry about their well-being.
I wonder if it's Saito-kun's influence.
It's nothing like that!
Cheers!
But what a surprise that you are the boy that Siesta loves!
Well...
I feel bad for Louise, but I think I have to root for my cousin.
Cousin?
Oh, yeah.
They're alike, I guess.
Everyone in our family has big breasts.
See? Me, too.
Isn't that muscle?
Saito! Isn't that Saito?
Guiche!
Y-You're...
What is it?
Oh, this?
This is a White Spirit Medal.
It's not much, but I was distinguished on the battlefield.
General Poitier gave it to me in person.
Wow...
To an aristocrat, there is no greater honour!
I'm back.
Saito?
Gosh, even when your master's back and all...
Hey!
Woah, what?
Where's Saito?
Huh? Wasn't he with you?
I see. You acted coldly to him again, didn't you?
And then Partner went away with a bitter face.
I wasn't being cold to him.
So I was right.
I don't care about him!
He shouldn't talk back to me.
He should just follow the orders I give him.
Yes...
He says he loves you.
That's got nothing to do with it!
Oh, really?
Partner gave up on going home and joined the war to follow you.
Though he doesn't want to get involved in it.
Why do you think that is?
Because he's my familiar...
Because he loves you.
Have you ever responded to his feelings, even once?
While he devotes himself to you,
isn't whipping the only thing you do to him?
Oh, where's Louise?
She's not with you?
I don't care.
Oh, and I thought I'd show her the medal.
Why don't you go call her, then?
You know... Deep down, I'm really grateful to him.
But he's my familiar and a man.
Without my having to tell him so every time,
he should understand how I feel.
You're asking for the impossible.
He seems to be lacking in relationship experience.
And if the war continues, and if I were to die in it, he would never understand.
That's why. Instead of keeping it inside, why don't you tell him exactly how you feel?
And make a solid bond with him while you're alive.
Bond?
How do I do that?
This is what you say.
I love you! I love you, Saito!
Please! Marry me!
M-Marry?!
Make me your bride, make love to me!
Pamper me!
You're scary.
You think an aristocrat could say l-love and m-marry me and m-make love to me...
That is the problem.
Partner says that in the world he comes from, there are no plebeians nor aristocrats.
That's why he doesn't understand your standpoint.
I know! Why don't you two swap positions for a day?
Swap positions?
You'll become Saito's familiar.
What?!
Yup, that's a great idea.
You will be able to come to a good understanding if you do.
Understanding?
A-ha. It's that room, isn't it?
Will Saito really be happy with this outfit?
Definitely!
Partner's simple-minded, so he'll be emotionally touched to know how much you love him.
Hey, he's back.
You're... y-you're my master tonight! Meow, meow!
What are you doing?
Ah, Louise, you were adorable.
Yup, yup, really.
If you're on the floor in that outfit, you'll get lots of customers.
I won't lose!
Siesta?
Geez... I wondered what you were doing while I was gone.
To tell you the truth, Partner,
she was...
S-So you know, it wasn't for you, okay?!
Then who was it for?
U-Um...
J-Julio!
Stupid Delflinger said that if I wear the cat outfit and say,
You're my master for the night, meow,
I could make Julio fall for me.
Right?
Well...
Right?!
Yes!
Are you serious about that?
Of course I'm serious!
He's superior to you in looks, brains and swordsmanship.
His dragon-controlling ability was godly.
Compared to him, you're a pinworm to his lion,
fly to his phoenix,
water flea to his swan!
I get it!
Then enjoy your time with Julio!
Hey, looks like everyone's here.
Julio...
I-I'm going back!
Hold.
What's wrong?
No, let me go!
Saito-kun, did something happen?
Like I'd know!
Saito-pyon!
S-Siesta?
Hey, who's cuter, Miss Valliere or me?
Who is it?
W-Who, you ask...
What is this outfit?! Trying to mock me?!
A maid dares to make fun of me?!
No, I only want Saito-san to be happy.
Ah, stop it, both of you.
Keep it up, Siesta!
Damn this!
Magistrate Sheffield, can we really use the secret measure for repelling the enemy here?
A third of South Gotha's water supply comes from here.
That is...!
The ring of Andvari.
It controls both the living and the dead.
I must have the war continue.
Who exactly are you?
General. Do the rest as we planned.
I leave Albion in your hands.
Magistrate!
Fairy, you say?!
Does that mean a cute girl like me?
No! A real fairy!
Yeah, a fairy...
I really saw one!
It happened when we encountered an enemy while marching from Lowscythe.
When I noticed, I was surrounded by enemies in the mountain.
I was killed.
I was surely inflicted a fatal wound.
However...
When I woke up again,
my body didn't have a single scar.
Thank you, fairy-san!
Maybe you had a dream.
Humans are likely to see strange dreams when they're faced with death.
It wasn't a dream!
Either way, I'm glad you're alive.
It's frightening to die in war, in an unknown land.
No, no, I'm an aristocrat.
I'm not afraid of dying.
I can die any time I'm asked to for the sake of honour.
But if possible, I'd like to be more recognised, so I can die with another medal on me.
Are you an idiot?!
W-What did you call me?
I don't get it, but you came back after nearly dying, right?
Then cherish that life!
Dying for the sake of honour? That's garbage!
Saito! Apologise to Guiche!
Why?
Honour is more important than life to aristocrats!
How many times do I have to tell you until you understand that?
You, too! Why won't you understand me?!
Everything ends when you die no matter how many medals you get!
I don't need medals.
What's important is loyalty to the Princess.
I don't need anyone to recognise me.
I only need the Princess to understand me.
That is my honour.
I would gladly give my life if it's for her!
Suit yourself, then!
Saito-san...
Listen, Partner.
About the cat outfit...
It wasn't for Julio, but...
I don't care about Julio!
What?
I get it now.
My true rival for Louise is... the Princess!
Saito-san!
Please wait!
Siesta?
A-Are you angry at me?
I'm troubling you, following you all the way to Albion, right?
No, not at all...
I'm cold.
I'm freezing.
Are you all right?
Man, I drank too much.
Henrietta's men are your enemies.
Kill your enemies.
Kill your enemies!
So, do you feel warmer?
I'm hot.
I told a lie.
I wasn't cold at all to begin with.
It's just that... I wanted to feel your warmth.
Siesta...
I love you!
Stupid Saito.
When will he understand me?
I want a stronger bond, not just one between master and familiar.
What was that?
Your Highness, there's a revolt!
Some of our own men are assaulting our soldiers!
What ridiculous things are you saying?
Watch out!
General Poitier!
Something strange is happening outside.
Saito-san...
You'll return to Miss Valliere's side, won't you?
W-Well...
Please take this with you, then.
It's a sleeping potion.
If Miss Valliere tries to make you do something dangerous,
make her take this, and run away while she's asleep.
Siesta...
It may be natural for aristocrats to die for the Princess,
but I can't stand having you get caught up in it!
What? What's going on?
Saito!
Where's Saito?
Saito!
You dog!
This is goodbye,
so... I'll marry you!
Zero no Tsukaima. Futatsuki no Kishi.
The Farewell Wedding Ceremony.
If you want to meet me again next week, then sit tightly and wait!
