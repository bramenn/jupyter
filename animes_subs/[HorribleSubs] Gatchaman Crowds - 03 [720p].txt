Is the data accurate?
Yes... Although I don't know why.
Ever since then, MESS has stopped
all harmful activity toward human society.
Ohhh... Is this a reaction, too?
Don't tell me! You love origami, too?
All the absorbed humans have been safely returned, as well.
No way!
That's way too awesome!
Case closed!
We can't let down our guard just yet!
They just stopped doing anything;
they haven't stopped making an appearance.
C'mon, can't you just be happy, Pai-Pai?
Don't call me Pai-Pai!
Oh, do you prefer Pai-san, after all?
You're messing with me.
So you're saying that no one's been abducted since then?
Yes. No one since.
Huh? What?
Not What?!
What'd you do to it back there?
I just thought I'd make it cute.
Hey, doesn't it seem like it's communicating with Hajime-chan?
Oh, it's MESSY-chan.
Why are you introducing it to us?!
I mean, don't even name it!
There's no way anyone can communicate with a MESS...
Wh-What?
Its shape-changing might have something to do with this.
Oh, we collaborated with our scissors.
Oh, that must be it!
Change the body's shape to exchange information, maybe?
Maybe that's how they communicate.
That's way too far-fetched!
But, it's strange.
Why did all the MESS act as one, at the same time?
Maybe they can share information.
What?
So, just like with this NOTE,
information might be transmitted instantaneously.
They might be a life form with a hive mind.
That's kind of sexy!
How?!
Forget it!
My orders were to exterminate!
But when we try to catch it, it vanishes.
That's impossible!
Aww, so cute!
Maybe MESS-chan never had any animosity toward us in the first place,
and just didn't realize we were around.
Impossible!
Ouch...
They've clearly been doing harm until recently!
Oh, no! I've stepped on an ant!
Kind of like that?
Even a philanthropist like me might do that while I'm walking about.
You don't mean...
From their perspective, we're like ants?
Ants might be giving us a lot of credit.
Might be more like rocks.
Way too sad!
I'm dreamy...
Th-Then, what we've been doing until now is...
A waste, right?
That's being way too harsh!
But it's spot-on!
Well, it's true that we did save people...
Well, compared to our Gatchaman predecessors,
we're pathetic enough.
Aw, now my shoulders are tense.
Please keep it together, Leader.
Oh, are you interested?
I'll give this to you, then.
Here!
I'm dreamy...
That's a troublesome neighbor you've got there.
We have a baby, so, of course, the baby will cry.
But the neighbor says we're being too loud
and playing music with the volume cranked way up...
They might both be unwanted noise,
but for entirely different reasons.
Things have escalated recently.
Even at night, the neighbor honks the car horn.
It's enough to make my baby seize up.
Maybe you should lodge a complaint.
You mean, take legal action?
But I have no experience in that sort of thing...
Why don't you ask X?
You're right. I will.
What may I help you with?
May I?
Civil lawsuits aren't too much trouble.
What?
If you'd like,
Someone's having neighbor issues. Please help!
Join Close
I can give you counsel.
Are you a lawyer?
Yes. First, tell me what's happening, in detail.
It's not heroes who'll update the world. It's us.
Seriously?
You're a GALAXter, too, Marippu?
That sounds like trash (garakuta).
Hey!
Fine, fine.
You're asking me if I'm a GALAX user, right?
Of course, I am.
It comes in handy, doesn't it?
GALAX is good stuff.
The info you can get from the X app is pretty useful.
Hey, isn't that scary?
There's got to be flame wars and stuff, right?
It's all fine.
They're good at managing it.
They match users up in a good way.
Just give it a try.
Let's update the world together!
What's that?
I'm back.
Were you able to secure a sufficient caloric intake?
Yes.
Update.
A balanced diet is very important.
Good health is essential for realizing your ambitions.
Very nice, X.
You've become good at managing GALAX, too.
Thank you, Milord Rui.
Hm?
There has been a noticeable
decline in job seekers, given the lack of economic recovery
and effective policies for the foreseeable feature.
In actuality, job seekers appear to be relying, not on agencies,
but on GALAX.
Basically, it's a problem of matching job seekers with employers.
If they can contact each other directly online,
why would they need a middle man?
Our active users are continuing to increase today.
That means the number of people who resent us will also increase.
The more powerful the enemy,
the more enjoyable the game, perhaps?
Missing Persons Simultaneously Found Across the Nation
Well, I'm the one who's shocked.
When I came to, I was standing on my usual way home,
but I was told it's been more than six months.
Not just this man,
but others who had gone missing are being found across the country.
They all have no memory of the lost time.
What, what?
Were they abducted by aliens?
No way.
Prime Minister Resigning
This just in.
Prime Minister Kamoshida, who had been urged to take responsibility
for his cabinet members' multiple scandals,
indicated his intent to resign today.
We'll be reporting live from the prime minister's residence...
Aww... and this one'd started off with high approval ratings, too.
Congratulations, Rui.
Stage clear, isn't it?
He wasn't really a boss character...
The world's so complicated now that even excellent leaders
might not be enough to turn things around.
Then, who is the true enemy...
Who is it? One of the Hundred?
An incoming call from Number 26.
Him...
It's probably to ask for usage permission, I'm sure.
Shall I handle him?
Sorry, yeah.
What a waste, Rui-Rui.
Are you being stingy with that valuable power of yours?
I did give them power.
the hundred capable GALAXters I chose.
But we'll update the world without relying on that power.
No matter what!
You're going to take that thing along to school?
It's fine.
We're the only ones who can see it.
Well, sure, but...
That was close!
I wonder if something's happening.
Either way, he shouldn't have driven so fast on this road!
But he may have been driving a sick person.
Oh, maybe his wife went into sudden labor?
Why do you bother thinking about things like that?
When you think about it that way, don't you feel like they had a valid reason?
Don't you feel less angry?
Well, sure...
It's more fun this way.
So, The current of the flowing river does not cease
might be a phrase even you guys have heard.
Kamono Choumei was a court poet in his younger years...
Milk?
There has been a worrisome leak.
Last night, there was a power outage at a factory in Tokorozawa,
and milk was left at room temperature for several hours.
Class is finished!
According to the source,
even though disposal was recommended,
the supervisor would not allow it.
Instead, the batch was shipped out after undergoing
a simple disinfection procedure.
Is that bad?
Yes.
There were factors indicating a potential emergency situation,
so I illegally obtained data on the batch's management
and component analysis, and ran an analysis.
So you did some cracking?
Well, I guess it couldn't be helped.
So, are they guilty?
Thanks for the food!
Yep, looking good.
Yummy!
Milk?
Wait a minute.
Thanks for the food.
It's from X.
The milk's not safe!
Huh? What?
What's wrong with it?
It's urgent, Senpai!
C'mon! Help us out!
We got to the kiosk lady okay.
Next, a school-wide announcement and then hit the vending machines.
Yeah! Split up and unplug them!
Wait a minute.
Did you get permission from the teachers?
There's no time for that!
Have you heard about the milk?
Please tell the others!
I feel dreamy...
Seriously?
It's an anti-tampering device.
Oh, no announcement yet?
They won't let us in.
The broadcast room is only accessible from the teachers' lounge.
So, we need to tell everyone!
Isn't it a ruse?
We can't just take stuff from the internet at face value.
But there are lots of people who've been helped by GALAX.
Yeah, X tells us everything, too.
You'd better not be using it to cheat.
Oh, c'mon! That's not why we're here!
Um...
I'm using GALAX, too,
and I think it can be trusted...
Maybe we can, at least, urge caution...
Anyway, we should consult the principal.
Consult?
That'll be too late.
Where's the key to the vending machines?
That's also in the teachers' lounge.
They say we need permission...
I'll send a decoy. Let's use this opportunity.
Oh, it's kind of like a game.
A decoy?
You, of course, Senpai.
Use your sword and mess around.
Huh, what?!
You can use an umbrella or whatever, too.
Get the attention of people who are getting
in the way at the teachers' lounge and in front of the broadcast room.
That's impossible!
Besides, what about my reputation at school?
Senpai, you're a Gatchaman, right?
N-Not so loud!
The school's in a crisis.
But that's no excuse to skulk around and go out of control!
Heroes should face problems head-on.
Listen, Senpai.
It's like that car earlier this morning.
That car wasn't out of control for no reason.
Well, you don't know if there really was a reason.
That's just your speculation.
But now, we definitely have a reason.
You're a hero, right, Senpai?
We have to protect everyone!
Where's the key?
O-Over there.
The key to the vending machines is probably there, too.
Don't drink the milk!
Okay!
Next!
Are you still using the key?
They're in front of the inner courtyard now.
Oh, they're done.
This one's the last of them!
What now? Should we go get it?
Oh, Senpai!
Can you slash right here?
Slash?
Slash!
Fine!
Here goes!
I slashed it!
Congratulations!
The world has been updated.
Mission complete.
Yay, updated!
Nationwide, 68 percent of schools
and 74 of businesses averted any casualties.
Flaw in Quality Control at Dairy Company
Victims who made purchases from individual stores
and wholesale distributors number in the double digits.
That's more than I thought.
Is that an indication of just how many
people still don't trust information from GALAX?
It is true that people of a certain age range
or in certain professions exhibit markedly lower confidence.
However, many who acknowledged the information
were still unable to take appropriate action.
Oh, I see.
They're afraid of being held responsible in the aftermath,
so they cannot easily take action based on outside information.
It's what people call the adverse effects of a vertical society.
That's probably what we're actually up against.
Running GALAX has made my enemies clearer than ever to me.
They're the ones who refuse to see people as individuals.
The ones who cannot see the joy
in helping others if there is no reward or reputation to be gained.
Either way,
anyone who's not... fun, I guess?
Oh, that was great, Senpai.
You looked kind of cute being scolded by the teachers.
Is that your attempt to make me feel better?
Oh, you wanted me to do that?
What are you doing?
But, well...
This kind of... the internet's got a lot going for it, maybe.
You think so?
Its influence is huge.
That's not true.
Huh?
If your battery runs out, or if you don't have a signal, that's it.
You can't just blindly follow the internet.
Okay, then.
Hey, stop it, Al-chan.
Stop. It tickles.
It's dinner time!
Come help.
Okay.
Wait a second, okay?
Oh?
Oh...
Is that from Hajime-chan?
She just pushed it on me.
That girl's way too fun!
Why don't you become friends?
Here.
All right, beans are on the menu today.
I'm dreamy...
Can you circle around and get closer?
I want the setting sun in the background.
Multiple rescue requests have appeared on the timeline.
A news channel helicopter has crashed into a ropeway's support pillar.
The pillars bent, stranding the two gondolas on either side.
You brought that to school?
Isn't Toyosaki, the gym teacher, annoying?
That doesn't mean you should
Well, it's not like I'm going to do anything to him with it.
What?
Now!
You!
Stop resisting!
Don't move!
What?
Where is he? Where'd he go?
Look around!
Hey, there he is!
N-No!
Stop resisting!
It wasn't me!
L-Let go of me!
Let go!
Gatcha...
Who are you?
Was that your doing?
Yummy...
Go...
Number 58 of the Hundred is on the dispatched rescue team.
They are in operation,
but due to numerous obstacles that cannot be overcome,
he is requesting usage permission.
There are several GALAXters among
the passengers exchanging information,
but the situation seems pretty dire.
I see...
If we don't use it now, when else?
The rescue team alone would just end in a fail game.
I simulated all possible avenues for a successful rescue
given the current available human resources,
but all results were negative.
I guess we'll have to use... the Crowds.
Ready!
Play the Game...
