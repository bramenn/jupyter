I went over to Toru's place for the first time yesterday.
OOOh! So how'd it go with him?!
We didn't do anything like that, jeez.
But he's got like, a massive TV mounted to the wall,
and loads of spare rooms on the second and third floors of his house...
I thought he was a poor plebian like me!
S-Sorry to hear that...
What's up?
Shut it, you rich asshole!
-Wow, what the hell?
-You wanna order a cake? -Wow, what the hell?
Yeah, I forgot to pre-order one this year.
We should be able to handle it.
We don't take that many pre-orders, so we're not swamped or anything.
What kind of cake do you want?
Ooh, can I get one with tons of whipped cream?
Okay.
I invited Yuna-chan over for Christmas!
So we'll have you, Yuna-chan, Miyamura...
Wait, is he gonna be able to come?
You'd better invite him over.
Hell, I don't care if you can't make it, but Miyamura better be here.
Sounds like you might be sleeping in a manger on Christmas.
Christmas?
I'll probably be really busy helping out at the shop from the 23rd on.
Y-Yeah, I figured.
Sorry. But if I get time, I'll definitely come over!
It's okay, you don't have to squeeze in time for me.
Once we eat dinner, we're basically done anyway.
Sorry.
What?! You're not coming for Christmas, Miyamura-kun?!
No, sorry. I already have lots of work waiting for me at home today.
You're not coming for Christmas?! Please come! Please!
S-Sorry, Sota...
Please!
I'm so sorry!
Bro!
Miyamura-kun!
Please, bro!
You know he's dating me, right?
Miyamura-kun!
Bro!
Horimiya
You know how up until recently, I had a crush on Hori?
How recently?
I thought he gave up on her ages ago.
And you know how there was the whole thing with Kono-san?
Why does he think we know this?
I have no idea what that whole thing even was.
And Yoshikawa and I are definitely more than just friends,
but I'm not gonna start dating her or anything.
-What?
-What? -What?
What?
-What?
-What? -What?
-What?
What?
I thought they were already dating.
See, I thought that's how you'd react!
I thought you thought I thought they were already dating!
Stop thinking, you're gonna give Iura-kun an aneurism!
You thought... we thought...
Look, we're not dating!
Well, okay, but... don't you have a crush on her?
Hell yeah, I like her!
How are you not embarrassed to admit that out loud?
I mean, do you guys think this is weird?
I don't think it's weird, I'm just surprised.
But, like, shouldn't you be more concerned about what she thinks of you,
rather than what we think of you?
If you two are happy with your current relationship, then that's fine.
It's not my place to say whether it's right or not.
Wait, what?
You're so cool, Sengoku-san!
Advice sure sounds different when it's coming from a master romancer.
When was I ever a master romancer?!
Hey, there you are, Toru!
Hitherto, and Forevermore
Can I come by your place to play video games today?
Hitherto, and Forevermore
I wanna finish the game we started before.
Hitherto, and Forevermore
You do? Yeah, sure, you can come over.
You do? Yeah, sure, you can come over.
Wait, no, not today.
Oh, why? You have plans already?
No, I don't have plans.
It's something else...
No, it's fine. You can come over.
Really? It's fine if today's not a good day!
No, it's fine. It was gonna happen sooner or later...
Sheesh, I never get used to how huge your house is.
I'm home.
Why are you being so quiet?
C'mon, Yoshikawa, let's get upstairs. C'mon, c'mon!
Huh?
C'mon, c'mooon!
Ugh, why is this hallway so long?!
Oh, maybe his mom or dad are home...
And he doesn't want me to meet them?
Sorry to rush you, Yoshikawa.
No, it's my fault. I wish I were a hot guy.
What? Wait, why?! What are you talking about?
I mean, if I were, you wouldn't...
W-Wait, why are you locking the door?
Huh? I mean...
Wh-Why are you loosening your tie?!
Huh?!
I mean, I always take my tie off when I get home.
Yoshikawa-
There.
Huh?
I'm not gonna try anything weird with you,
but I don't want you to be uncomfortable in here.
I have no idea what I did wrong.
I-It's not your fault!
I'm not uncomfortable or scared or anything.
Oh, uh, is that right?
Yeah.
Oh.
Toru-kun?
Oh, no, I forgot!
-Huh?
-That's weird. Why are you closing the door on me? -Huh?
-That's weird. Why are you closing the door on me?
Do you have a friend over?
Hey! Yeah, I do! Don't barge in!
Wait, is that your mom? Is she your mom?!
Oh, then let me get you two some drinks!
No thanks! We're good! Thank you!
She's blocking it with her foot.
Come now, don't be rude to your guest!
I can leave if I shouldn't be here, Toru!
No, you're good! Stay right there, Yoshikawa!
Okay!
So her name's Yoshikawa-san, then?
Do you like cake?
Y-Yes, ma'am.
Let me go get you some.
I told you, we're good!
-But she's our guest!
-Wh-Who is she? -But she's our guest!
-And holy crap, she's tall! -But she's our guest!
Yashiro: 176 cm Ishikawa: 174 cm
-And holy crap, she's tall! -But she's our guest!
Yashiro: 176 cm Ishikawa: 174 cm
-And holy crap, she's tall!
-And holy crap, she's tall!
I'll go get that for you.
Fine.
And don't barge in without knocking.
Weren't you gonna go get us some cake?!
Okay, okay. You're so impatient.
Is that your mom?
Thank God she's not. That's Yashiro-san. She helps out around the house.
She always bombards me with questions about you.
-Really?
-Like, Who were you walking with the other day? -Really?
-Like, Who were you walking with the other day?
Who's that girl you're always inviting over?
She's such a weirdo.
Who, me?
I told you to knock!
Oh, c'mon.
Which would you like, shortcake or cheesecake?
Short... no, cheesecake.
Toru-kun, try anything funny, and I'll tell your mother.
I'm not gonna try anything now that I know you're here, Yashiro-san!
Holler if you need anything!
Yeah, yeah.
S-Sorry.
She's all excited'cause I brought a girl over.
She's nice, I swear.
Oh, okay.
I'm not gonna try anything now that I know you're here, Yashiro-san!
Spin spin spin
I'm not gonna try anything now that I know you're here, Yashiro-san!
Spin spin spin
S-So if she wasn't here, he would have t-t-t-t-
Spin spin spin
Yoshikawa?
Yoshikawa?
Wait, what?! Something's setting you off again!
What's up?
N-Nothing's up!
What?! Don't just stare at me!
Rub rub rub
You're here to play video games, right?
Yeah!
I'm gonna beat it today!
Get it plugged in, Toru!
I'm happy with the way things are.
The cakes from this bakery are great! Please, dig in!

Whoa!
What the hell, dude?
Sorry.
H-Hey...
You're coming over on Christmas, right?
Huh?
-On Christmas.

-Huh? -You're coming over.
-Sen-
-Huh? -Sen-
Can't you come over to my place?
I wanna hang in my room.
N-No, thanks...
Wow, Sengoku!
You made her cry!
You okay, Remi-chan?
That must've been shocking to hear.
Get'im, Miyamura! Knock some damn sense into him!
You got it!
Still traumatized
You got it!
You got it!
Hold on, let's hear why he doesn't want to go.
You guys have no idea!
If you knew what it was like, you'd understand!
I don't even wanna talk about it, but here goes!
Come on in.
INSECTS GALORE!
-The mantis! The mantis is gonna stare at me!
-Th-They're not mine! They're my Dad's! I'll take them down! -The mantis! The mantis is gonna stare at me!
The... mantis?
You had your end-of-semester assembly today, right? Did you get your grades?
Kyoko Hori Semester Report Card
Oh, wow, look! She's got A's in everything except Art and P.E.!
Kyoko's a smarty-pants like her dad.
Well, I really hate to agree with you,
but yes, I suppose she does take after you in math.
Why the weird preface?
This is such an emotional moment!
-Why?
-Hey, Yuri-chan, I asked you a question. -Why?
-Hey, Yuri-chan, I asked you a question.
The next time you get your grades, you'll be graduating!
-You failed tons of tests at the start of your senior year.
-Oh, right. -You failed tons of tests at the start of your senior year.
-Starting this April, I won't be in high school anymore. -You failed tons of tests at the start of your senior year.
-Starting this April, I won't be in high school anymore. -Your memory for petty details is one thing I really dislike about you.
Look at mine, sis!
Wow, great job!
I wonder what I'll be doing around this time next year.
After I graduate... what will my life be like?
Hey, sis, are you looking? Look at my grades!
-Wait, you just said we were both good at math! Are you even listening?
-Are you listening to me? -Wait, you just said we were both good at math! Are you even listening?
Shut up!
Thank you very much!
That's a huge Christmas tree...
Watch where you're going, or you'll trip and fall.
Oh, you're Yoshikawa-san's older sister!
You're not wearing your glasses today.
I actually just got contacts.
Oh, nice. I should think about getting contacts.
Would you like me to buy you some?
What? Why?
Today is Christmas after all.
It's a little weird for a high-school kid to buy a college student contacts.
You're wearing a suit today.
Yeah, I'm interviewing for jobs. It sucks.
Meanwhile, my dumbass sister spends all her time screwing around.
You can laugh. It's funny because it's true.
Go on, laugh. She's dumber than a bag of rocks.
Oh, no, I meant...
Let's take a look...
Want me to go buy some dessert?
I'm good.
Get out of the way, dude! How am I supposed to watch TV?!
The hell kind of tone is that?! I don't care if you're my brother, you're dead!
And put your gross tissues in the trash can, you dumbass!
I did! Kiko keeps taking them out!
Yeah, right!
Dammit, now it's over!
Keep your germs away from me!
High School Exam Kanji
Middle School Math Review
Yo, Moto, time for dinner.
Oh, okay.
Wow, look at all this food!
Sengoku-kun!
Come now, the bugs aren't that bad.
You're meeting Remi at seven, right? It's 6:30 now.
You spending Christmas by yourself, Sakura?
I do that every year! I'm Buddhist!
Guess I'll go.
Come on!
SLUMP
How am I supposed to eat dinner after coming face-to-face with those bugs?!
How am I supposed to eat dinner after coming face-to-face with those bugs?!
You're not eating dinner with the bugs. You're eating dinner with Remi.
Maybe I'll repeat a year and stay back.
Hurry up and graduate already, Koichi.
Really wish I could.
Wait for me. Just one year.
Just a year, mmkay?
I told you guys,
Miyamura's busy!
So? It's your job to bring'im over here anyways.
And what, ruin their Christmas sales?
Oh, he's gonna come drop off our cake, though.
Whoa, really?!
Do you think he'll come in?
I dunno, he'll probably stay at the front door.
Aww, that's too bad.
I-I'm not sad about it, if you're worried!
We're all sad about it.
Miyamura belongs to everyone.
Um, Kyoko?
Oh, thanks.

Yay, Miyamura-kun's here!
Hello.
Let's play cards, bro!
Yeah!
Sorry, I can't stay at all.
Damn, your hands are freezing! Get in here and warm up!
I'll get you a warm drink!
O-Okay, but I have to leave right after I drink it.
Yay! Let's play Old Maid!
This is a whole lot different from last year.

Aww!
Don't aww him!
Sorry.
I'll walk him home.
No following!
You don't have to. It's so cold out.
I'm coming!
It's not that cold.
It's so quiet with all the snow.
Hori-san's gone quiet, too.
We're graduating soon, huh.
Soon? We've got a while, don't we?
You know, I...
I still don't know that much about you, Miyamura.
There's tons I don't know.
Hori-san, I...
I don't know very much about you.
But I...
I want to be with you,
e-even after we graduate!
I-I mean, if that's okay.
P-Please say something.
Okay.
Let's get married!
Oh, God.
Okay, bye!
I'll make you happy!
What?!
I said, I'll make you happy, Miyamura!
Isn't the guy supposed to say that to the girl?!
It doesn't make sense that way!
I'm self-centered, and all I'm good at is studying and chores!
Crunch crunch

Wait, what?!
Wait, what?!
So you can't be the one saying it!
I don't think that's how it works, but okay.
I look forward to our future together.
Uh, yeah, same here.

Right! Right! I'm coming-
Sorry, I gotta head back to the shop!
Oh, sure, good luck!
I'm freezing! I better get home, too!
My face is all hot.
Next Time: I Would Gift You the Sky
Do you go to the shrine on New Year's every year?
I try to. How about you?
Only when it gets less crowded.
Wanna go together this year?
Shake shake
Fortune
What's yours say?
Keep calm and carry on, basically.
You sure that's it?
I mean, as long as you keep smiling, I don't need much more.
What was that? I couldn't hear you.
Nothing.
Really?
I didn't say anything.
I'm happy as long as you're smiling, too.
So you did hear.
Hear what?
Amazake
It's kind of weird, you know?
You're the last person I see this year,
and the first person I see next year.
Yeah.
I hope it'll be like that every year from now on.
Hey, Miyamura?
Will we be together forever?
Yup, together forever.
Forever.
