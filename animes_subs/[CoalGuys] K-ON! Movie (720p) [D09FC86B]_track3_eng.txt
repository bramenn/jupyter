It's morning?!
I'm off to the club room.
See you!
Bye-bye!
Sky high!
This feels wrong.
This isn't the music that Afterschool Teatime is supposed to play!
But... this is the path I want to take.
What?!
Screw you, Yui! Screw you, Yui! Screw you, Yui!
Please! Stop it!
Umm... Did something happen?
The light music club might get disbanded...
Disbanded? Why would you do that now?
We all want the club to head different ways.
It's the difference between our musicianship, Azu-nyan!
Musicianship? Oh, please!
How could you talk about musicianship when you forget three chords to learn a new one?
Says the girl who fell and flashed her panties on stage.
That's got nothing to do with this!
Wait, weren't we talking about musicianship?
What do you think, Azusa-chan?
Oh! Well...
I think the songs we play are supposed to be happy and cheerful!
To be frank...
Maintaining this cute and fluffy image has gotten...
quite tiresome!
I don't want to hear that from you!
You joined and was all like,
The light music club plays light music, right?
And now you want us to play Iron Maiden?!
Maiden?
You said that anything's fine as long as we take it easy!
Let's play old maid?
TL Note: Old maid is a Japanese card game
Don't be stupid, Azusa!
This is a matter of the club's life and death!
Azu-nyan.
Yes?
Let's play later.
You joined but you can't play guitar! You don't even play harmonica!
Mhmph! I can play harmonica!
Really? Then try playing it.
Sorry, I can't.
This is ridiculous!
Huh? Mugi?
Mugi?
Ultimately, it's your fault for bringing sweets!
You ate the most.
It's because they're yummy!
I am so sorry about that.
What?! Mio-chan, say something!
It's Ritsu's fault.
That's right! It's Ricchan!
What did you just say?!
Isn't this the song from just then...
What exactly are you guys doing?
Oops, our cover's blown?
We were copying Death Devil!
It was fun!
Could you guys stop acting during practice?
But Mio-chan, you were all for it!
You were just acting?
Yup.
I wanted to try playing out this whole difference-in-musicianship thing!
Every band goes through it, after all.
I had a feeling it's something like that.
But now that you're here...
Wait a moment, please!
Shall we have some tea?
Should we hold a meeting for what happened earlier?
I was hoping we could scare Azu-nyan a bit more.
So the meeting's not for the practice.
I fed Ton-chan!
Thank you.
None of us did particularly well.
Yeah, that ridiculous wasn't the best either.
Don't worry about it!
You're not supposed to say that to yourself.
I can't believe I joined a club that's so random.
Don't you dare go cheeky on us!
See the tea in your hands?
You're only able to enjoy it because you joined!
My family is extremely proud of that tea.
I'm sorry. It's delicious.
Wow, Mugi, is that baumkuchen?
Let's eat it layer by layer.
Don't! That just sounds wrong!
Hurry up and open it, Mugi!
But I'm trying...
For three years, we've been eating sweets, having tea,
and practicing here together.
Now, only graduation's left.
That's true, but are you fine with having senioritis?
Well, we already got into university.
Right, Ricchan?
Now that's what I call a miracle.
I'm not surprised by Mio-senpai and Mugi-senpai, but...
Wait, what did she just say?
Mio-senpai, I have scissors here.
Yui-senpai...
It's cute, isn't it?
It opened!
Now then!
I'm so happy we all got into the same university.
Therefore, cheers!
Azu-nyan, you too.
Okay...
Cheers!
Cheers!
Sawa-chan?
You have no idea how relieved I was when I found out you all passed.
It must be tough to be the teacher of a graduating class.
But time goes by so quickly.
I can hardly believe you girls are already graduating.
I wonder how much tea we've had in these three years.
Easily a thousand cups.
A thousand!
We are truly Afterschool Teatime!
We lived up to our name.
Anyway, only goodbyes are left to be said.
Unless you want to stay for an extra year.
An extra year?
Yeah.
We're having a meeting next week.
We'll be checking if you've attended classes like you should,
and whether or not you're failing your tests.
That's such an important meeting!
S-S-Sawa-chan, we were pretending to be Death Devil just earlier!
The Death Devil is the best band!
Yeah, Sawa-chan's band is the best!
So!
So?
A-A-As a light music club alumnus, could you please...
Spear us?!
That sounded funny.
Aren't you a bit late about that?
Please!
Great Master Yamanaka Sawako!
What's up?
Are you thinking about what Sawa-chan said?
Nope, it's just...
This definitely belongs to her.
I was thinking that we're about to graduate without displaying the dignity of a senior.
That's not true at all! We're...
Tall!
Older!
Healthy!
Is that it?
I want to do something a graduating senior would do.
That sounds good!
Let's do that! Nice idea, Yui!
And what should we do?
How about a present?
Something that feels like Azu-nyan.
There they are.
I'm so excited!
We must keep it a secret!
Senpai!
Azu-nyan...?
You dropped trash all over the place!
I was afraid of getting lost on the way back to the club room...
I picked them up.
Now I can't return to the club room!
Don't be so childish.
Let's go.
Something to make Azusa-chan happy?
It doesn't have to be a physical object...
Well, let's see...
Did she mention anything to you?
You're classmates, after all.
Perhaps like, the seniors are so cool!
Well...
Don't hold back!
Well, she said she'd like you to take practicing a bit more seriously...
And that you should clean up the club room at least once in a while...
And that you're hugging her a bit too much...
Onee-chan!
Nothing too surprising there.
It's so nice of her to have stayed in the club all this time.
But you know...
Azusa-chan always talks about the light music club.
Really?
Really!
Not to mention she joined the club because she saw you guys perform.
Right, she did say that.
How about staying an extra year to graduate with her?
Huh?
Onee-chan, I was kidding!
Azu-nyan...
What would you like?
Yui-chan!
Good morning, Mugi-chan!
I see that Gitah gave you a hickey.
We slept together!
So cold!
Mugi-chan, let me hold your hand!
Ritsu! Ritsu!
What?
I've written some new lyrics before going to bed last night.
Oh? A new song?
She's just like ice-cream.
Let's get Mugi to write the music for it!
Ricchan! Mio-chan!
Hey!
Morning!
Mugi-chan's hand was so warm that I started sweating!
Akiyama-san's hand was so cold that I got a frostbite!
What are you talking about?
Have you thought of a present for Azu-nyan?
What about you?
I tried, but I fell asleep.
Me too. I also left my socks on.
I always take them off when I sleep.
What?!
Mio-chan, you're so naughty.
I was talking about my socks!
Morning! You're so early.
I only get to see you all on a school day, after all.
That sounds good.
Nodoka-chan, morning!
Hey, morning!
Let's book it tomorrow.
Then let's go buy swimsuits after that.
This will be my first time in Hawaii!
Did you hear that, Mugi-chan? Hawaii!
Yeah.
Hey, you guys are going to Hawaii?
Yeah, for our graduation trip.
What about the light music club? Are you guys going anywhere?
Well... Ricchan!
Whacchawan?
So, about guidebooks...
The volleyball team's going on a graduation trip.
We should go on one too!
When are you going?
A week before the graduation ceremony.
Tickets are cheaper then.
Hear that, Ricchan?
Before spring break, huh...
I think we should as well...
But no!
We're not them! We should do our own thing.
More importantly, we should think of something for Azusa.
May I have your attention please?
We were thinking our class should do something for Miss Sawako on the day of graduation.
Anyone have any ideas?
Oh, and please keep it a secret from her.
What should we do?
Something like a tearjerker?
How about we all sing the school anthem?
What does Miss Sawako like?
Well...
So I think we should go on a graduation trip.
Here we go.
I thought about it carefully and not to mention we've already gotten our passports together!
Shouldn't we first think about Azusa's present?
Yeah, we'll think about it eventually...
No!
You're always such a procrastinator.
But just for a little! Meanie!
I interviewed Ui about it!
Let us hear the results of that.
Yeah, Ui said...
Wait a moment, what's that?
It's from the Scrolls of Frolicking Animals!
I saw it the other day in the textbook
So what did Ui say?
Ui said that it would be nice if we stayed for another year
and graduated together with Azy-nyan.
So the present would be to stay back a year?
Yeah, staying back a year!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Something's definitely the matter.
Really?
And didn't you just mention staying back a year?
We have our circumstances as well.
How long have you been outside listening, Azusa-chan?
I wasn't listening! I just heard...
You misheard it...
You definitely misheard it...
What are you doing?
We were talking about where we should go for our graduation trip!
There's a city in the Federal Republic of Germany called Luenen...
TL Note: Luenen is pronounced the same as staying back
What?!
Who would give a city such an ominous name?!
We can't go there!
Oh, graduation trip.
Dubai!
I thought you wanted to go to Hawaii.
Dubai!
Europe!
A hot spring! I wanna play table tennis!
What about you, Mio?
Me?
I guess... London?
It's the hometown of many great musicians.
And it has a long history of music.
You all want something different.
What about you, Azu-nyan?
I'm not graduating yet, so I don't know...
Wait, when did we even decide we're going on a graduation trip?
We just went with the flow.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Don't you want to go, Mio-chan?
Of course I want to go...
Who here doesn't want to go on a graduation trip?
Silence...
Ton-chan.
Then it's decided!
What an amazing way to make a decision.
Then let's decide with a ghostleg lottery!
I may not seem like it, but I'm very good at ghostleg lotteries!
How can you even be good at that?
It's done!
Now, I'd like to invite our club president, Tainaka Ritsu-san, to start us off!
Huh? Me?
This one, then!
Roger!
Let's see where we're going then!
Europe it is!
That's great, Yui!
But where in Europe are we going?
Ask Yui about that.
Yui-senpai!
Yes?
May I see that paper for a second?
W-W-Why would you want that?
I'm just curious.
Um...
She's trying to escape!
She fell!
Yui!
Yui-chan!
Yui...
Yui?
Yui!
Ricchan...
Yui!
I've finally managed to bend my fingers like this!
You did it! You did it, Yui!
Ricchan...
I thought so. She rigged it.
What?!
Darn it!
I saw through what you were doing.
You little cheat.
Wow, that's amazing, Yui-chan!
We're not praising you.
I made a little mistake.
Keep it on. It's your punishment.
Yui.
Come on, let's decide for real now.
We all want to go to different places...
How about we vote for it?
That won't work.
How about letting Ton-chan decide?
Persistent.
Which teacup is Ton-chan gonna choose?
It's like we're at a theme park! This is so cute!
By the way...
What?
Why do I get the feeling that the Europe cup is a bit smaller than the others?
That's to punish the cheater.
I see...
Why does Ton-chan have to take on such a large responsibility?
Ton-chan is so floaty today.
He's not interested in the teacups at all.
The weather's nice...
They've given up already!
Look! T-T-Ton-chan is near Europe!
But he's touching London!
So we're going to London?
Yeah.
London is in Europe, so it's all good.
Really? How far is Europe Europe?
I feel bad for the university you got into.
Mio! It's London!
I'm so glad for you, Mio-chan.
Hurray!
Mio?
Mio-chan?
Hurray! London! Hurray!
We get it, so calm down already.
Lo-Lo-Lo-London!
You really wanted to go to London, didn't you?
We can have afternoon tea there!
We can have tea in London?
It's the country of black tea.
That's cool! It's the perfect place for us!
If we have five, we'll take two rooms.
Three and two?
Yeah.
Azusa-chan, you're coming too, right?
Of course not! It's your graduation trip, after all.
Have you lost your passport?
No, I haven't, but I have to go to school...
There's a break after the finals, right?
Yeah, I think it's five days...
There we go! It works out!
But...
We should all go together.
Without you, the light music club won't be complete.
Azusa, you don't want to come?
I do! But...
Won't I just be in the way?
Why?
Then sure...
Hurray!
That's decided!
But first things first, I must ask my parents.
Mom? It's Azusa.
Umm, well...
Thanks, Mom!
My mom said it's okay, so...
Yeah, London!
It'll be our graduation trip...
Oh, mama?
Mom, I'm begging you!
Yeah, Ritsu's coming too, so it'll be okay.
Really?!
Thanks! Bye!
I'll have to stay levelheaded.
Huh? You mean London London?
Of course, Nodoka-chan! Are there any other Londons?
You just texted me so suddenly. I thought it was a new shop or something...
We're all going tomorrow to a travel agency to book our tickets.
I didn't know you girls in the light music club wanted to go to England so badly.
You look weird in that.
You see, Mio-chan was the one who wanted to go,
and Ton-chan made the decision.
The turtle decided it?
Soft-shelled turtle!
And we're not going to England. We're going to London.
Yui... You know, it's hard for me to point this out...
London is in England.
It's such a sudden decision! I didn't think I'd be going too.
You're buying a lot of these books...
I need to look up stuff because no one else will.
Please take care of my sister.
That reminds me, Ui...
It's about your sister.
Hmm?
It feels like she's keeping a secret from me.
Do you know anything about it?
I don't think she could keep secrets at all.
That's true.
Y-Yes!
We'd like to go to London for about five days.
So three nights and five days in London?
Three? It doesn't add up!
It takes a night to get there and come back.
Oh!
I knew that!
Sure.
Would you just like to visit London City?
Sounds good?
I guess.
I think it's okay!
There's plenty to see there.
I wanna ride this!
Let's go to a cafe and have tea.
This looks delicious.
This looks delicious.
This is cool.
I just want to visit the homes of Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page!
That sounds good!
David Bowie's house too!
Look, there's an instrument shop.
Abbey Road!
Excuse me... In that case I'd suggest you take a personal trip
as you can go wherever you'd like.
No, that's a bit...
Okay, let's do that then!
Good morning!
Oh, girl from the light music club.
It's cold, isn't it?
You're still doing your occult activities?
Yeah, we're going to try sending a message to outer space from the roof.
Oh right, the light music club's going on a trip to England!
That's nice.
It's our graduation trip!
What would you like me to bring back for you?
Nessie's...
Nessie...
Please take a picture of Nessie.
Sure, okay!
Leave it to me!
Girl from the light music club...
So can we fit that in our plans somewhere?
Nessie?
Loch Ness is really far away.
And Nessie probably doesn't even exist.
Wait, was that a joke from the occult club?!
It flew right over my head!
Don't worry, Hirasawa-san.
Oh...
So do you guys have any other requests?
All good!
Then I'll try to plan our itenary so that it all fits together efficiently.
Are you sure you don't need help?
Yeah, I love planning things.
Sorry.
Azusa-chan, would you like some more?
Thank you, but I'm already full.
If Azu-nyan's planning our schedule, then we won't have any snack time...
If we can go wherever we like, then we should go wherever we like.
Azusa, you're going home?
Yes. Are you all staying?
We're going home!
After practicing afternoon tea, that is!
We're...
going home after one more cup of tea, Azusa-chan!
Here, a souvenir!
It's nothing impressive, though.
We're gonna wash the cups too!
Okay... Thank you very much.
Be careful, Azusa.
And be sure to fit in snack times!
I'll be going now.
See you tomorrow!
Now then...
Time for the main act.
Of what?
You're still here?!
Hey!
Come on, Sawa-chan!
Don't worry about it.
Oh right, weren't you having a date today?
I don't have such plans!
Oh? See you later!
Okay.
So what should we get for Azu-nyan?
She's always taking care of us.
If we were to express our constant gratitude to her...
How about a play?
No more plays!
What would be nice?
Azu-nyan left Muttan here!
This is terrible!
It's Mustang.
Yours is named Elizabeth, right?
Well, how about asking Muttan?
Muttan, what would be a good present for Azu-nyan?
Just kidding...
Muttan!
Wait!
Muttan spoke.
A track, he said.
Shoot! Was it that bad of a fall?
A train track?
No, a track!
A trick?
No, a track!
Field?
No! A song! You know, music!
Why didn't I think of this earlier?
You mean we should write a song for Azusa?
Yeah.
Ui said that Azu-nyan loves the club and the music we play.
A song for Azusa-chan?
That sounds great!
Right? A song for our little Azusa!
It's such a cool idea!
Yeah, it's cool!
Wait, Yui, what kind of a song should it be?
It's a song from us to her, so it should be like bang, stomp, and boom!
I don't get it.
It should be a song of a much greater scale compared to anything we've written before!
So give us an example?
I forgot it...
Good morning! Just kidding...
Azu-nyan! How long have you been there?!
I just arrived...
Really?
Yes!
That was close.
Oh, right! You forgot Muttan!
You shouldn't forget him!
Right...
I'm sorry about that.
Bye-bye!
Nothing weird.
Azu-nyan?
What am I doing? I'm sorry!
It's nothing! Bye!
I've never seen them so serious before.
Fishy...
It's from Mugi.
She's enjoying it.
I'm more worried about it...
This song will turn into a worldwide hit!
Onee-chan, could you hold it down here?
It won't fit in!
So much Japanese food...
I'm sure you'll want to eat them.
You're taking your school uniform as well?
We all are!
I see.
Yui, you should take this English traveler's dictionary with you.
Thanks!
Also take this plug converter and transformer.
Thanks!
Now you've gotten even more luggage...
You should sleep early. You too, Ui.
Yes!
We'll be in London tomorrow this time!
That's great!
I'd feel safer if you came with me.
But you won't fit.
Just kidding.
Onee-chan!
I'm off!
Take care, Onee-chan!
I'll grab something to drink.
Sure.
Watch my luggage.
Okay!
Ricchan! Ricchan! Morning!
Morning! Gitah...
I was thinking Gitah and I should take some photos together...
Mio's not the only one.
What?
Even Azusa?
Good morning!
Morning!
You brought Mustang.
Yes... I was wondering if I should, but I was sure Yui-senpai would bring hers...
And I was right.
Yui and Azusa are here.
I thought so...
If we run into some musician, we totally have to ask them for an autograph!
Of course.
Let's go to Mugi's station then.
Oh look, we're not the only ones.
Do you have everything with you?
I forgot my passport!
Then we'll be in London without you.
You're wearing it on your neck.
I thought it was some charm...
Mugi-chan, good morning!
Good morni
That's not fair! I should've brought mine too!
It's huge...
Wow...
Should we have some tea?
Wow!
Let's check our baggage first.
Good idea!
I'm sorry,
but today's flight is extremely full.
If possible, would you please check those as well?
We shall meet again in London, Gitah!
This is cool! I wouldn't mind having one in school.
A walking corridor!
You mean moving.
I can see your legs!
Please tell us about your rumored relationship!
Are you going out?
How is he?
Kotobuki-san!
Let's do the moonwalks!
Stop fooling around.
Look!
Wow!
Ritsu! Ritsu!
Should we get some snacks?
We'll be getting food on the plane.
You're so well-informed, Azusa-chan.
I looked it up.
I can't believe this!
We get on a plane,
and when we get off, we'll be in London!
A different country.
I'm so excited to go abroad with you all!
We might end up in the past or even in the future!
This isn't a time machine.
But we're getting time back.
Mugi-senpai!
Here, your eye masks.
Thank you.
Thanks!
Hey, Mugi, how do you use this?
How are we getting time back?
I think it's because we're flying in the opposite direction of the Earth's rotation.
So we get time back if we turn the opposite way?
I guess.
Then...
We should fasten our seatbelts.
So if we kept turning the opposite direction, we'd really end up in the past?
We can't go that far back.
Then how far
Look, we're taking off!
Oh, a takeoff!
Azu-nyan! We're mooving!
Clouds!
Azu-nyan, we can't speak Japanese from now on.
Okay?
I understand.
Azu-cat.
Huh?
No Japanese.
Jeez...
Azu-cat, what's the English word for food you get on the plane?
Flight meal.
Chicken? Or beef?
Exercise!
Chicken please.
Excellent!
And me? Me?
Cheers!
Chicken? Or beef?
Beef please.
Excellent.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Would you like the Japanese meal or the western meal?
Azu-nyan! Azu-nyan!
Right! Lyrics for Azu-nyan.
What's this? Worldwide?
Azu-nyan, did you see anything?
Oh, not at all.
I see.
Was there something written on there?
Yeah, it's about how I want to live from now on...
I should think about this stuff seriously.
Yeah...
What was that about?
Don't tell me that she's really thinking of changing
Afternoon Teatime's musical direction now...
Or maybe she really has to repeat a year, so that's why she's thinking of such things?
Her, as great with desserts...
Azu-nyan, wake up!
We're here!
England? Is this really England?
The flight was quicker than I thought.
We're part of the international population now!
We flew in the sky!
Please calm down!
We're really here.
Custom's next, right?
What's that?
Oh, right.
They usually just ask about the purpose of the visit.
The purpose?
Yes. So you should just tell them sightseeing.
Okay!
Side business!
Side business?
Hello!
Yes!
Four days?
Yes. I am seventeen.
I'm finally reunited with my Gitah!
Now I feel safe!
But if we think about it carefully, why did we bring them again?
Mio, has your baggage arrived yet?
Not yet.
It's still not here?
It'll be here soon.
It's not here.
Why is it just me?
Is it lost?
Akiyama-san, what are you gonna do now? Your panties are in there!
You're a lady, after all!
But Mio doesn't wear any, right?
Yes! She is no panties!
That only applies to socks and when I'm sleeping!
Look, it's over there!
You're right.
Someone must've put it aside.
We couldn't see the forest for the trees.
It's okay now.
It's freezing!
This is the cold of London!
The sky of London!
A taxi of London!
The English of London!
And us in London!
Hey.
Taxi! Taxi!
Good afternoon.
Hello.
You see,
my dad told me that in London you open the taxi doors for yourself!
There's no handle.
So it's automatic.
Ricchan, you should ask
That's it! It's this way.
Here, put your luggage up there in front.
Thanks.
Where are you going?
Where... Hotel Ibis please!
Yes, the Ibis. Which one?
I think he's asking where it is.
Where? In London, of course!
A London joke!
London City?
Yes!
We're sitting backwards!
It feels so weird.
Senpai, are you all right?
Sorry, Yui! It's my fault for closing the door so suddenly.
I'm fine, I'm fine...
I'm lucky Mugi's so soft.
I'm glad.
It caught me off guard.
That's my line.
This is abroad for you.
Lon-Lon-Londo-don!
Thank you!
I'm not used to sitting backwards...
Yui-chan, are you okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine...
Just let me sit down a little...
Are you okay?
What should we have for dinner?
Dinner!
I'd love roast beef!
And ice cream!
Oh, no!
What's wrong?
We don't have a reservation with the hotel!
So we can't stay here?
Are we sleeping on the streets tonight?
What should we do?
May I see that?
Yes!
You reserved the Ibis Earl's Court.
Earl's Court?
Yes. This is the Ibis London City.
We have many locations throughout London.
Mugi-senpai, what did she say?
Too fast.
I think...
they have multiple locations around the city.
I see!
And I think our reservation is in the one at Earl's Court.
That's good!
Okay! Thank you!
Earl's Court... Let's see...
Ah, it's here!
We're right here.
It's quite far away. Are we taking a taxi again?
Can we see Yui flying around again?
I wanna try sitting on the other side!
Hey, can't we go by bus?
Sounds good!
Do you understand it, Mio-senpai?
There doesn't seem to be a direct line.
Too bad...
But if we take the Underground, we can go there directly!
What's wrong, Azu-nyan?
I came in my new shoes...
Does it hurt?
A bit...
Do you have blisters?
Has it hurt all this time?
No, it just started hurting...
Then let's go buy new shoes for you.
Huh? We can't do that.
You're all tired and we have lots of luggage...
Then I wanna go here.
What's that?
Here! It seems like they sell rocker clothing here.
Sounds good, Azusa?
Azy-nyan mooving!
So cool!
I must take a picture together with Gitah!
Uh...
Yui-chan, let me azu-sist you with that!
How is it, Azu-nyan?
It looks fine.
Yeah, it's fine.
That's good.
It looks good on you, Azu-nyan!
What?!
Sushi!
It's conveyor belt sushi.
It goes around?
Yeah.
Mugi, you've never been to one?
Then let's go!
But we're in London.
No, it's because we're in London.
Let's see how good you are,
London!
What's this?
What...
It's so fancy.
It's going around!
It's going around... I've got a bad feeling about this.
Does it remind of what happened at the airport?
But it's different from what I imagined.
I thought the sushi here will look like ballet dancers!
Huh, there's a stage...
Hello.
You're the ones from Japan, right?
He said from... and he said Japan...
Yes.
I'm the manager of this establishment.
You're the ones who will be performing today, correct?
Um... Yes! So tall!
Yes!
Don't just say yes to everything!
But he's welcoming us...
This way, please!
Yes!
Wow! So you wear happi in London sushi bars!
Just like how you wear aprons in grill bars?
Okay! If you'd like to get on stage...
Gitah!
What's going on?
What?!
Mugi-chan?
Mugi!
Excuse me!
Mugi-chan went to tell them that we're only here to have sushi, right?
We really need Mugi here after a
No!
What are you doing, Mugi?
But it wasn't there!
Leave this to me!
Hey, you!
I am buchou!
We are okyakusan!
No ensou!
I'm glad you're trying, Ricchan, but that isn't really English!
Give it one more try!
London is amazing.
Ricchan, he's still looking at us.
We can't get away from this...
I guess we should just get it over with.
Yeah! Otherwise he might not let us eat sushi!
Do we really need to do this just to eat sushi?
What should we do?
Yui, what should we play?
Um... Um...
How about Curry Before Rice?
But we're in a sushi bar!
It's related to food...
And he looks like a nice person.
Let's do it!
What are you talking about?
Don't leave us behind.
Sorry! Sorry! I just got all hyped up!
Anyway, we should hurry up!
Azu-nyan, I think the sound's off by a quarter.
But we don't have time to tune it.
I'll just match yours.
One-two, one-two-three-four!
We're Afterschool Teatime!
Thank you!
Arigatou gozaimashita!
Wonderful!
That's a nice one.
Rice!
Thank you! Thank you!
Well, can we move on to sushi now?
Thank you, Love Crisis!
What did he say in the end?
He said Love Crisis, didn't he?
I think I've heard that somewhere before.
That's Ricchan's friend's band!
Yeah.
Then your friend's Love Crisis Japan, I guess.
I knew it! This whole rotating business is sketchy.
And you know...
I'm really hungry!
Don't mention it.
She said it.
I want...
To eat sushi...
But I'm not brave enough to go in there again.
I wonder if the customers there all preformed before they get to eat?
Anyway, we're blocking the way, so let's move.
Yeah...
But still, what's wrong with this sushi bar?
Oh look, Ricchan! Mio-chan!
Yes?
I'm so surprised! Are you traveling or what?
Yes! Sightseeing!
You're all here!
Yes!
I'm so good at English.
But they're talking in Japanese...
Huh, Maki-chan?!
Love Crisis Japan!
What? How? Why? Why are you here?!
I don't get it!
What's wrong?
We wanted to eat sushi but then they made us perform.
After we performed, we couldn't eat sushi... We must've played badly...
Really? We're supposed to throw a gig here to celebrate the shop's opening.
They mistook us for Love Crisis!
Whoa, Mugi-chan! You're a real detective!
Do you remember Kawakami-san?
From the live house?
Yeah. He introduced us. He knows the boss of this place.
The world is absolutely tiny.
It feels so weird.
Oh, we're sorry!
They still have the wrong idea.
Oh, right... We'll be going in then.
Okay, see you!
See you!
Bye-bye!
So cool...
Yeah...
We finally got to check in!
It's finally just the two of us, Azu-nyan.
Yeah, it's been a long trip.
I'm so hungry...
I wanna take a bath too...
You're right. It was quite cold.
What should we have for dinner?
Ah!
And so this is it.
Thank you, Ui!
We'll have to thank her when we get back home.
But we can't eat this without a microwave.
What have you guys been doing in the room?
We've been taking pictures!
In your school uniform?
That's why we brought it with us!
What are you so happy about?
But I see you're wearing yours too, Mio-senpai.
I feel so refreshed.
Ui's made such great preparations.
She's my great Ui after all!
What's wrong?
It was spitting fire!
Scary!
Yui, you should use the transformer.
I'm too scared now...
Let's just eat.
Azu-nyan, I'm staying back a year!
We're in the same grade now!
But...
We'll take care of each other.
Then what should I call you, Yui-senpai?
Just call me Yui.
Yui?
Yeah.
Yu... i?
Louder!
Hey, Yui! Stop that!
Just like that.
It just doesn't feel right.
I'm not in the year above you anymore... anymore... anymore...
What's this?
Yui-senpai... Creepy!
Good night.
That was a close call!
Since we're already here, I'd like to see a few things.
You used it in the play at the school festival.
Oh, Ricchan's tombstone!
Yeah!
Hey!
The occult club did a good job replicating it.
It's devotion.
This is a replica as well.
We've walked so much!
Let's take a break.
There should be a place around here where we can have afternoon tea.
Afternoon tea? Azu-nyan, that's the essence of our existence!
We needed a reservation.
It's huge...
It's rotating...
It's rotating...
Let's ride it!
Right, Mugi-chan?
Right, Mio-chan?
I'll watch over our stuff down here.
See you! Go and have fun!
Mio...
Mio-chan...
Come on! Come on!
No! It's rotating! I don't wanna!
Don't worry! We're all here with you!
Pull yourself together, Mio-chan.
I don't wanna go round and round!
Amazing! We can see all of London from here!
Look, Azusa!
Mio-chan's having fun.
You can't see that the ferris wheel is going around when you're in it.
Amazing!
Let's take pictures!
Mio, I'll azu-sist you with that.
Ricchan, look at that.
Mugi, can you azu-sist me with this?
Okay!
She said it!
Bye.
See you.
I'm going over...
But this is your room.
I'm home!
I'm sorry! Are you okay?
But I'm...
I'm not into that sort of thing!
What do you mean?
I was just trying to hug Gitah...
I'm sorry! I messed up!
I'm sorry!
Don't worry about it... I'm lucky I got that book on self-defense from Ui...
A-Azu-nyan, are you going to sleep?
Want me to sing you a lullaby?
Sleep... baby... sleep...
I'm sorry.
We're not here to look at pictures together!
Do any of you have an idea of what type of song we should write for Azusa-chan?
Not at all.
I thought London would give me enough inspiration for a large scale song...
Big Ben! London Eye! River Thames!
You're just saying the names of famous places.
But I wanna do something that feels greater than anything we've done!
So that even after we're gone,
she'll feel motivated whenever she listens to it!
So that she'll feel invincible!
Invincible, huh?
What?
Well, I forgot to bring the room key with me.
But you can go over through there.
This time it's really to mark the path back?
I'm going back to Azu-nyan then!
You've dropped your candy!
It's okay! You can have them!
Good night, Yui-chan.
Good night.
She's so random.
It's this late. Who could it be?
So high up...
It's Azusa! Azusa!
Hey! Come in!
Thank you.
Azusa-chan!
What's up?
Sorry for disturbing you.
Ricchan, this is bad!
It's really bad!
Calm down, Yui!
Azu-nyan's missing!
She just came over.
But she went back already.
What?
Ritsu-senpai, something's weird!
She's awake.
Yui-senpai is missing!
Ricchan, this is bad! Really bad!
This is really bad, Azu-nyan!
Azu-nyan's missing!
There you are.
Yeah...
Where have you been?! I was worried sick!
Well, I...
A call?
Who could it be?
Maybe it's the reception?
This late?
Maybe it's from Japan?
But it's 6am in Japan!
Yui-chan, you got the hang of the time difference.
Hello?
Yes! Oh, yes!
What? Murder?
Just kidding!
They hung up the moment I answered.
Ouch!
I almost bit my tongue... Careful, careful...
Who could it be?
If it was important, I'm sure they'll call again.
That's right.
An invincible song...
Then what should I call you, Yui-senpai?
Azu-nyan?
She's asleep?
Senpai, you should blink every now and then.
A song for Azu-nyan...
Um...
Azy-nyan-nyan-nyan, Azy-nyan-nyan-nyan...
Don't stare at me like that! Jeez!
She got mad at me.
I can't conceptualize the song at all.
Azy-nyan-nyan-nyan... Azy-nyan-nyan-nyan...
I should get this line out of my head.
London... London...
Recycling only!
Nope!
Yui-senpai!
We're about to leave!
Azu-nyan!
This feels like London!
That's the same model as Yui-senpai's guitar!
You're right.
A song for Azu-nyan...
Something of a grander scale...
Something grand... Something grand...
Wait, that's not it!
A song for Azu-nyan...
Something cool like the streets of London...
Huh? It's from Kawakami-san.
Thanks for the other day!
You doing fine?
I wanna talk to them too.
I heard from Maki-chan that you're in London too.
That's right.
So I have this little request...
There's this event to spread Japanese pop-culture.
Love Crisis and Black Frill are gonna perform.
Would you guys like to as well?
Popcorn?
No.
It's tomorrow afternoon. Are you still gonna be there?
Yes.
I'll email you the details.
We'd be representing high school girl bands.
Hey, listen!
If someone from Japan sends you an email,
has it traveled back in time?
No, it hasn't.
But it's today here, while in Japan it's already tomorrow.
Well...
What should we do?
Yeah, this is quite sudden.
Wait, then if we send an email back, it's gonna travel to the future!
Yui-senpai, we can't decide anything if you keep blabbering, so please be quiet.
Should we refuse?
I want to perform!
You don't?
I don't really get it, but aren't we pretty lucky?
It'll be okay! I'm sure it won't end up like that night in the sushi bar.
That isn't the problem here.
I wanna do it too!
Okay, then I'm sending a reply to Kawakami-san!
Come on, Azu-nyan!
Yes!
Okay, send!
We're sending an email to the future!
Um...
We're flying home tomorrow...
Oh, that's right.
Are we gonna make it?
When was our flight again?
We should get to the airport by 5pm.
The performance starts at 4pm.
It'll be fine! Don't worry!
Is that a peace sign?
Yeah! Peace! Peace!
I worry when you tell us not to worry.
Anyway, I decided to translate Rice is a Dish to English!
Huh?
We're singing in English?
We're going international.
Can you do it?
How did you translate it?
Well...
Gohan wa sugoiyo should be Rice is super?
Isn't that a bit too literal?
What about It goes well with everything?
Bacchiri just fit!
But isn't bacchiri Japanese?
Mushiro gohan ga okazudayo?
That's... not so much A as B...
Yeah, that's what we learned in class.
Not so much a Azu-nyan...
Rice is not so much main dish as side dish?
Now rice isn't the main dish but a side dish!
But that won't do!
Shut up! Next! Next!
I felt like I had an idea.
A song for Azu-nyan.
What was it?
It felt like some great realization...
Then what should I call you, Yui-senpai?
You're sleepy, Azu-nyan?
I didn't sleep well because I had a dream about you.
Really? What kind of a dream?
A really weird one.
But I'm keeping it a secret.
Wait a moment.
What is it, Mugi-chan?
Mugi-chan!
Is that your keyboard?
You all brought your instruments with you, after all!
It's nice to have money.
I'm glad they're all here.
It still feels humongous no matter how many times I look at it!
It feels like it's going round and round no matter how many times I look at it...
Look! That must be the venue!
Which way is it?
They have yakisoba over there!
I'll bet 5000 that we can't have any this time either.
Hey, Maki-chan!
Ricchan!
Hey!
When are you going on stage?
Half past three.
Right before us.
And Black Frill?
At four?
Weren't we scheduled for four as well?
That's right...
Ricchan, is there some mistake?
No, it's correct.
Black Frill and us are performing at the indoor stage.
You guys are performing on the open stage.
Open?
So not here...
But here?
The view's amazing.
It's wonderful that we can perform here!
I was a bit worried that we're the only ones out here, but this might work out.
Hi. Ho-kago Teatime?
Yes!
Could you set up your instruments now, please?
What?
He's telling us to get ready.
Can I just plug it in?
Will there be sparks?
Why would it spark?
Right, Mio-senpai?
Right... I've got a bad feeling about this.
Even you, Mio-senpai?
Is there anyone who knows?
You mean among the audience?
Should I call a staff or something?
You should just plug the damn thing in!
Gitah!
Sawa-chan!
That guitar isn't even made in Japan.
What? An illusion?
Why are you here?
Does she have legs?
That's rude! I'm not a ghost!
What are you doing in London?
Honeymoon?
I had enough miles saved up.
I've always used my credit card to pay, even for booze, to stock up points,
but they're expiring soon!
Not to mention I'm the advisor for the light music club.
When did you get here?
I arrived last night.
And when are you going back?
Tonight.
Adults are amazing.
You should've just told us.
I tried calling your hotel but you wouldn't answer.
Oh, so that was you...
Anyway, I brought some special costumes with me.
Japanese lady ninjas!
We're not ninjas!
Wow! Bravo! Bravo!
Stop clapping...
Look at this!
Nodoka-chan!
Even Ui?!
Even Jun?!
Rejected.
Anyway, man your stations.
So we've had lots of fun in London!
Very interesting!
Did I get that right?
Yui, we should get going to catch our flight.
Next is our last song!
Rice is a Dish!
One, two, three, four!
In the end...
She's singing in Japanese.
Once more!
English now?
Senpai...
Sky high!
Are you now?
What was that sky high?!
I overdid it! That baby was so cute!
That's true, but...
That baby in the front?
We're hardly gonna make it.
I wanted to show off how cool we are!
Hey, taxi!
She's asleep.
She's been working so hard for the entire trip, planning everything and such...
I bet she's tired.
Look! Snow!
You're right!
Hey, I just realized something important.
We should just do a song like we usually do!
You just realized that?
I was thinking that too, Yui-chan.
Huh? Mugi-chan?
I've been thinking that all along.
Nodoka-chan, pick whichever one you'd like.
This should be enough for a decade.
She couldn't have afternoon tea in London, after all...
That's too bad.
Yeah.
But you gave a performance!
I heard about that! I wish I'd been there!
It was so much fun.
The people in our class also said they'd like to be there.
Really?
Hey, so you performed in London, right?
How was it?
What did you do?
We did Rice is a Dish!
Are you serious?
That's it, Ichigo!
I'd love to hear you guys perform once more before we graduate.
The Jazz Club's doing a graduation gig, right?
Yeah.
What?!
That's nice!
We didn't think about that!
We should definitely do something!
Yeah! But where?
The club room?
May I request something then?
A performance in the classroom?
Yeah! On the last day of school!
Our final piece of memory which will complete our high school days!
That brings back memories!
You can't do that! You'll disturb the other classes!
Do the choir or even the woodwind club perform in class?
Sawa-chan, what's gotten into you?
The point is that I can't make an exception...
just for you!
We get it, Sawa-chan.
Okay, I'm glad you understand.
Excuse us.
Back then, I think the teachers got extremely mad at us.
They're nowhere near as hardcore as we were back then.
They're cute and fluffy.
They wouldn't be able to endure it.
They'll end up crying...
Then I must...
protect them!
The deadline for corsages is tomorrow!
Okay!
Azusa, may I have those scissors?
Sure. Here.
Thanks!
Azusa...
What?
This is quite entertaining.
Shoot.
No, it was Yui-senpai...
Ui! Look at what Azusa's done!
What's up, Jun-chan?
Check out these scissors!
That's not it...
Hi!
Performance in the classroom?
Yeah.
But it's our classroom, so...
We should perform by ourselves...
We've been thinking about it...
That's no good.
Really?
Yeah!
This will be my last chance to perform with you all in front of everyone!
And it's taking place in school, too!
I'm so glad!
Thank you, Azu-nya
So when are we doing it, Ritsu-senpai?
The last day of school is finally here!
I'll protect the girls!
We'll need one more row.
Is that okay?
We should just wipe them afterwards.
Saved forever!
Miss Yamanaka, you're early today.
Yeah, I've got plenty to do.
Huh, what's this noise?
Maybe there's some sort of construction going on?
I see. It's some lively construction.
Yeah, right!
So this was what you were talking about!
I knew it was suspicious!
Please wait!
A gig?
Yeah!
I wanna see!
Well, this will be our last song.
This way!
It's started!
Please! Please wait!
As if I would!
I can't let you go!
What's going on?!
It's our last chance!
Well, they're so much cuter compared to what you were like back in your days.
Now,
all that's left is to finish Azu-nyan's song!
All that's left? That's the most important thing!
Oh right, I've gotten the melody down.
Let me hear it!
Mugi, this is amazing!
We just have to do the lyrics now.
Yeah.
We've spent so much time with Azu-nyan that this is difficult!
Yeah.
She's our treasure!
Let's use that!
See you!
Sis, it's dinner time.
What?
You've gotten taller.
Really?
We're done?
We're done!
I'm so glad! We made it in time!
Yui, I really hope you didn't tell Azusa...
Don't worry! I didn't tell Ui either!
You know...
What's up?
They've been acting so weird lately.
They've always been weird. Kinda.
That's not it.
How are they weird?
When I show up, they suddenly stop what they're doing.
That is weird.
When I ask about what they're doing, they just look away...
They might just be sending messages to outer space!
Doubt that!
Or they might be feasting on snacks when you're not around.
That's...
possible.
They've been hiding something for a while.
Hey, Ui...
I'm just asking to be sure, but Yui-senpai isn't staying back a year, right?
Nope, she's not.
Really?
She said she's going to buy new tights for the graduation ceremony.
I see...
Then maybe they failed to get into university?
That's definitely not true.
Then what could it be?
Don't worry about it, Azusa-chan!
But hey, we got to meet you, who's wonderful...
Something's missing here...
Onee-chan, can I come in?
Sur
Uhh...
Oh, not yet!
Come in!
Onee-chan, the strings are gonna leave marks on your face again!
You're right!
Then let's do it like this...
Are you ready for tomorrow?
Yeah...
It's time to graduate.
Sleep early!
You too.
Sure.
Ui!
What?
Thanks!
Thanks to you, I'm graduating tomorrow.
Yeah!
Good night!
Good night!
Oh right, Ui!
What?
We can all have tea together even at the university, right?
Of course! I don't think there will be a problem.
I see... That's good.
Good night for real.
Good night.
But hey, we got to meet a wonderful kitty...
Hurry up!
Wait!
Quick!
Yui!
It's open!
Hey, Ricchan...
You think we can do this well?
I've never been this nervous before.
Me too!
My hands are so cold!
Really!
I'm... nervous too.
This is bad!
Want to just call it off?
We can't!
What will Azusa-chan think?
Of course she'll be happy!
I'm glad I'm not the only one with stage fright!
Of course not!
When I first heard Ricchan and you perform,
you played Give Me Wings, right?
Then the light music club started with the four of us...
Then Azusa joined too...
Our club powered up from that!
Azusa's cutting gave us a much fuller sound.
Yui's a brute forcer, after all.
I don't want to hear that from you.
I see! So Azu-nyan gave us wings!
Azu-nyan is a cute and little angel who brought us happiness!
Angel?
That's right!
What?
But hey, we got to meet a wonderful angel.
How about that?
Wonderful!
Isn't it a bit embarrassing?
No, I think it's great!
This song might turn into feathers for Azy-nyan!
It will! I hope...
It will! We put so much into it!
It's full of our love for Azusa-chan!
I hope she's gonna like it.
Should we have some tea?
I guess.
Let's have red-and-white buns!
Those are delicious.
This is for Azu-nyan.
How should we do it?
Well, as the club president, I will first say
Azusa, there's a song we want you to listen to!
Mugi is next.
Something like it's dedicated to you, Azusa-chan!
I hope I can say it properly!
You can't burst out laughing, Mugi-chan!
Wait a moment! Whenever we talk about stuff like this...
Oh, Azusa!
I'm sorry...
I wanted to make the tea today.
Too late.
Azu-nyan, come over here!
I see...
Azu-nyan was happy, right?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Akiyama-san, could you possibly be crying?
My nose just got stuffy!
It's not the time to cry, Mio-chan!
That's right! We're college students now!
You're all so positive...
We should get some more adult-like sweets for the tea!
That's right!
Is that it?
She's back!
By the way, that Death Devil song was for their juniors too, I heard.
Really?
Everyone's sensitive in a different way.
Oh? Then we're keeping the tradition!
It's just a coincidence though.
Oh right, where are we going next year?
Next year?
For Azu-nyan's graduation trip!
We're going?
Of course!

My heart starts pounding when I look at you

My heart is racing, this may be love
I can't stop, my hungry spirit's getting dizzy
Please give me a hot plate of curry
Give me a spoonful of spicy sensation
Today I want it spicier than the usual mild
It burns, it burns, it burns
Load of curry, pile of rice
Page after page in my history textbook
the setlist from long ago just continues
Back when we were still turtles in the sea
we might've been swimming around together
I get that feeling as my heart aims, locks on and I can't look away
It feels like a puzzle ring
Forever, wherever we go
Let's sing holding hands
Hey, did we run into each other by fate?
The answer is a smile and a full power session
We met and didn't just walk away, isn't it amazing?
So even if the pitch is a bit off
it'll be okay
Together
We met before we were even born
We'll meet again after we get reborn
Let's say thanks for our good luck
and fill our hearts with the greatest love of the galaxy
Hey, this harmony is amazing, this sensation, it's fate
This is so good even Beethoven would get jealous
If we could talk about this easily, then
it'll all be okay, right?

Rice is beautiful.
It goes well with everything.
Ramen, udon, and okonomiyaki, they all work.
It's the perfect collaboration
between carbohydrates and carbohydrates.
Hot! Hot! Warm! Warm!
Rice is beautiful, it's a pain to not have any.
Why don't we call it a dish?
Okonomiyaki and rice are definitely for Kansai people!
But I'm not from Kansai. (What?)
One! Two! Three! Four! Rice!

Raindrops from a starting shower
How beautiful they are
Looks like sparkling water
that stops the town from yawning
Count three drops
then catch a big one on my forehead
The rain is talking to me
Without you, I can't do anything.
I want to eat your cooking.
So when you get back home
I'm gonna embrace you with a great big smile
Without you, I can't take it anymore
I want to hear your voice.
Just being able to see your smile
Means everything in the world to me
Simply being by my side
You've always given me the courage
I want to be with you forever
I want to deliver these feelings to you
On sunny days, or even on rainy days
You were always by my side
Whenever I close my eyes, I can see your brilliant smile
Will these feelings reach you?
I'm not so sure
But please don't laugh and listen to me
I'm going to put my feelings into this song
I thank you with all my heart
And deliver it to you with this song
I'll never forget this feeling
Dedicated to you
Hey, if you're going to write your name
on a piece of memory to store it forever,
let's write it on something we treasure.
Look at all the exciting days we spent together
that filled up all of our hearts with your memories.
I've worn these school shoes and uniform for a long time,
and I'll surely miss the pranks on the white board,
but to get through to tomorrow,
I seem to have to leave them behind at the door.
But hey, we got to meet a wonderful angel.
Graduation isn't the end.
We'll stay friends forever.
We have photos of all of us,
we share the same key-chains,
and they'll forever remain to shine,
just like your smile.
The train station, the riverside walk,
even if we're not together, let's look up at the same sky,
and sing together!
But hey, we got to meet a wonderful angel.
Graduation isn't the end.
We'll stay friends forever.
If you'll say that you love us, we'll tell you that we love you twice!
Make sure you didn't forget anything.
We'll be forever together.
