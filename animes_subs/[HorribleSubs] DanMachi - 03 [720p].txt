Yeah...
I think it was a bright, clear day, just like today.
Hey! Bell, come quick!
They said my grandfather was attacked
by a monster in the mountains and died.
They said he fell into a deep valley where we couldn't go to search for him.
I've made my decision, grandfather.
I'm going to become an adventurer.
But I looked so weak that no familia would accept me.
Get lost, kid!
We won't feed you!
You could do the cleaning, I guess.
You'd better have your own money.
Please, let me into your familia!
Come back when you get stronger.
Hello, young man.
Are you looking for a familia?
There was a goddess...
My goddess.
I'll buy you some time.
You should run away.
What are you saying, Bell-kun?
Open this door, now!
Goddess...
I don't want to lose any more family.
Bell-kun!
Bell-kun!
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Hestia Knife The Blade of a God
Some monsters escaped?
What about the guards?
They all looked like they had their souls sucked out somehow.
We think someone from the outside is responsible, but...
We can worry about that later!
How many monsters escaped?
Nine!
Our familia's strike force went into action immediately.
We can't deal with it quickly enough by ourselves.
We'll work with the other familia.
Ask the other gods here for help!
Wait!
It was we, the Ganesha Familia, who let those monsters escape!
If we have to rely on other familia for help, we'll be humiliated!
I am Ganesha, the lord of the masses!
Our greatest happiness is seeing our children smile!
Forget your desire for position and honor!
Our highest priority is the safety of the people!
We're terribly sorry!
To avoid confusion, we're going to let the festival continue.
Don't let this problem get any bigger.
Go!
Yes, sir!
What are they after?
A diversion? Confusion?
Or perhaps...
Goddess...
Okay, Hestia.
Listen carefully.
The hieroglyphs you carved into that knife gave it a status of its own.
That weapon is alive.
Alive?
When it comes into the hands of your child, Bell Cranel,
it will come alive for the first time, and it will grow as he does.
Bell-kun!
Thank you!
Is that true?
Yeah!
Somebody from the Ganesha Familia was saying that
monsters escaped at the west gate!
You're too loud!
What if you cause a panic?
I-I'm sorry.
Anyway, they said if there are any adventurers nearby,
ask them for help, no matter what familia they're from.
But the odds of any being around are...
What, you guys got a way to make some money?
Did something happen?
The Sword Princess?
Aiz Wallenstein?
I wonder if the goddess got away okay.
And Aiz-san isn't coming this time, is she?
I wanted to see her...
But maybe I'm lucky
she won't see me like this again.
Way to go!
That's our Aiz-tan!
How many monsters are left?
Aww, you don't have to be so shy!
We've asked other adventurers for help,
but there are probably three or four more...
Wait!
The Sword Princess really is amazing, isn't she?
Yeah, I can kind of see why Bell-kun admires her so much.
He's not caught up in all this, is he?
Farewell, Goddess...
Bell-kun!
No...
Why?
Why did you come back?
Goddess!
Goddess! Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
What are you doing here?
I asked you to run away!
Why?
You really are hopeless, aren't you?
There's no way I'd run and leave you behind.
You want to protect me, you say?
Then I'll say the exact same thing to you.
And you promised me, right?
Please...
Don't leave me alone.
But...
But at this rate we're both going to...
It's too early to give up, Bell-kun!
It's too early to give up, Bell-kun!
Excuse me, Goddess!
I'm sorry, Bell-kun!
Despite everything that's going on, I'm incredibly happy!
What are you talking about, Goddess?
Maybe...
He's after you, Goddess.
It's only a matter of time until he finds us.
Then let's change our plan.
Instead, Bell-kun, you'll defeat that monster!
I'll update your status right here.
Hit that monster with everything you've got!
It's impossible.
Even if I'm a little stronger,
my attacks aren't enough to kill that monster.
And...
I can't...
Bell-kun...
When did you start being so pessimistic?
I believe in you.
'Cause I mean, you know?
The Bell Cranel I know, who's in love with that
monstrous Wallenwhatsit woman,
could defeat that monster easily.
Goddess?
I can finally give you this.
What's this?
Your, no...
Our weapon!
I call it...
The Hestia Knife!
I will bring you victory.
I promise!
Please, will you believe me?
Yes!
This is probably the last of them, don't you think?
And now Ganesha owes me, too.
The silverback is still out there.
A witness saw it chasing a young adventurer down Daedalus Street.
Daedalus Street? Of all the places...
Yes.
The Ganesha Familia's strike force went after it,
but given what that place is like, they can't even find it.
Let's take a break!
Aiz-tan!
This knife has that power?
Yup.
In other words, it's the perfect weapon for a new adventurer.
Wow!
That's the Divine Smith of Heaven, Hephaestus, for you!
Your flattery won't take a single valis off your bill.
But from a blacksmith's perspective, a weapon like this is totally wrong.
Don't make me make another one, okay?
Thank you!
Thank you, Hephaestus!
The question is how much Bell-kun's status has gone up...
Wow!
His ability score total is over 600 points?
This will do it!
Goddess, it's coming!
It's okay, Bell-kun.
I'll say it again.
I'll bring you victory.
Yeah.
You'll believe in me, right?
Yeah!
Okay, go!
This is...
That is your power right now, Bell-kun!
That knife is alive!
The more its wielder...
The more you grow, the stronger it will become!
The more I grow...
Believe in...
Believe in me!
And believe in yourself!
I'll believe.
I'll believe!
I'll believe!
I'll believe!
For my goddess!
I di
You did it!
You did it!
You did it, Bell-kun!
Yeah!
I did it, Goddess!
Thank you, Goddess!
That's my line, Bell-kun!
You did it!
What? It's over already?
I chased after your butt... As fast as I could.
We're leaving already?
I told you, we should take a break!
This got really big, didn't it?
Yeah... you're right.
Goddess?
Bell-kun...
You really did good.
Goddess!
Maybe that wasn't a very nice thing to do to Hestia.
Let's play again sometime...
Bell.
A lot happened,
but you all did great!
Ganesha is extremely satisfied!
And by the way, I'm Ganesha!
We know that.
No fatalities or serious injuries.
But...
We don't know who did this or why.
What was that?
How is your goddess doing?
It looks like she's just tired and resting.
Sorry to bother you with this.
You even lent us a bed...
We have to help each other with trouble.
Mama Mia said it was okay.
So take your time.
This only happened because I forgot my wallet...
That's how you got caught up in all this.
I'm sorry.
No, it's not your fault, Syr-san.
Oh, right.
All the townspeople said
you were very heroic when you fought the monster.
Oh, no... All I did was run around.
That's not true.
Actually, I saw a little of it, too.
And I fell in love.
I'll go help in the pub.
See you later, Bell-san.
W-Was she making fun of me, maybe?
Bell-kun!
Bell-kun...
Goddess!
You scared me when you just collapsed like that!
I guess the exhaustion caught up with me.
Sorry to worry you.
I heard from Syr-san and the other waitresses
that all the monsters besides that silverback were also defeated.
Aiz Wallenstein-san was a big part of it, they say.
Oh. I see.
By the way, Goddess...
Where did you get this knife?
On the scabbard it says Hephaestus...
Is that
It was that Hephaestus, yeah!
The one and only.
I knew how you always used to have your face pressed up
against the glass of her shop.
It may not have been what you wanted, but...
This is the only one of its kind in the world.
Amazing, huh?
I didn't want to just watch.
Or you to just take care of me.
Or just to have you save me.
But the money...
Weapons from the Hephaestus Familia are really expensive.
I worked something out!
You wanted to get stronger, right?
I told you I'd help, didn't I?
At least let me do this much.
More than anyone, more than anything,
I want to help you.
Because I love you!
Goddess...
Goddess!
You can always rely on me.
Because I'm your goddess.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Hurry up.
So slow...
You're useless as a supporter.
I've got no money for somebody who just slows me down
and can't do her job.
Well, if we get surrounded by monsters,
I can at least use you as a decoy.
Useless moron.
Are you serious about this, Hephaestus?
Yes, of course!
