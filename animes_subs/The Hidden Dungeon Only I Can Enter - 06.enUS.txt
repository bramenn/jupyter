Well, she's definitely from a duke's family.
Yeah, this is beyond generous.
Indeed. We should be grateful.
We did lose all of the money we won at the harem event, after all.
In return for breaking Miss Maria's curse,
to our surprise...
We each got 100 million rels.
I'm going to use mine to fix up my clinic.
I wonder what I'm going to do with all this.
Hey, why don't you use it to open up a shop?
A shop?
Maybe you could sell monster materials.
Remember? We talked about this before.
That's a decent future, no?
I'd be happy to help.
No, it's my admin and accounting skills that Noir needs.
Can boobs do calculations?
I think not.
Grr!
Come now, you two.
Arguing is never beautiful.
Let's just compromise and say Noir and I will...
That's not a compromise!
At all!
H-Hey... I'll contact you guys later.
So for today...
I'm out!
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wha...
I received that for saving a duke's daughter.
Believe it or not, there's 100 million rels in there!
One hundred million?!
Oh, my.
That's amazing, Brother Dearest.
What are you going to do with all this money?
I'm not exactly sure yet.
Noir, I can't let you be the only breadwinner in this family.
Why not leave this money with me?
Father...
Nay! Say no more!
You're planning to go to the casino, aren't you?
Whoo! Hell yeah!
You're so bright, my son! You totally get me!
To put it lightly, he's absolute trash.
You're a mind reader!
I never want to work again!
He brings shame upon our family.
I know, right?
How about opening up a shop?
Maybe an item shop... one that handles rare materials.
I'll gather our goods.
Oh, my.
How wonderful!
Hire me!
Then let's go with that.
Father, please find a good location and do the paperwork
we'll need to submit to the government.
Leave it to me!
I'll keep a very close eye on him so that he doesn't pocket the money.
H-How little do you trust me?
And so, to collect monster materials...
I decided to conquer more of the dungeon.
Hello, Master.
Master? Are you sleeping?
M-Master?
Wait, it can't be...
I knew you were faking it. You sure love pulling pranks.
Well, that's because you never come to see me!
Er, I just came here the other day.
So what's up? Exploring the dungeon today?
Yes. I wanted to gather some treasures and materials.
And I'd like to get stronger.
Then you should Get Creative and make the Dungeon Elevator skill
so you can conquer it more efficiently.
Once you've been to a floor, you can instantly travel there next time.
Though once you use it, you won't be able to use it again for another hour.
That sounds great. I'll get right to it.

I should give it a test run...
Oh, God! I forgot to close my eyes!
Oh, you're such a klutz, Noir!
I-It's sort of strange having you laugh at me in that state.
I didn't find any noteworthy monsters on the third or fourth floors.
Then I got to the fifth...
I sense a presence over there.
Did they fight and end up killing each other?
Or...
A pitch-black lion?
I-I need to use Discerning Eye!
I'm not getting any information?!
Th-Then I'll just have to...
use Blinding Light!
And then Dungeon Elevator to get the hell outta here!
W-Wait, human. I must speak with you.
I-It talked?!
You have no reason to fear me.
I am not suspicious in the least.
Er, I'm not sure about that.
And...
Why does it have a tulip growing on its head?!
Human, having acknowledged the talent you must have to reach this floor,
I have a request.
I will take you to the sixth floor, and in return,
I would like you to search for someone.
I-I accepted his offer for a ride, but...
M-Mr. Lion, you're very strong.
My name is not Lion. I am Tigerson.
Tiger... Huh? Tiger?
My friend gave me this name.
It is my pride and joy.
I-I see...
Pleased to meet you. I'm Noir Stardia.
Noir... No need for formalities.
All right.
So who's this person you want me to find on the sixth floor?
My friend.
Long ago, I accompanied my friend here.
We made it to the fifth floor handily,
but then my friend said he'd explore the sixth on his own.
There'll be a lot of traps ahead.
Wait here. I'll use my skills to get rid of them.
I promise I'll be back.
So I've been waiting this whole time.
H-How long have you been waiting?
Around 350 years now.
Three hundred and fifty years?! Then, uh...
My friend is an elf.
Elves live long lives, some as long as 500 years.
I see. Still, you're very faithful.
You didn't consider just going to the sixth floor?
I promised my friend Vashelle that I would wait on the fifth floor.
A promise to a friend is absolute.
He's very considerate of his friend.
I left Tigerson behind and came to the sixth floor.
It's so dark.
Blinding Light is meant for blinding others.
It won't really help me look around.

Why does he have a tulip on his head?
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter.
Are you Vashelle?
That's not gonna work. I need to turn him back somehow.
Okay, I'll delete that Zombified skill.
Needed to delete
Available LP.
It's not cheap, but...
Wh-What happened?
Are you the elf named Vashelle?
Y-Yes, I am.
My name is Noir.
I actually need to talk to you.
Tigerson? Really?
Yes. As promised, he's been waiting on the fifth floor.
But...
It's been more than 300 years.
He's truly a great friend.
Yes.
I just randomly named him Tigerson, but he fell in love with the name.
Before I came to this dungeon,
he saved me, even though he didn't know me.
He tried to leave without saying a word, so I ended up asking him
if he'd like to be my friend.
The other 990,000 creatures I have encountered all pointed a weapon at me.
You're the only one who reached out to me.
I've never had a friend before.
After that, I came to this dungeon to search for a treasure to send
to my love back home.
I happened to find the password in an ancient text.
And that's how you and Tigerson got to the fifth floor.
There'll be a lot of traps ahead.
Wait here. I'll use my skills to get rid of them.
I promise I'll be back.
I can hardly call myself a friend if he's just protecting me all the time.
I totally get that.
Up until recently, Emma had to protect me all the time.
And you saw how I ended up.
How am I supposed to face him again?
Vashelle...
But I can't keep him waiting any longer.
Tigerson...
I see that you are safe, my friend.
Tigerson...
Let's give up on conquering this dungeon.
I see. If that is what you wish.
My love might still be waiting for me.
But even if I'm wrong about that, I think this is for the best.
Indeed.
But I told you before, right?
Other races aren't allowed into my homeland.
Which means...
Yes, I know. We must part ways here.
Your lifespan is limited...
And yet... I wasted 350 years of your time...
It's all right.
You want to return home to your beloved.
No one can stop matters of the heart.
I'm so sorry... Truly.
Do not worry about that. I waited because I wanted to.
Tigerson...
The days I spent waiting for you had meaning.
I ended up using Dungeon Elevator to return to the first floor,
and then left the dungeon.
Tigerson and Vashelle were also heading toward the exit,
but I'm sure they had a lot to talk about.
Noir, I will repay this favor to you someday.
Don't even worry about it.
Tigerson, once things calm down, I promise to come see you again.
Stay well, my friend.
I am tough, if nothing else.
True.
Farewell, Tigerson!
Farewell.
It was so much fun.
The days I spent with you... were so much fun.
Noir, I thank you for what you have done.
What are you going to do now, Tigerson?
Who knows?
For now, I will go back to the fifth floor. I forgot something there.
Farewell.
I got curious, so I went back, too.
Tigerson?
He seemed pretty calm, but I guess he's actually angry...
He's not angry...
He's crying.
Is that you, Noir?
Yeah.
I prepared myself for the day I would have to part with him.
And yet, now that I must face that reality...
I am weak.
That's not true!
I imagined it, too. Having to say goodbye to my loved ones...
To be honest, it was so sad and painful that I didn't want to imagine it.
It felt like I was losing a part of myself.
Noir...
Let's do it.
Let's be friends!
Friends? You and me?
Yeah, I'm serious.
Actually, why don't you come live at my place?
It's much more comfortable sleeping on a warm carpet than this cold stone floor.
Aye. I shall take you up on that offer.
I can at least serve as your guard lion.
I guess that settles it.
Hop onto my back.
Let us go to your home.
No, Tigerson.
Let's go back to our home.
Ah, I see...
I finally understand, Vashelle.
There was another reason that I waited 350 years.
Today, I met another
who reached out to me. The second out of 990,000.
It's been so long since I felt the wind.
It feels wonderful. Make sure you don't get thrown off!
Okay! Let's fly!
Wh-Wha...
What?!
I'm back, Father.
I-I can quite plainly see that...
Oh, my.
Brother Dearest! Did you make that creature your familiar?
No, Tigerson is my friend.
Tigerson? Its name isn't Lionson?
Correct.
Well, whatever.
More importantly... It doesn't bite, does it?
I would never do such a thing.
It can talk?! What a smart kitty.
When we get our shop up and running, he wants to be our guard lion.
I-I see. I have a feeling he'll eat me if I say no, so...
I'll have to make an extra special dinner tonight.
Come, Tigey. Have a seat.
Tigey?!
Thank you for your hospitality.
What a magnificent mane.
Say, so what's the deal with the tulip?
Oh, that's...
My, how cute.
Th-That's
As you can see, he gets a bit weird over it.
I see. So it's just like what your mother is to me.
Well, anyway, that's how Tigerson joined the Stardia family.
Take that!
