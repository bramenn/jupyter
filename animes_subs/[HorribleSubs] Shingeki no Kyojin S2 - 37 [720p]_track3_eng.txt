Eren.
You're a man!
Show some restraint! You need to be there for Mikasa, too!
Stop!
Scream
Damn that Reiner!
He's tossing Titans like a madman!
This is all your fault!
It's you who screwed up my entire plan, you damn commander!
Ymir!
Conny, that way!
I know!
Commander!
I can always be replaced.
More importantly, find Eren and retreat!
Time is of the essence!
Eren!
Hannes!
What are the odds of this?!
Check it out, you two!
You just watch.
I'm about to avenge your mother and butcher the shit out of this!
Hannes!
Give the old man backup!
Huh?!
Reiner? What's he doing?!
Does he not care if Eren is eaten?!
Don't get in our way, you big sack of shit!
Ymir!
Dammit... What am I supposed to do?
If I can't count on Reiner, should I cooperate with the Scouts and try to survive?
But what happens after that?
Even if I can somehow live through all this...
Now's my only chance to hand Historia over to their side!
I won't be able to protect her alone, no matter how hard I try.
Christa!
Conny, that's wrong.
My name is Historia.
Hey, Ymir...
Why was it you were trying to take me away?
You said it was to save yourself, but was that a lie?
No... it has to be.
Why? Why did you do it?
For me?
To protect me again?
It's a Titan!
Ymir...
You're the one who said it, so listen to yourself!
Stop living for other people!
From now on, let's live for nobody but ourselves!
It's strange, really...
When I'm with you, no matter how screwed up it gets...
Shit!
Don't, Mikasa! You're injured!
Untie my hands!
Hands?
Hurry up!
I've gotta be the one to do it!
Who said I was done with you?!
That one's... mine!
Eren!
Wait! We're trying to get you out of here!
It's time to settle the score!
Just watch!
Huh?!
Commander!
The Armored one is-
It's coming!
Jean!
Jean!
Are you okay?!
Hold it together!
Shit!
Shit!
What's wrong?!
Eren!
Commander!
Right now...
Eren...
Nothing changed!
You haven't changed one bit, dammit!
You're still as useless as you ever were!
Nothing changed!
Mom...
I still... can't do anything at all.
Eren...
That's not true.
Eren...
Listen...
You've always... been at my side.
Thank you.
You showed me... how to live with purpose.
Thank you.
And you...
You wrapped this scarf around me.
Thank you.
I'll wrap that around you...
as many times as you want.
Now and forever... As much as you want!
Why... are they...?
They're eating it?
Dunno what's going on, but now's our chance!
Let's hurry and run!
Right!
So that's how it is...
That's why Reiner was so desperate for Eren.
Which means, even inside the walls...
This is the worst...
Why did the Coordinate have to fall into
the hands of the worst person imaginable?
We've gotta get it back...
I can say... without a doubt...
Get away from me!
You bastards! I'll kill you all!
Not good! Bertholdt!
I can't protect Bertholdt like this!
What? The Titans?
Eren!
Get on!
Armin!
Hurry!
Don't let this chance escape!
Full retreat!
Ymir!
Hey, ugly! What are you doing?! We're heading back!
I sorry...
Huh?
Ymir! Where are you going?!
Leave her!
But Ymir is-
In that moment, I couldn't understand the motivation behind Ymir's actions...
Information Available for Public Disclosure Unyielding Vow
Through extensive research and accounts of various incidents, it has become clear that the scourge of Titans which have long plagued humanity are of human origin.
The Colossal Titan which destroyed the wall at Shiganshina District is a human possessing the ability to transform into a Titan, demonstrated by its intent to breach the wall with the purpose to exterminate humans.
Titans are not sent by the heavens to punish us for our sins, but invaders that must be driven back. Thus, we swear, by the blood our brothers and comrades have spilled waging war against this foe, we shall not relent our lands nor yield the fight.
Ymir...
Why did you come to us?
Oh, well...
It's because I'm an idiot.
I'll be your souvenir to take back home.
You can't just go back empty-handed.
Ymir...
If you hadn't come to bust up this wall...
All I'm doing...
Because I'm probably the only one that understands the situation you're in.
Thank you, Ymir.
I'm sorry...
No...
It wasn't so bad, you know... being a goddess for a while.
With reports declaring the possibility that Wall Rose has been breached,
the citizens of Wall Rose were forced to take
refuge in an underground city within Wall Sina.
However, with more than half the
population surviving off food stockpiled for emergency,
rations would last at most for a week.
Any longer than that, and people would turn on each other,
stealing and killing to survive.
To stop this from happening, within one week from the initial outset,
authorities declared that Wall Rose was secure.
Trost District
It's Hange.
Come in.
Pardon the interruption, Erwin.
I'm glad we came while you're here, Commander Pyxis.
Good timing. This is...
A Scout from the 104th. Conny Springer.
Conny comes from Ragako Village.
The village the recent Titan invasion originated from?
Yes.
Actually, I confirmed with him the findings of our investigation on the village.
This only brings further credibility to that hypothesis.
He's come to report.
I was taken away...
And because of that, the Scouts lost more than half their veteran soldiers.
Just to rescue me...
Still, there were no casualties on our way back.
The Titans completely ignored us and ran off to chase Reiner and the others.
About that, Jean and I sat down to try and figure it out.
We have an idea what made the Titans act that way.
It was you.
Of course, that's just our theory.
But without assuming that, there's just no explaining what happened.
It's a tough spot to be in, Eren.
Whether or not all those people died for nothing...
If you're worth the price they paid, you better show it.
We don't have time to waste.
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
I've gotta do this.
I'll control the Titans.
I'll plug up Wall Maria.
I'll capture Reiner and make him pay.
That's what I've gotta do to atone for all those lives lost.
Say again?
The Titans responsible for this incident... were the citizens of Ragako?
In other words, the true identity of Titans...
We don't... have proof yet.
So... you're telling me...
running around killing people?
Is that right?
I said we don't have proof yet.
Erwin.
Hey. Tell me.
The hell you smiling for?
It's nothing.
It's just...
Just one step, huh?
We'll run out of people before we learn the truth.
It's not worth the cost.
But it is a step towards the truth.
One day, we'll break it down.
This wall hiding the truth...
Not yet, eh?
