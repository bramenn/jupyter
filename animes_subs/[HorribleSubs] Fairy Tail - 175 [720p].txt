On the fourth day of the Grand Magic Games,
in one of the battle part's tag matches,
a showdown between four Dragon Slayers is happening.
It's Natsu and Gajeel vs. Sting and Rogue.
The battle against the Twin Dragons of Sabertooth,
a battle that puts Fairy Tail's bond and pride on the line, has begun at last!
Clam it, already!
Wha...?! Hey! You bastard!
Wh-What is this?!
I can take both of you on by myself.
Go ahead, attack me at the same time!
Oh, boy! Now Natsu Dragneel of Fairy Tail
is challenging the two of them to a battle!
You're fired up, ain'tcha?
Natsu vs. the Twin Dragons!
Go, Natsu!
What happened to Gajeel?!
Gray-sama! You're wonderful!
Although Natsu is the one who's fighting...
Rogue...
Sting-kun! The fight's just getting started!
This is...
Him?!
It feels like Zeref,
but it's different somehow.
He's in the stadium again, isn't he?
Jellal! Don't let him get away this time!
I know! I'm concerned about the match, but right now...
You can take us on by yourself?
You're just messin' with us...
I have no business with you.
Let me fight Gajeel.
You want Gajeel, you gotta go through me.
Dragon Force is the power of a dragon.
There's nothing more powerful in this world!
Maybe your power's half-baked...
Natsu...
I wonder what's happening with the match...
Natsu and Gajeel are winnin', of course!
They're Men!
I understand if you're worried,
but it's your job to rest up
and regain your strength and magic.
But...
Knowing Natsu-san, I'm sure he'll be fine, right?
Gajeel, too...
They're so tough, they should have a plaque with that word hanging on a wall, right?
That's right!
Now you're talking!
That's Carla for you! You're a Man!
No, I'm a girl!
These people...
My power is complete!
This is the power I used to kill Vicelogia!
I see. Then I'll use my power...
Look out, Natsu!
Behind you!
Roar of the Shadow Dragon!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
That was nothing!
Frosch...
I can still fight!
Bring it on.
Yeesh. That guy...
Look at that gleeful mug...
Those two definitely aren't weak,
but Natsu responds to stronger opponents by becoming more powerful than he already is.
His opponents are tough, too. They don't give up.
Very impressive.
Both sides are quite something.
Marvelous...
I'd forgotten.
That guy's a blockhead, but when it comes to fighting, his mind is a steel trap.
Wonderful parfum, Natsu-kun...
Damn, how strong is that guy?
H-He's strong...
That's Natsu!
But where did Gajeel go?!
I'm scared of what'll happen when he comes back...
Hey, is this for real?!
I have no memory of seeing the power of the Dragon Force losing ground like this.
Power, eh?
Sting-kun!
Please let me be your disciple!
I saw your fight before! I wanna get strong, too!
Aren't you scared of me?
I'm not scared!
I wanna get strong!
A cat disciple?
Well, whatever. Follow me.
Sting-kun...
Sting!
Yeah!
This feeling... The quality of the magic has changed again.
The magic of those two has begun to merge.
In the end, I wasn't able to get strong,
but I love watching strong Sting-kun!
Unison Raid!
Their will, breathing, and magic
have combined perfectly into one power.
But...
Natsu! Dodge!
Rogue, hang in there!
Sting-kun...
Sting-kun, you're the strongest!
There are walls that power alone can't break through...
Natsu!
Yajima-san, what the heck is that?!
Unison Raid. It's so-called Uniting Magic.
It's high level magic that in general can't be mastered
even if you devote your whole life to it.
This is the power of the Twin Dragons...
However...
Holy Shadow Dragon Fang Flash!
He's not moving! He intends to take it?!
Natsu!
Happy, is something wrong?
You here to see him off?
I'm gonna head out.
Not especially...
Really? Then I'll see ya later!
I'm not gonna say anything!
I'm not gonna say anything!
Yeah.
I got it...
It's Fiore's strongest guild, Sabertooth, vs.
the strongest guild seven years ago, Fairy Tail!
And taking the challenge of this tag battle are four dragons!
Although one of them has gone off somewhere...
Currently, below the arena,
Natsu and the Twin Dragons are locked in fierce battle!
It's become quiet...
No... I feel a strange pressure.
You too?
Yeah.
Maybe this is...
Yo. How do you feel?
I'm okay. Is your match next?
Yeah.
And I'll win it for sure.
Natsu...
I believe in you.
I have ever since I joined the guild.
Thanks. Leave this to me!
What are you talking about, pressure? That's pathetic!
You're just insensitive!
What are you two doing, a husband-and-wife comedy routine?!
We ain't married!
No matter how far away he is,
he'll always be watching over me...
Look at this.
You're surrounded by such good children...
There are walls that can't be broken through power alone.
But if there is a power that can break through those walls,
it's...
Holy Shadow Dragon Fang Flash!
Secret Dragon Slayer Art!
Crimson Lotus Exploding Flame Edge!
Oh, my! It looks like the mega-moves of both sides ended the match...
It's like an earthquake here!
Apparently, the live feed lacrima is experiencing technical difficulties,
so please sit tight a little longer!
I don't feel any magic...
Meaning it's settled...?
Oh, my! Thank you for your patience!
It seems Lacrima-Vision is back up!
Natsu Dragneel...
Your power is... immeasurable...
Lector...
He's too strong...
Natsu-san...
Th-This is...
The last one standing is Natsu Dragneel!
A guild is a place that nurtures feelings.
It's Fairy Tail! He broke the Twin Dragons!
The winner is Fairy Tail!
With this, they've leaped to first place!
And this brings an end to the fourth day of the Grand Magic Games!
After one day off, we'll be back the day after tomorrow with the final battle!
The last day...
Which guild will achieve victory in the end?!
Don't anyone miss it!
I figured it would turn out like this!
That's what I expected, I guess I should say...
Our goal for the final day has changed!
Bring it!
Defeat Fairy Tail!
You're mine, Gray!
Laxus... Makarov-dono's grandchild...
Erza...
Gajeel...
Let's have some fun, Natsu-kun...
Lector...
I can't believe those two lost...
It was an interesting match.
I've thoroughly memorized it.
This'll keep us in the spotlight for a while.
For a while... If they have a while...
Th-That guy...
Saber's master!
The power of feelings, eh?
Go ahead. I'll give this match to you.
After this one, we're gonna keep winning anyway.
We're not gonna miss one or two points.
Don't cry about that one point later, kid!
Let's fight again sometime!
Total defeat...
If Gajeel has the same fighting strength as Natsu...
Just how arrogant am I?
You did it, Natsu!
I gotta hurry up and tell Lucy!
You did it, Natsu!
Yeah, well...
Today, I'll give you honest praise, Natsu.
You're incredible.
R-Really?
Don't be modest!
You gave us a good show, but what happened to Gajeel?!
Come to think of it...
He took off during the middle of it! Doesn't he know the meaning of tag battle?!
Have you forgotten what you did?!
That's Natsu!
Get plenty of rest tomorrow to prepare for the final day's survival battle.
The final battle, huh?
I'm gonna win it for sure!
Victory first!
After that, I'm gonna fight you two, Erza and Gray!
Fine with me.
I think you're putting the horse before the carriage or whatever...
Good job!
Aren't you gonna ask how it turned out?
I already said, remember?
I've believed in you since I first joined the guild.
But it ain't over.
This is just the beginning.
Our aim is winning, right?
Of course! We've made it this far.
Although we were off to a rotten start in last place on the first day...
We were even booed then.
And laughed at and we got frustrated.
But now we're one step away from victory!
Like Natsu said...
We're gonna turn it around from zero!
He said to save our tears for when we win!
That's right! Let's climb to the top!
Give up ain't in our vocabulary!
Aim for the 30 million jewel!
That's not what it's about!
Let's aim to be the number one guild in Fiore!
Yeah!
A lot's happened since I joined the guild,
but I'm so glad I did!
This is what Fairy Tail is about!
Dammit...
Salamander... You're dead...
Anyway, where the hell am I? Under the arena?
Wha...
What the hell is this?!
A dragon... graveyard?!
Jellal, what's happening?
Don't tell me he got away again?
No. I put some distance between us, and I'm on his trail.
I'm thinking I'll make my move where there aren't any other people around.
Roger.
You're not getting away this time...
You possess magic similar to Zeref's...
Who the hell are you?!
So Sabertooth's been defeated...
You must have mixed feelings, Sergeant Yukino.
No. I no longer feel any attachment to the guild.
That aside, I just can't get used to being addressed as Sergeant.
My apologies.
Participating in the Eclipse Project...
The Eclipse Project...
If my power may be of use, then I'm prepared to wield it to the utmost.
For the sake of Arcadios-sama, too, who invited me to join.
I suppose I should refer to him as Colonel.
That's all right.
I call him Captain myself.
And his old friends call him Dio.
Really?
But he's socially awkward, isn't he?
Even though he's trying to save the world,
no one is aware of it...
Is something wrong, Carla?
No...
Again, that premonition of the castle in ruins...
Lu-chan, he did it, huh?!
Levy-chan!
How are you two doing?
We brought you a present!
If we keep it up, we might actually win this thing!
Naturally! There's no way those members can lose!
Yeah, right?! After seeing today's battle...
By the way, have you seen Gajeel?
Huh? Now that you mention it...
He hasn't come back yet?
I bet he's off chowin' down on iron somewhere.
He'll be back sooner or later.
Yeah.
That day, we believed in victory.
The final day was a really hard-fought battle.
Do you remember it, Lu-chan?
And then...
We lost... to fate.
That person died...
That one, too... Even though I loved...
I can't express in words...
Lu-chan...
I can't take it anymore...
Somebody, help me!
Halt!
I'm revealing my identity. Now you reveal yours.
A woman...
It can't be...
Thank you, everyone!
Let's meet again!
