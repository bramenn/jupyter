Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
I found you, Ishida!
I won't be satisfied until I beat the hell outta you!
Right! You get it.
This is a fight between you and me!
So quit harping on about whoever kills the most Hollows!
Let's settle this between you and me!
Say something, Ishida!
Hey Ichigo!
What is it?! I'm-!
The sky is
What is that?!
Hollows are coming together.
Wait! There're so many!
You scared, Kurosaki?
Huh?
If you're scared, stay and watch.
I'm the victor of this match!
Over here, Hollows!
I, Uryu Ishida, the last Quincy, will take you on!
The last Quincy?
The Quincy became extinct 200 years ago.
No, thats not quite right. To be exact
the Quincy were destroyed by the Soul Reapers.
This was a very difficult choice for the Soul Reapers.
The Soul Reapers had to destroy the Quincy
in order to prevent the destruction of this world.
In the Soul Society,
Soul Reapers were commonly called Balancers, or regulators.
Regulators?
The sum of all the souls
in the Soul Society and the human world does not change much.
And souls can travel between the two worlds.
It is the job of Soul Reapers to regulate that.
However, one day, the Quincy appeared.
The Quincy totally destroy Hollows.
This means that any soul who left the Soul Society
for the human world would never return.
If it were left as is,
the balance between the two worlds would collapse!
And the two worlds would end.
There were many meetings between the Quincy and Soul Reapers
But the Quincy refused to heed our pleas.
And the order was given to annihilate the Quincy.
Do you think that this resulted from the arrogance of Soul Reapers?
Damn! Their numbers aren't going down.
Sensei!
Ishida!
H-He's so rash!
I heard The reason why you fight!
I don't know who was right the Quincy or Soul Reapers.
And I don't intend to tell you!
But, one thing I do know!
Your ways are
That story's old.
Huh?
I don't care about the slaughter of 200 years ago.
I only heard it from my teacher myself.
Furthermore, when I heard that story, I sort of sided with the Soul Reapers.
That is, until my Sensei died
Huh?!
I felt that the Quincy were at fault for refusing to listen at all
to the Soul Reapers.
But why?!
It was the Quincy who were annihilated.
You are right.
So many died.
And as long as there were casualties,
thinking about who was right or who was wrong is meaningless.
What we must think about is
how we can prevent this from ever happening again. That is all.
It's hard to see the sadness in the faces of humans and Soul Reapers.
He was a kind, gentle man who never hated or resented anyone!
As the last Quincy, Sensei was under strict watch by the Soul Reapers.
And yet, Sensei kept telling the Soul Reapers
to join forces and fight together.
But the answer was always the same: Do not interfere with our work.
Then...
on that day...
five huge Hollows appeared
and it was obvious that he couldn't take them on
without the help of Soul Reapers.
Soul Reapers only appeared two hours after Sensei had begun to fight.
If they had listened to Sensei,
if they had acknowledged his strengths, and his thoughts
They would have come to the rescue much sooner.
And Sensei wouldn't have had to die!
Can you understand, Ichigo Kurosaki?
I must prove to the Soul Reapers, the strength of the Quincy!
I realize that our ways of thinking are at opposite poles.
If you think my way is wrong, stay there and watch
My true strength
You talk too much!
What're you doing?!
I just don't get it!
Your teacher's hope wasn't to prove the power
of the Quincy to the Soul Reapers
It was to join forces with the Soul Reapers to fight, right?!
Well then Just when will you be able to do that, if not now?!
Opposite poles? Fine!
When you have many opponents, the best way to fight is back-to-back!
Good!
Don't get me wrong.
Unless I shot, I'd have been killed.
Thats fine!
Kill or be killed.
But it's too hard by yourself. So it can't be helped.
Isn't that enough of a reason to join forces?
I just want to destroy Hollows.
Why?
My mother
was killed by a Hollow.
Is that the reason why I want to destroy Hollows?
If you ask that, of course, it is. But
I just don't want others to go through what I did.
After my mother was killed, my dad and my sisters went through a lot.
I just don't want any more of that.
I don't wanna see that anymore.
That's how I feel.
It's hard to see the sadness in the faces
I can't say bold things like I'll protect all the people of the world
But I don't want to just protect those I can carry in my arms...
I want to protect lots and lots of people!
Your way of doing this would end up involving too many people!
No way!
But this is no time to be saying that.
We can only join together!
What do you say?!
Geez you talk too much, too.
But I understand.
Unless we survive,
we won't have a sparring partner for later.
Fine!
Kurosaki!
Huh?
The sky
Sky?
Whatis that?!
Huh?!
That's!
W-What is that?
It's huge
That bait can't have this kind of result
It's too late now!
Dammit!
H-Hello
Jinta home run!
Kurosaki, we came to help you.
Hat-and-Clogs!
We'll take care of the small fry.
So that you, Kurosaki, can concentrate on fighting that one.
Oops, you don't have time to listen to my rambling.
It's Menos
Menos?
A gigantic Hollow borne from
hundreds of Hollows mixed and folded together
But I've only seen such a thing in illustrations in school books.
Menos Grande.
I can't believe it!
That such a thing would come out
This is the jurisdiction of the Royal Special Task Force.
It's not something just one Soul Reaper can take on!
Look at the size of that thing!
No sense in thinking about how to fight such a giant.
What?
A thing like that
has to be cut and cut again, with all your strength!
There's no other way!
Let's do it, Ishida!
Hold it, Kurosaki!
Ichigo!
Stop! He's not an opponent you can take on!
Urahara! Do you intend to kill Ichigo?!
Not at all. But just watch.
This battleis necessary.
This isa Binding Spell.
For you and him.
Kurosaki!
I told you so
Dammit!
Kurosaki, can you stand?
Yeah, I'm sort of okay.
What were you thinking?!
Just how did you plan on destroying that thing like that?
Well...
I figured if I kept cutting him from the feet up,
the head would fall eventually.
This isn't Pull the Blocks Out‚Äù!
Geez!
I can't believe the way you think!
Now stand and think up a new strategy.
What is?!
It's flowing in
Is this from Kurosaki's power?
A new strategy, huh?
Kurosaki!
Huh? Aghh!
W-What's with that arrow?! How'd it get so big?!
Just listen!
We may be able to beat that thing.
Huh?!
Can you see Ishida and Ichigo, who's next to him?
Yes.
He asked that we watch from here
Does he mean watch, and then choosethe path we walk?
ActuallyActually, I haven't forgotten a single thing.
I could only doubt my own memories.
Chad
Hmm?
What are we supposed to do?
All right, now we can fight!
Hey, are you crazy?
What?!
Quit babbling!
In this situation, if you release all your spiritual energy in this form,
I'll be able to shoot an enormous arrow!
We can't waste all that spiritual energy!
Don't say waste.
Come on! Control your spiritual energy and release it all at once!
How?
What? Can't you do that?
Then how did you fight Hollows until now?
I just went with the flow.
The flow?! That's crazy!
I don't understand stuff like that!
If my spiritual energy is high, isn't it always at maximum level?
Sero? Does he intend to release Sero here?!
Run! Hurry!
If you get hit, there'll be nothing left of you!
There's no other way!
Kurosaki, grab that sword again and
Kurosaki! What're you doing?!
What?!
What is this terrible Spirit Pressure?
Kurosaki's power is increasing!
Isn't it always at maximum level?!
That's right, there's no way that can be.
No matter how high your spiritual energy,
if it's always at maximum
the energy will burn out in no time!
If he can't control his spiritual energy,
it means he always has more than enough spiritual energy.
If you turn on a faucet and a large amount of water flows out
most people will quickly turn it off.
If he's like that
If his usual spiritual energy
is always held back like that
And if through some incident, it gets turned on
It's almost time, I think.
What?!
Menos is...
I win!
What the hell is he?!
Impressive! I can see why the Boss had his eyes on him.
Yo!
What? At least say thanks.
I just saved your butt.
The least you can say is thanks.
I don't have any more strength
W-Whaa-!
What's going on?!
The shape of the Zampakuto is deteriorating!
It's because he released his energy so suddenly!
At this rate, his body won't hold up!
I must do something! I know!
This should do it
If I release the spiritual energy which Kurosaki is unable to control
W-What're you doing?!
Shut up!
Your handit's tearing apart!
Shut up!
I told you, didn't I?
If we both don't survive, I'll lose my sparring partner!
Stay alive, so that I can beat the hell outta you!
Ichigo Kurosaki!
And you can do the same to me! Ichigo Kurosaki!
Forgive me, Sensei!
I tried to look away
by hating Soul Reapers.
I didn't want to look at myself
Because I couldn't save you.
Today, I will save a Soul Reaper.
Can you forgive me?
I couldn't give my life for you
I'm a weak apprentice
Please can you forgive me?
Grandfather?
Sheesh
How am I supposed to beat a guy who looks like that?
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I dont know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move
hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
Youre not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
Hey, how are you all?
I'm Kon, the superstar of the world of Bleach!
After this comes my own new corner!
Even the Soul Society is shocked!
Mr. Kon's Soul Reaper Dictionary is about to start!
Stay tuned to this channel!
I never heard of such a thing!
It's for real this time!
