Aude Fraetor!
Arae Aryrha!
It sure feels like autumn arrived as soon as Samhain Day was over.
Now that Samhain night has passed, it suddenly feels like autumn.
Today's the start of a new semester, and I heard we're getting a new professor.
New? I bet she's no younger than a century old.
Most of the time, I can huff and puff all I want, but the Shiny Rod won't as much as make a peep.
Normally, the Shiny Rod won't listen to you even if you huff or puff.
But at really critical junctures, my feelings get through to it.
You can't usually get into it because of the strong barrier though.
Due to their abandonment of work, all of the cooking, laundry, and cleaning has been halted!
Can't we acquiesce?
This is the energy our school requires from the Sorcerer's Stone each day.
And this is the maximum daily capacity of the Sorcerer's Stone.
There is virtually no wiggle room to speak of.
There is essentially no excess to speak of.
They're cutting off the flow of magic from the Sorcerer's Stone using magic isolators!
Oh yes, Croix was scheduled to arrive today to fill a new teacher position.
Huh? She's our new teacher?!
How is it flying? There shouldn't be any available magic.
Everyone, allow me to introduce you to the new teacher of modern magic, Professor Croix.
There we will contemplate the future of magic!
It's a sign of the apocalypse.
It is most certainly not.
You are forbidden to use items such as these during lessons.
Also, I heard that you brought some sort of personal new-fangled machinery into the New Moon Tower.
I believe otherwise.
In any case!
Please do not put any more troubles on our plate, Professor Croix.
There's no hot water, so everyone's out of energy from not being able to shower.
All right, now listen very closely to me!
Okay you all, listen very closely to me!
We must somehow pacify them until Professor Ursula returns.
but ended up getting convinced by them in return.
The bourgeois could never understand the feelings of laborers!
She lives in a huge and luxurious room all by herself.
And here I had revised my opinion of you after the Samhain Festival.
Unfortunately it appears that was a mistake.
You have no idea how hard the people of the lower classes you are working!
You have no idea how hard the people under you are working!
There are other things that more urgently require your attention.
It's not like I want that to happen...
But the faeries say they can't even live without the Sorcerer's Stone.
They need it a lot more than we do, but they're holding back.
The witches use ninety percent of its energy.
Ninety percent of its energy is used by witches.
But I don't want to burden anyone just for that cause.
But I wouldn't want to burden anyone because of me.
It just wouldn't be fair to live that dream at the expense of others...
It's just not fair if someone's forced to sit and endure that...
This was made from wart of frog and eye of bat.
I call to order a negotiation with the labor union!
I ended up as their General Secretary.
We demand a ten percent increase in our alloted energy!
In addition, we request a reserve energy allowance for health and living requirements
Unfortunately, energy isn't something you can create from nothing.
The Sorcerer's Stone absorbs magic from leylines before emitting it out.
Throughout the day it continuously refines raw magic and wastefully discharges the precious resource.
That is the Sorcery Solution System!
Heleiphae Gurifa!
Looks like he's recovered.
So it truly can use magic even without a Sorcerer's Stone, can't it?
It really can use magic even without a Sorcerer's Stone.
The Words are reviving.
Noctu... Orfei!
Aude Fraetor!
Phaidoari...
Afairrynghor!
Arae Aryrha!
Akko has revived three of the long-lost Words of Arcturus.
There are seven Words of Arcturus in total.
Revive the remaining Words.
Chariot.
The time to reveal everything to Akko has come at last.

It sure feels like autumn arrived as soon as Samhain Day passed.
The new semester starts today, and I heard we're getting a new professor.
New? I bet she's at least a hundred years old.
But man, never thought I'd see Akko steal the show like that.
Gotta admit you impressed me!
Right? Wasn't she amazing?
Lemme see that magic again, Akko.
No can do.
Come on, it's not like you'll run out.
Nuh-uh. It's not so easy that I can do it whenever I want.
I'm finally starting to understand.
Most of the time, I can huff and puff all I want, but the Shiny Rod won't so much as make a peep.
But whenever push really comes to shove, my feelings get through to it.
How mysterious.
It used to be Chariot's staff, right?
Akko found it in Arcturus Forest.
For real?!
Isn't that that forbidden forest?!
It has a really strong barrier, so you normally can't enter it.
Rumors say it's hiding some huge secret.
And that legend's been going around for a long time.
Why did Chariot disappear, and how are Arcturus Forest and the Shiny Rod related?
I feel like it'll all make sense once I find Chariot.
Professor, good morning!
G-Good morning.
What did you want to talk about?
I was thinking of telling you something very important.
Listen carefully. It is your fate to
Professor Ursula!
Please come as quickly as possible!
What is all this fuss about?
It's a strike!
A strike?!
Return to your posts!
Do not think your actions will be without consequence!
My word, faeries forming a labor union is entirely unprecedented!
It's an omen.
Their work stoppage means that all of the cooking, laundry, and cleaning has been suspended!
So, what are their demands?
It appears they wish to use more energy from the Sorcerer's Stone.
Can't we accommodate their request?
We cannot!
Oh my, what a textbook downward trend.
This is the amount of energy our school draws from the Sorcerer's Stone each day.
And this is the Sorcerer's Stone's maximum energy output per diem.
There is virtually no excess to speak of.
But without the faeries doing their work, the school will be unable to function.
I've got it! Aren't some of our graduates using Sorcerer's Stones for farming and a shoe factory and such?
Why not ask them to share some energy?
If we request a little at a time, wouldn't that leave us with enough to satisfy the faeries for now?
We all have the same issue; nobody has any leftover energy.
We'll try every witch we can find!
That's hard labor!
We aged witches couldn't possibly...
Yes, perhaps we couldn't...
Huh?
I don't have the time for this...
Being young is suffering.
What?
Then Professor Ursula isn't here?
Yeah, she said she'll be back in two or three days.
We're stuck with this until she returns.
There's not much else we can do because of the strike.
What?
I used flavor magic to make it so disgusting your eyes would pop out of your head.
That's weird.
Hey! Knock it off already, Sucy!
I said to stop!
We can't use magic?
Hey! Stop what you're doing, fairies!
Whoa!
They're putting up magic isolators to cut off the flow of magic from the Sorcerer's Stone!
What? That's a thing?!
Headmistress, what shall we do?
What is even going on?!
Oh yes, Croix was scheduled to arrive today to fill the new teacher position.
Huh? She's our new teacher?!
Headmistress, it's been far too long.
You certainly came right in the middle of trouble.
What's this thing?
How is it flying? There shouldn't be any magic available to it.
This is a sorcery unit created by utilizing magitronics.
Basically, you could call it an evolved broom.
An evolved broom?
How convenient.
Everyone, allow me to introduce to you the new teacher of modern magic, Professor Croix.
Please come to my classroom if I piqued your interest.
We will contemplate the future of magic there!
Whoa! Are they going to clean up the entire sky next?!
The future... of magic?
It's getting worse.
Even the lights are out...
The strike isn't over yet.
But anyway, Professor Croix sure was cool.
I wonder what you learn in modern magic.
I heard from some of the girls who took it that they use tablets Professor Croix developed.
Wow, tablets?
This is a precursor to the impending apocalypse.
It most certainly is not.
You are forbidden to use items such as those during lessons.
Also, I heard that you placed some sort of new-fangled machinery for personal use inside the New Moon Tower.
Are you referring to my research tools?
You'll be cursed!
I believe I won't.
Be that as it may!
Please do not add to the troubles already on our plate, Professor Croix.
It's cold!
It sucks that the heating's out.
Hey, hey, what's going on?!
Since there's no hot water, not being able to shower has sapped everyone of their energy.
If we can't use magic, what'll happen to our classes?
Until the strike is over,
all lesson plans have been altered to memorizing spells!
I'll go talk to them!
They need to stop striking right away!
Lotte, be my interpreter!
Clean those ears and listen very closely to me!

We?
I'm sorry. She tried to convince them to end their strike,
but ended up getting convinced by them instead.
We demand pay!
Unity
Let us use the Sorcerer's Stone!
Unity
That is quite enough!
Unity
Unity
Unity
Unity
Unity
I ask of youwhat will you do if we lose Luna Nova?
Allowing witches to use the Sorcerer's Stone is necessary for the academy's continued existence.
Do you not all wish to continue working here?
Without your jobs, you will have no place left to live.
Are you willing to accept that?
Now, call off your strike this instant!
The bourgeoisie is blind to the concerns of the working class!

To think I had revised my opinion of you after the Samhain Festival.
Unfortunately, I seem to have been mistaken.
You're always looking down on others!
Unity
You have no idea how hard the people of the lower classes are working!
Unity
This is a waste of time.
Unity
Unity
Unity
There are other things that require your attention more urgently.
Unity
Unity
We'll never be able to use magic again at this rate.
Are you fine with that, Akko?
It's not like I want that, either...
Unity
Unity
Unity
Unity
But the faeries say they can't even live without the Sorcerer's Stone.
Right, they couldn't even move back when the dragon stole it before.
They need it a lot more than we do, but they're making do with what little they have.
We witches use ninety percent of its energy.
This is a magic school. It's only natural that witches would need to use magic.
I know, but...
You know how I want to become a witch like Chariot and use amazing magic to make people happy, right?
But I don't want to trouble anyone just for that cause.

Realistically speaking, it is impossible!
Unfortunately, energy isn't something you can create.
What if you could?

Using the Sorcery Solution System I'm developing, SSS for short,

Magic is weakening by the year!
Whatever shall we do if magic ever runs out completely?
But! If you install this SSS, you can say goodbye to such outdated worries!
The Sorcerer's Stone absorbs magic from leylines before emitting it again.
Throughout the day, it continuously refines raw magic and wastefully discharges the precious resource.
But we can convert the previously wasted energy into another form for storage, maintenance, and efficient use!
That is the Sorcery Solution System!
That sounds very complex.
Assuage your fears, for magic can be used exactly as it has been.
You'll be able to ride brooms and perform summonings as you wish.
As proof, this sorcery unit is flying by the power of an SSS.

True, it does require a research expenditure.

But if we create a research lab at Luna Nova, we'll be eligible for a government subsidy.
A subsidy?!
Therefore the net cost is zero!
Unity

Unity
Unity

Zero?!
Unity
Unity

It automatically collects energy from the Sorcerer's Stone while the witches are sleeping.

The energy is then converted into a semipermanent form.
That would allow the witches and faeries to fairly and equally use the energy.

Professor Croix, at the risk of sounding like a broken record,
Unity
please refrain from bringing modern machinery to our school.
End of discussion.
Tradition this, tradition that...
You can't blame them. It takes courage to accept the new and unfamiliar.
Professor Croix...
Oh, I forgot! Thank you for saving me when you got here.
I'm Kagari Atsuko.
Modern magic is incredible! It left me speechless!
Then, Miss Kagari?
Please call me Akko!
Come visit me during my next modern magic lesson.
Sure!
Please!
We'll keep it a secret, so let us take just one shower!
Look, we even brought your favorite thing.
Will you let us take a shower?
It's cold!
What's going on?!
Stop!
Don't!
Don't touch me!
What's happening?!
Looks like fun.
They're really angry.
Flame faerie is hurt.
Never forgive the witches.
You're kidding!
W-We understand, we'll accept your demands!
Akko, what are you planning?
We have to release the magic!
Heave, heave! Ho, ho!
Something's here.
Hear us out! The teachers accepted our conditions!
We won! The strike is over!
Please, let us use magic!
Lotte, do your thing!
What's he saying?
This faerie has no emotions.
I can't tell what he's thinking at all.
It's as if...
it's a machine.
Akko!
Activating system!
Begin emosearch!
Emotional pattern: red.
Heleiphaea Gryffa!
Wh-What is...
Breathe life once more into the injured faerie!
Fuel spirit injection!
Looks like he's in good spirits again.
Are you okay?
Any injuries?
No!
I'm glad.
This is the Sorcery Whoseawhatsit?
It really saved the day, Headmistress.
So it truly can use magic even without a Sorcerer's Stone, can it?
Don't forget about the subsidy!
Where did the faeries even get something like this?
Mail order?
In any case, the issues have been resolved.
Good work.
Preparations are complete.
The academy reconciled with the labor union on the condition of installing the Sorcery Solution System.
In addition, a research lab was created in the New Moon Tower to support it,
and the restriction on digital devices has been lifted.
Thus marks the dawn of a new era for Luna Nova.
No way, I can't believe this!
Huh? You don't like that?
Why this picture?!
That part?
Anyway, isn't Professor Croix just the coolest?
Headmistress!
I apologize for the delay!
Here they are.
Well done, Professor Ursula.
But we don't actually need those anymore.
What?!
The times are a-changing.
Well, no matter.
The fuss has died down, so now I can have a nice, long chat with Akko.
About the truth.
Akko!
It really is convenient, isn't it?
The Sorcery Whatchamacallit!
