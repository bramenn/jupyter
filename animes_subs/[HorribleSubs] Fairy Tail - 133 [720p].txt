No one wants to hear your mumbling!
Natsu!
Natsu-san!
Bastard!
How dare you do that to Natsu-san?!
Exactly as planned...
Natsu! Are you okay?!
Son of a bitch!
Wait a second!
Oh, dear...
He's so cute!
Is that what you meant?!
Hey, Natsu. You're getting kind of heavy...
It's not like I'm riding you for fun!
Hey, Max...
How about opening your shop again?
I bet you could actually sell a lot of slant-eyed munchkin goods.
I ain't goods!
At that size, you can't blame anyone for seeing you like that.
Everyone, shut up! I can't concentrate!
I found out a lot.
What?
My father followed the contents of this book.
What do you mean?
Key of the Starry Heavens is about a little girl
who's told she'll become happy if she can gather
six special keys, so she goes off to look for them.
Juvia wants to become happy, too!
But in the end, the people around her become unhappy.
What kind of ending is that?
If you keep butting in, we won't be able to understand the story at all!
Aye. Sorry.
So then?
It says, The First Key goes on a journey.
How can a key go on a journey?!
Idiot. It's just a metaphor.
What the hell is that?!
How can you be so dense?!
Where did Legion attack first?
Then...
That's right. The clock hand was brought here.
In other words, it went on a journey.
That's when all of the attacks started.
Traveling Companions!
The little girl goes on a journey to find the remaining five keys.
And she finds them in various places...
In the end, she arrives at a church and finds the sixth key there.
A church?
Don't tell me...
No.
It isn't Kardia Cathedral in this town. It's much farther away.
How do you know?
I loved this story when I was a child,
so I researched it quite a bit.
And I found out the places in Key of the Starry Heavens were modeled on real locations.
I think my father scattered the five remaining pieces of the clock,
hiding one in each place.
You didn't know about any of this?
No, not really...
Shortly before he passed away... he didn't speak much.
Anyway, if we go to the places Key of the Starry Heavens was based on,
I'm positive we'll be able to obtain the remaining parts.
I don't know why Legion is after those clock parts.
But I can't let them succeed after seeing the prophecy about chaos descending!
I'm going to look for the parts!
By yourself?!
Yeah.
The Master told me to leave it alone,
but I can't stop thinking about it.
I know how you feel...
And besides, Natsu is no good to us if he stays like this.
Happy! You've been bustin' my balls ever since you got bigger than me!
You're wrong.
I didn't get any bigger. You got tiny, Natsu.
What are we gonna do?
Legion has probably already figured out the same thing.
And if I'm right, this becomes a race against time.
When the remaining parts are all gathered,
it isn't certain what will happen.
However...
Chaos upon the world must be avoided.
Let's split up into groups.
Hey, Lily...
This is a totally different direction...
I don't know what he's thinking...
Yeah. Though he is dependable...
Are you okay?
No, I'm not okay!
This body on this slope...
It's too much for me...
Hey, Lily. Shouldn't we just head directly to our destination?
Droy is gonna die at this rate.
Droy has nothing to do with my plan.
We need one more powerful person.
That's just mean...
Who is this powerful person?
A man with a peculiar way of laughing.
Geehee is what it sounds like.
Why am I partnered up with her?
The sun's beautiful rays are like a refreshing smile...
I'm sure when Gray-sama and I raise a family, it'll be like this...
I'm so happy here...
Me too...
Juvia...
What do you want?!
I came.
Anyway... I came.
I was worried about the two of you being on your own.
What's there to worry about?!
Various things...
Well, don't follow me!
I'm worried... about this and that.
And I said worried about what?!
Why?!
Why does it have to be a boat of all things?!
So you get motion sickness even when you're tiny, huh?
Are you alright?
No, I'm not alright...
Natsu-nii, get a hold of yourself.
I don't know about this group...
Why?
After all, Natsu is doll-sized, and then there's just Lucy, Michelle, and Romeo, right?
If something happens and we have to fight, the whole thing will be on my shoulders.
I don't know...
What was Erza thinking?
I can fight, Happy!
I wouldn't if I were you. I'm the major muscle on this team.
Chaos, huh?
What does that mean here?
Might you be members of Fairy Tail?
That's right...
What a waterfall...
Water! I'm so thirsty!
Over there...
There he is!
Gajeel...
What's he doing?!
Isn't it obvious? He's training.
Gajeel!
Quiet! I'm in training.
I-I'm not scared!
So what's he doing?
That's training?
I'm trying to train myself to be calm even when hit by both a waterfall and lightning!
Now go away, you're annoying!
You should choose one or the other!
I-I'll train, too!
I-I'm not afraid at all!
Come on, Lily!
Alright!
Aren't we just here to pick him up?
Sometimes there are things you just have to overcome!
We're getting off track, Lily!
This feels good, doesn't it?
It's kind of like the story Lucy was telling us about.
How so?
The girl from Key of the Starry Heavens traveled around the world, right?
I'm thinking maybe this is what it was like...
You're so happy-go-lucky...
When that girl became happy,
all the people around her became miserable and chaos descended on the world.
Oh, that's right...
And I'm no little girl...
Everyone...
How about having a seat?
It sure feels good...
Having a picnic, I mean...
Picnic?
I've always wanted to have one.
Picnic! Picnic... Picnic...
Um, Erza...
We're getting off track...
This is the first picnic of my life!
Picnic!
If we waste time doing that, Legion will beat us to the punch!
This is all part of the plan.
Legion won't get ahead of us if we just stop to enjoy one simple picnic.
The breeze is blowing across this endless plain...
Delicious!
Erza-san...
Your sense of values is out of whack.
Completely...
Hey, hey, hey!
Who gave you permission to have a picnic?!
Permission, you say?
This is our our grassy plain!
And we don't like it when people just plop down and have a picnic here!
I think you care a little too much about picnics...
Is that... a horse?
Is there some law against having a picnic
here in this pleasant vast grassy plain?
Hey, hey, hey! These women are from Fairy Tail!
I heard they're lookin' for some treasure these days!
Hey, hey, hey! That's perfect!
How about giving that treasure to us?
Information's leaked out...
After all, we've made enemies of Legion. It's no surprise that information got out.
Hey, hey, hey! This grub is delicious!
Great timing! I was starvin'!
Good stuff!
Even though it was my first time...
This was the first picnic of my life!
Requip! Thunder Empress Armor!
That's why you're mad?!
Her switch has been flipped!
Erza-san is kind of scary...
Now you're going to pay!
A love triangle...
Juvia only has eyes for Gray-sama...
Again, why are you tagging along?!
Because there's no way someone like you would be able to find the clock part.
What was that?!
You're not suited to take on a complicated mission like this in the first place.
That hasn't changed, even after seven years.
In fact, it's possible that your mind has atrophied during that time.
What the hell are you talking about, atrophied?!
For starters, we were all sealed away. For us, no time passed, let alone seven years!
Juvia only has eyes for Gray-sama...
That's so ro-man-tic!
Not even Natsu's ever said anything like that to me!
You wanna have a go?!
You get hot under the collar so easily.
For someone who wields the power of ice, you're like a little kid that's full of crap.
Full of crap?! That's even worse!
I'll throw down with you anytime.
But right now, searching for the clock piece takes priority.
Just leave it to me.
You...
Where did you hear that information?
Everybody knows about it.
Juvia is losing patience...
I don't understand it... Why do I feel so run-down?
Man Stew...
I bet it tastes especially good at a time like this!
That's right, Nee-chan! It tastes like Man!
Mira-nee...
I don't know if cooking right here was the best choice...
Oh, really?
Man!
Actually, we're with the Archaeological Society.
Archaeological Society?
Indeed.
Actually, we've heard the rumor that Fairy Tail is seeking out certain clock components.
Where did you hear that?
Well, that doesn't matter, does it?
Information is leaking out...
Could there be a traitor within the guild?!
What do you mean?
I'm sure Legion has strict information control.
It's hard to imagine an information leak coming from them.
Which means only someone from the guild could have leaked it...
There's just no way!
It's not for me to say, since I don't know everyone very well yet...
I feel sick...
You should be more worried about other things!
In fact, you get sick too much from riding on transportation!
You were saying...?
Actually, we would like you to cease your quest to collect the pieces of clock, actually.
Why?!
You guys say actually too much!
We've heard that the components have been dispersed and hidden in ruins and churches.
And you're all set on gathering them together, aren't you?
How do you know all of that?
Actually...
Key of the Starry Heavens is extremely significant, actually.
What do you mean?
Actually, it's thought that story...
such as ancient ruins and churches.
Actually, there's a hypothesis
that the places the girl in the book looks for are modeled on real locations.
Actually, we in the Archaeological Society
wish to identify those places and protect them as part of our cultural heritage.
Searching for the pieces of the clock would do damage to the ruins, you see...
Therefore, we would like you to forget about the clock.
Yes. Forget about it.
Forget about it?
From the book, I quickly figured out about the ruins...
And that's when I was a kid...
Lucy... You're smarter than I thought.
There was no need for than I thought.
Lucy?
Isn't she going a little overboard?
And is that a horse?
Is Erza-san okay?
I wonder why she was fixated on the idea of having a picnic...
I'll never forget this grudge...
This is it.
Ruins?
According to Lucy, the piece of the clock is somewhere in these ruins.
How do we look for it?
Good question...
Don't give me good question!
Lucy-san!
Forget about the clock!
There's no way I can forget about it!
Why not?
Because of the last words my father left me before he died!
He waited for me for seven years...
My father...
I can't simply forget something as important as that!
Lucy-neesan...
Actually... Actually...
Certainly, it's a story of beautiful familial love.
Natsu!
Natsu!
Natsu-san!
Natsu-nii!
That's actually Lucy Heartfilia-san's friend, isn't it?!
We actually have to save him!
I feel sick!
Even waves make him sick?!
Heave-ho...
Return to your true form!
I changed back!
How?!
Actually, we know how to do a little magic, too!
We were moved by Lucy Heartfilia-san's story,
so we saved Natsu and returned him to his rightful form!
Hey, thanks!
Continue your journey until you're satisfied, if that's what you wish!
Thank you!
I feel sick...
That was quite a surprise, wasn't it?
Heartfilia's...
Then they'll reach their destination, no two ways about it...
Are you satisfied that we let them go, Jean-Luc?
What a curious turn of fate, Jude...
However, as it stands, the destination your daughter will reach is...
Hey...
There ain't nothin' here...
Right when I thought I was free of transportation, I gotta deal with a labyrinth!
And it's a tough one, too!
Yeah, right?
Ah, well. If it wasn't, it'd be too easy!
So you say. Just don't drag me down!
Why do you talk like I'm always holdin' you back?!
You never realized it?
Next time: Labyrinth Rhapsody!
Oh, I think I more than hold up my own!
That's what they call getting a swollen head!
Seriously?! What, my head's blowin' up like a balloon?!
