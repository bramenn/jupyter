Raise your arms and face this way.
Raise your arms and face this way
I thought they'd called in backup, but you're just two kids.
Is the Port Mafia short-staffed?
Or is that man, Randou, not very popular?
Randou?
That's the name of the man we're about to go talk to.
The person that was restraining you using his special ability.
Oh, him.
Yo, old fart.
Let's save us both some time.
First, you shoot.
Next, I'll retaliate by blowing you all the way to the next town over.
And then I'll beat the shit out of your remaining men,
and we'll call it a day.
What?
Man, you could just trick him to get some information out of him.
You're with the GSS tactical team, aren't you?
Gerhardt Security Services.
Formerly a foreign-funded private security firm,
but they had their subsidies cut off
and now they're a fully-fledged illegal organization.
That's right.
I won't go easy on you just because you're kids.
Try me, old fart.
You...
You're the Sheep, Nakahara Chuuya.
So it was true that you fell into the Port Mafia's hands.
Don't get the wrong idea, you annoying prick!
Good for you.
You're amazing.
Were you just standing there watching?
I was busy collecting information from the communicator I swiped off him.
It seems like the guy you just beat up has some backup arriving.
You just make more work when you don't think about what you're doing.
Captain!
Want to join him in the ground?
Fire!
That shrimp is the gravity manipulator Nakahara Chuuya!
Did you just call me a shrimp, asshole?
I'm only fifteen years old!
I'm still growing!
It's over.
Tell me the reason for the attack.
What do you know about Arahabaki?
I guess we'll have to wait for our team's investigation report.
How unfortunate for you.
Does it hurt?
It's too late to save you.
Still, you won't be dead for another five minutes or so.
That's five minutes of hellish suffering.
I wouldn't be able to bear it.
Do you want me to end your suffering with this gun?
If you want to say yes, you should do it while you can still talk.
Shoot me, please.
All right.
This is more than you deserve.
Quit shooting dead bodies.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
What you say is probably correct.
That would be the normal way to think.

So cold...
The wind is coming through, and it's three times as cold.
Must have been rough, huh? Randou-san.
That was brutal.
Why me?
It's easy to guess why we were attacked.
The rumor is spreading.
If a Mori supporter like you were to die in a black explosion,
people would take the anger of the former boss more seriously.
One of the GSS soldiers he tore up on the way here
had these instructions for faking a black explosion.
What's a black explosion?
Apparently, you can get a black-ish flame
using a sodium lamp flame reaction.
Whatever the case, it's just a cheap trick.
So let me get this straight...
The GSS people attacked this guy, pretending to be Arahabaki,
in order to get the Port Mafia to turn on itself.
The current GSS president is a cold-hearted man.
Rumor has it that he has close ties to The Guild, a North American secret organization.
Tell me about Arahabaki as you saw it in Suribachi City.
That's the only lead we have on the resurrection of the former president.
I remember it clearly.
How could I ever forget?
I was the only survivor.
My subordinates all burned to ash.
They were engulfed by that black flame.
It was no doubt that god of fire.
This is getting interesting.
Tell us more.
It happened close to the center of Suribachi City.
We, the Port Mafia,
were on our way to battle the Sheep boys.
There, out of the blue, we were all blown away by a black explosion.
A sudden blastwave.
All I could do was protect myself with my ability.
Black flames.
Crumbling earth.
It was hell itself.
And in the middle, there it was.
It wasn't the former boss.
No... It wasn't even human.
A beast.
A beast of black flames.
Even its eyes were like the flames of purgatory.
Everything in sight was shimmering in the extreme heat,
except the Yokohama sea.
Just the sea, in the distance,
basking gently in the moonlight.
That alone is vivid in my memory.
That moment, I heard the voice of the beast.
It was a voice utterly devoid of emotion.
It terrified me.
I apologize.
You two wanted to prove that the former boss was not resurrected by Arahabaki,
and it was a hoax put together by enemy gifted, didn't you?
No.
That was interesting indeed.
Thanks to you, the mystery is solved.
Episode 27
The God of Fire
A derelict at the edge of town
Chuuya and Dazai collide violently
Tell me who's behind it!
No way!
Chuuya quickly closes in on Dazai
He unleashes a powerful downward kick
Dazai kicks the ground beneath him, leaping into the air away from Chuuya
As he descends, he swings down with the club in his hands
Hup!
Chuuya blocks with both hands
Agh!
Dazai lands on the ground
Immediately, Chuuya delivers a storm of punches
You don't get it, do you?!
No, I do.
Unlike a certain grade-school kid I happen to know!
Dazai takes a step back
Chuuya hammers him relentlessly with his fists
Come on, come on! You're never going to win if you're always on the defensive!
Well, too bad for you.
The club emits a destruction beam
Hang on a second!
Remember our promise?
The loser has to obey one order from the winner, like a dog.
Now, what should I have you do?
I was so sure I could win, too!
The strength of your ability is your downfall.
It's so strong that you never learn to be cunning or to think tactically,
whether it's video games or riddles.
Riddles?
I don't remember ever doing riddles, let alone losing!
Then let's have a contest to see who can catch the perpetrator first.
If you win, we can call off the bet we had.
But if I win, you're my dog for life.
You're on! I'll do it!
I'm neither cunning or tactical?
Why would I ever show you what I have up my sleeve?
Does the fact you always have your fists closed and engage with your opponents
using just your kicks have something to do with what you have up your sleeve?
How I fight is none of your business.
I see.
So you're being lazy on purpose.
Say, why are you looking for the god of fire, Arahabaki?
What got you interested?
Why are you so insistent on dying young?
What's wrong?
Shut up for a second!
Oh, those two.
The blue bracelets they're wearing...
They're members of the Sheep, aren't they?
Is there a problem?
Does this seem like a good time for them to see me?
Hey, Nakahara Chuuya-kun!
Let's get to work!
Boss's orders!
What are you, mental?!
Shut up, dammit!
Chuuya.
Finally, there you are.
We were looking for you.
Hey, guys.
You're safe.
Akira and Shougo were abducted by the Port Mafia.
Let's go to their base and give them some pain.
Like we always do.
Don't worry about that.
We're dealing with that right now.
Dealing with it?
Yeah, dealing with it.
Never mind that.
Could you tell me what you learned about Arahabaki?
Have you discovered anything?
Who's he?
Is he interested in joining?
Something like that.
Sorry, but would you mind answering his question?
Please.
Sure, I guess.
Based on our investigation, rumors about people seeing
the previous boss or the black flame have exploded in the past week.
What's the oldest confirmable rumor?
Probably eight years ago.
The giant explosion that created Suribachi City at the end of the conflict.
Arahabaki didn't cause any damage prior to that.
I thought so.
Is this kid really a newcomer to the Sheep?
More importantly, let's come up with a plan to get our guys back.
They were abducted from the factory road past the river.
Hang on. You went past the river?
You went to steal booze again?!
So close to the Port Mafia base?!
It's right in the middle of the conflict!
It's like asking to be abducted.
Please don't shout.
We're upholding our defensive policy, aren't we?
Besides, this is a good opportunity.
Lay your hands on the Sheep and we hit back a hundred times harder. Right?
Isn't it what you always say?
That anyone who has the means others don't,
they ought to fulfill that responsibility.
Fulfill your responsibility as someone who has an ability. Please.
That's great.
You two sure are interesting.
He's the one with the strongest power,
and he acts like a sheep in the eyes of wolves.
It seems that leading an organization
is a lot harder than you'd imagine.
You...
You can't take him with you, though.
He's busy carrying out the Port Mafia's orders right now.
Hey!
That's impossible!
Right, Chuuya?
You're with the Port Mafia?!
Oh, my, I'm scared.
You got me.
I'll do anything. Just don't kill me.
Oh, I know.
I'll ask Mori-san to release the hostages, so spare me.
Who told you to contact him? Dammit!
Are you listening to me?
Hey!
Hey, Mori-san?
Yeah.
We're making good progress on the work you ordered.
We're almost done.
Regarding that, I want to ask for a favor.
Could you release the Sheep hostages?
Yup, that's right.
Immediately. Unharmed.
Sure. Bye.
The guards are contacting me.
They've all been released?
What are you playing at?
Are we done here?
Let's go.
We have work to finish.
Work?
Chuuya doesn't do work for the Port Mafia.
Yeah.
You have no more hostages.
Let's go, Chuuya.
Chuuya?
Sorry. You guys go without me.
What are you talking about?
Arahabaki comes first.
I made a bet with him that I'd find it first.
Everyone's waiting for you to beat down the enemy!
Lay off him already.
He has the ability to choose for himself how to use his power.
Even a kid could figure out that much.
There's nothing to discuss here.
Are the rumors actually true?
That you betrayed the Sheep and joined the Port Mafia?
The Port Mafia has nothing to do with this.
This is my own problem.
Don't you dare forget, Chuuya!
You had no family or relatives when the Sheep accepted you!
Shit!
That should do it.
I can't wait.
Imagine how happy that brat's going to be when he finds out
he's getting such a grand party in honor of his new-found freedom.
Dazai-kun,
you said you found out who's behind Arahabaki.
Is that true?
Or did you lie to torment Chuuya-kun?
Both, of course.
I said what I did in front of him so he'd take on the bet,
but it's also true that I know who's behind it.
Oh?
Who is it?
You, Randou-san.
You impersonated the former boss and spread rumors about Arahabaki.
Do you have anything to say?
What's your reasoning?
You've made a mistake.
A very basic mistake.
And what mistake is that?
The sea.
When you saw Arahabaki and the black flames...
Just the sea, in the distance,
basking gently in the moonlight.
That alone is vivid in my memory.
I did say that.
Because that's what I saw.
What about it?
Are you sure you want me to spoil it for you?
Tell me.
It happened close to the center of Suribachi City,
and Suribachi City is a hemispherical basin valley
that was carved out by the explosion.
I see!
Exactly.
There's no way you would have seen the sea.
If you were inside a giant depression roughly two kilometers wide,
the sea would never be within sight, no matter how tall you stood.
Why, then, did you say you saw the sea?
You described Arahabaki with persuasiveness that was almost truthful.
So how?
It's because you did indeed see the sea.
That's why you made that mistake.
You could only have seen the sea from Suribachi City before it was made.
Before the giant explosion eight years ago, at the end of the conflict.
You had a bet with Chuuya-kun, didn't you?
Have you won that bet, then?
You've beat him to the man behind it all.
And now I've won the bet with the suicidal maniac.
It was your doing, Randou.
You aren't fooling me.
I knew all along that you were lying.
Okay, stop!
You!
Why are you here?
Just so you know, I made the announcement first.
I was just in the middle of explaining the method behind the crime.
In the middle of? So you weren't done?
Then I win.
There's no way you've won, but I'll let you explain how you deduced it.
How did you deduce that Randou-san was behind it?
What is there to deduce?
Anyone could have figured it out from what he said.
Every eyewitness so far has said they saw the former boss,
but this guy said he saw Arahabaki itself.
There is no such thing as gods, so you decided I did it.
Is that right?
No.
The opposite.
It's because gods do exist.
I know it.
You know that Arahabaki exists?
Yeah.
You saw it, too, didn't you?
Eight years ago.
There's no way you could have given such a precise account otherwise.
Chuuya-kun. Do you know where Arahabaki is right now?
Tell me.
You should tell him if you know.
Randou-san's going to be executed for putting the Port Mafia in danger, anyway.
Dammit, why the hell does everyone want to meet that thing?
It doesn't have the power to revive the dead.
It doesn't even have a personality or a mind.
It's the same as a typhoon or earthquake.
It doesn't need a personality.
Great destruction.
Scorching the earth, staining the skies, rumbling the air...
An unfathomable thing from the other side.
That power is enough for me.
Tell me, Chuuya-kun, where is this thing beyond human comprehension,
this thing that burned me alive?
I'll tell you if you really want to know.
Arahabaki is...
Me.
What?
I had a hunch that you were.
