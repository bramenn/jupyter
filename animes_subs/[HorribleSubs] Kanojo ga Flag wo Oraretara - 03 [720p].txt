Souta-kun.
Souta-kun.
Souta-kun.
Good morning,
Souta-kun.
Good morning...
Huh?! Why are you in my room?!
I just walked in.
Why all the noise...
We just woke up and you're trying to get down and dirty already?!
No, no.
This is what they do in France.
You're French?!
How did you unlock the door, anyway?
I borrowed the spare key from Kikuno-senpai.
Why does Okiku-nee have the spare key to my room?
She said that sisters can do that sort of thing.
What the hell?!
I heard that men really like it
when girls wake them up in the morning.
You should wake him up with me
so he'll be really happy!
You're triggering all the fun events, aren't you, Souta?
Why are you complaining about me?
Huh?
Oh, good morning, each and every one.
Th-This had to happen.
This is how men strengthen their friendships.
You perv.
Perv!
That's not it!
Why are you in my room, Megumu?!
I was pretty sure I went to the bathroom last night...
Oh, yeah!
I was half asleep, so Kikuno-senpai
helped me back to my room.
Behind all great mysteries, there is a sister.
Sou-kun, breakfast's ready.
Hm?
Sou-kun's surrounded by women so early in the morning.
Your sister's so proud!
She planned all of it.
I-I'm a guy, though...
Kikuno-senpai will do anything to make sure Souta is happy!
She's ruthless!
Wh-What was that?
If Her Flag Breaks
Flag 3
Leave it to Me, We Have a 99.9 Chance We're Going to Win This Athletic Meet
Mahougasawa Group
What's this?
A-A girl?
Operation system check: OK.
Each part operation check: OK.
The main system start.
Hello world.
She's speaking English! She's robot!
I guess Akane thinks all the robots come from America.
Nice to meet you.
I have been assigned to the Quest Dorm cluster as of today.
My name is Ninjabayashi Ruri.
She's speaking Japanese! She's a robot!
So the language doesn't even matter!
It's a pleasure
to meet you all.
I'm sorry about that.
There was a slight error in my connections
due to the shock of falling in that container.
Wrong way.
To continue,
I was dispatched from Mahougasawa Electronics
to help Akane-ojousama with her life here.
She pretended like nothing happened...
Mahougasawa Electronics?
So she's related to Akane-chan's family?
Just call me Akane.
You don't have to add the ojousama.
In order to abbreviate your name, I need to be in administrator mode.
Would you like to enter your password and change me to administrator mode?
Yes or no.
I don't know the password!
Password is incorrect.
Would you like to enter it again?
Yes or no.
I don't know the password!
Would you like to enter it again?
This is going to go on forever!
Now Sou-kun has more girls in his life.
Your sister won't know what to do with herself.
Sou-kun, remember to restrain yourself! You can't just jump at the girls.
I'm sure that's why she was sent here.
The daughter of the Mahougasawa family is
staying here in a dorm with men, albeit just one.
Yeah, I can see why they'd worry about
having her live with a guy who acted like he just rode into her life.
You may have just rode in,
but it was on a thoroughbred!
I still just rode in, though.
But you're acting like you'll be sent for slaughter.
That was a strangely real example.
Have I been accepted into this cluster?
Yes! We'd be glad to have you!
Right, right?
I don't see the problem.
The more the merrier.
Men are ready for anything!
Well, if everyone insists...
Ruri-chan is blushing!
Just like a real human!
I'm not blushing.
Really? You look like
I'm not.
You couldn't have gotten Ruri's flag, too, did you?
I don't think robots have flags...
I think, anyway.
Oh, no.
We have to hurry.
We're going to be late if we don't leave soon.
That was quite the commotion this morning.
Nanami-chan, that's my bag.
Sou-kun, this is the perfect chance for me to carry you on my back.
I think I'll be fine by myself.
Anyway, Ruri-chan, could you watch the house for us
Let's get going.
As you can see, I'm fully functional.
All right, let's play our lunch show's first number!
That's some nice electricity you're using.
You sure got settled in quickly your first day.
You're a good girl,
so I'm glad you got along with everyone in class.
I think someone here should follow Ruri's lead
and become a bit better themselves.
Sorry I'm a bad apple.
What are you saying?
You're nice, Souta-kun!
Don't berate yourself, Sou-kun!
I'll wash your hair when we take a bath later!
If you're a bad apple, I'll be a bad apple, too!
Must be nice getting so much love every day.
Sorry to interrupt the song,
but we have an announcement from Seiteikouji Mimori,
the student council president.
My beloved students, Hatagaya Academy!
Student Council President
By the way Hatagaya Academy is an
original earth-shattering greeting that I invented.
What?
Anyway, it's almost time for our school track meet,
and I want to scale it up this year.
Track Meet Week
I'm calling it the Track Meet Week.
It's a week-long event that has all different types of
events that take place from morning all the way through the night.
It's a huge, non-stop event.
The students will spend a week dueling it out,
and the best team will be designated MVP!
This is great!
It sounds so fun!
I'll be able to see Sou-kun kicking butt for a week!
I'm so happy!
I know, right?
What events are you guys doing?
I'm going to do the three-legged race with Sou-kun!
No, that's no fair!
I want to do it, too.
Me, too! Me, too!
You guys always look like you're having so much fun.
Man, with all of this going on...
We've discussed things, and we've decided to wrap you up,
put Megu-chan on top of you, and then Kikuno-senpai and I will drag you
while we do the three-legged race together.
Is that some kind of torture?
They forgot what they were after in the beginning.
Hey. I was looking for you guys.
I'm glad to see you all getting along again today.
Yes, we're very grateful for
your having fixed the Quest Dorm.
Though, granny was the one that helped the most.
Right. So anyway,
About Quest Dorm...
Sorry. You might get shut down after all.
What?!
Student Council President
I mean, our tentative chairwoman.
Apparently this Quest Dorm only has five residents.
It doesn't make sense to run this facility with so few people.
It's also co-ed.
I'm so jealous
I mean this is untenable!
Don't cry!
We weren't trying to give you a hard time.
We were just discussing the situation...
I was just faking it.
Why you...
It's sad that you're taking your problems out on someone else,
just because you didn't have fun while you were younger.
Y-You shouldn't have said that!
It's a co-ed dorm because we haphazardly decided to let him
transfer in when all the male dorms were already full.
Also, the members of the Quest Dorm have strong bonds
and trust one another, much more than any other club or dorm.
It would be sheer foolishness to attempt to dismantle that.
There's not a single good that would come from it.
I wouldn't be surprised if they got MVP in the school meet.
You think so?!
No co-ed team has ever made MVP!
So envious!
There'll be too much flirting going on for them to get anywhere!
I see.
So if they don't make MVP, we shut down Quest Dorm.
We expel Hatate-kun from our school.
Sure. I'll accept those conditions.
We didn't say anything like that...
I'll show you the ultimate team!
This is your fault!
Now, let's show those crazy adults your
What do you mean Sou-kun might get expelled?!
I-I-It'll be fine.
I-I-I have a plan.
Okiku-nee, I think that's enough, don't you?
Sou-kun, you're so kind.
Your sister's so happy to see you've grown up to be such a great kid.
I was so scared!
You guys don't need to join them.
Well, I was just pretending to cry.
I've verified that your tear ducts are fully dilated.
In addition, there seems to be some moisture
that was expelled from the lower part of your body.
I didn't wet myself!
A-Anyway, you know how it is.
I've got you some excellent help for the meet,
so cut me some slack.
Help?
Someone with excellent leadership skills
that will help you all become MVPs.
Anyway, I'm going to stop by the restroom
I mean the student council's office.
It'll be okay!
When you get expelled, I'll go with you!
I won't leave you alone, either.
We'll ride the harsh seas of society together as men.
You're expecting me to get expelled, huh?
I wonder who the help's gonna be.
Maybe another dorm mate!
What if it's a scary guy... Huh, Souta-kun?
Discipline... is needed!
I'm in class 2-F, Eiyuuzaki Rin.
I will be entering Quest Dorm in order to
make sure you become MVPs.
I normally wouldn't want to work for some weakling who
gets pushed around by a bunch of girls.
However, I owe the president a favor.
I do not wish to be here, but I will do the job to the best of my ability.
Your typical hates men flag...
Now, now, Rin-chan, you'll scare the kids if you're too angry.
Okiku. I don't even understand why you're here.
What's the point of being around this random guy?
I know him, so he's not random.
He's random.
Rin-chan was in my class last year.
We talked to each other, even while I was overseas.
You only ever talked about your neighbors and brother in your letters.
Sou-kun this, and Sou-kun that...
Wait a second...
That's Sou-kun?!
That's right.
So you were able to see him again?
I'm glad for you.
But that doesn't mean I'm going to hold back!
Since you're the only man here,
I'm going to work you as hard as I can!
Uh, well, Megumu is male, too...
Oh, yeah. Megu-chan was here, too.
I nearly forgot myself.
Amending data: rewriting gender from female to male.
Male?
He's cuter than I am.
Whatever!
Anyway, I'm just here to help you get MVP!
Understood?!
Rise!
What's going on...
It's not even six yet.
You're trying to become MVPs looking like that?
Straighten yourselves up!
Why are we up so early?
Isn't it obvious? We train.
So what happened to Okiku and Ruri?
Okiku-nee only wakes up when she wants to,
regardless of what's going on.
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
We need to at least get Ruri out here.
I am currently operating in sleep mode.
There are twenty minutes remaining before I am finished charging.
After which, it will take five minutes for a system refresh.
Please wait twenty-five minutes until I am operational.
R-Right.
You're not very good with electronics?
Th-That was rude.
I'm great with them!
I can type texts with one hand!
This is also water resistant.
Pretty cool, right?
Strangely cute.
Anyway, we don't have time!
We need to start training.
Hurry up and change!
Run faster! Faster!
We're working those biceps.
Now, pull ups...
Become the bunny!
What an exhausting day...
Hm? Where's Sou-kun and Rin-chan?
Rin-senpai said she was going for another run,
and dragged Souta along with her.
Rin-senpai's a Spartan.
Let me take a short break.
You're tired already?
Guys are useless.
You're pretty strict.
I'm trying pretty hard.
Trying pretty hard so you can live surrounded by women?
Ridiculous drivel.
Oh, no! For some reason, Megu-chan's...
I don't know why Okiku and the others are working so hard for you.
Neither do I.
Why are you acting like this doesn't have anything to do with you?
The dorm will be shut down and you'll be kicked out.
Yeah, I know everyone's working hard for me.
Yet everything feels so surreal.
Maybe it's because I've been alone for so long.
Nothing but trivialities and complaints from you.
You're a pathetic man.
What type of a guy do you like, anyway?
Isn't that obvious?
I wonder if Rin-senpai has always been hard on men like that?
There was a boy she was really close to when she was younger.
I think his name was...
His name was Souda.
He's the only man I like in the entire world.
You're going to become my lackey today.
Not happening.
You're a wimp, Souda!
Don't call me Souda!
Every boy knew I was better than them,
and Souda was the only one who'd try to face me head-on.
And eventually we
did everything together.
I felt like I could do anything
with him by my side.
Souda!
Souda!
Souda!
His name was Souda.
He will be forever my best friend.
Listen,
there are some men in this world you could never dream of living up to.
That's a coincidence.
I used to be called Souda a long time ago.
It's a small world after all.
I think I'll tell him about you.
We moved apart, but I still text him.
You've got mail.
I was just talking about you, Souda.
It got me to thinking about our past.
I miss you.
Huh?
Rin...kun?
Sou...da?
You were just a kid bully!
When did you start dressing like a girl?!
I was always a girl!
And you, you used to be lively and straight-forward...
Why are you all pessimistic, like you've given up on life?!
Are you okay?
No fair...
Huh?
This sucks! Why are you like this only now?
You keep getting more manly...
Huh? Rin-kun...
You hate me now, don't you?
I don't...
Of course you do!
I kept saying all those bad things about you...
I was an insufferable woman.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This is what happens when a
pathological love drives someone to insane actions...
The yandere flag...
I don't want to get involved, but...
I-It's okay.
My friendship with you wouldn't end just because of something like this.
Really?
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, you're right.
You're Souda!
Souda! Souda!
Huh?
The conquest complete flag?!
Rin-kun, why...
Why are you so easy...
So Sou-kun was Rin-chan's childhood friend, Souda.
Running into a childhood friend. It's like fate!
Why didn't you two notice?
So what happened?
Well, he was embarrassed about being called Souda and all.
So I've been calling him Souta now.
It looks like you're talking about the scene that just happened.
I've recorded it.
Would you like me to replay it?
Yes or no.
No! No!
Well, could you give the file to me
I've deleted it.
Is everyone ready?!
Yes.
The fate of Souta and Quest Dorm depends on this battle.
We cannot lose!
Right!
Yeppers.
Of course!
I'd imagine so.
Roger that.
Now, it's time for track meet week!
Let's go!
Right!
Roar! Gawo!
Why have a school track meet for a week?
How about we make it an hour instead?
We might as well just have PE, then!
The longer it is, the more Souta can cheer me on!
Hey, Souta. Don't stare at me with such passion...
I can't even see flags, and I can tell how easy hers is.
Flag 4
We're Almost to the Goal. The Track Meet'll End Just Fine.
Roar! Gawo!
Will you watch next time? (Yes/Yes)
