As our heroes travel onward, a new challenge awaits them,
and so do many new and unusual Pokemon.
-Pi? -Huh? What's the matter, Pikachu?
-Pika-pi! -Hey! Pikachu!
-Pikachu. - Huh?
-Why's it tied up like that? -It's been abandoned.
-What? -No way.
You mean that someone just left it here alone?
That's cruel.
Eevee. The evolution Pokemon.
It has the potential to evolve into any one of three different Pokemon.
Whoa! Then I want one.
I don't think you should.
-Why not? -Take a look at this.
A tag? Hmm.
Stone Town?
Stone town? That's the place at the foot of Evolution Mountain.
Eevee evolves into one of three Pokemon,
depending on what stone is used on it.
Using a fire stone will yield Flareon, the flame Pokemon.
A water stone yields Vaporeon, the bubble jet Pokemon.
A thunder stone yields Jolteon, the lighting Pokemon.
Huh, I'd love a Vaporeon.
Oh, big surprise, Misty. All you ever think about is water Pokemon.
It sounds to me like you want to keep that Eevee all to yourself.
Well, if you really want something, you have to go for it.
Hmm. That's it. Third block, number 14.
- Wow. - It's gigantic.
-It's a garden party. -Looks like fun.
-Hey, guys. Look there. - Huh?
Congratulations. Poliwhirl evolved into Poliwrath.
Thank you so much.
Wow. That's so amazing.
Poliwrath.
-Cloyster. -Vileplume.
Exeggutor.
Raichu.
Ninetales.
They've all been evolved using those stones.
Amazing.
Ooh! Look at all those evolved Pokemon.
We've got to have them.
They're ripe and just ready for picking.
It says here Stone Town has these special stones
that help Pokemon evolve.
Baloney. That's why we came to Evolution Mountain,
to get some of those special stones,
and I couldn't find a single stone anywhere.
You dug in the wrong place, Team Rocket scientist.
Well, we'll worry about those stones later.
-I want some of that food. -Stones can wait.
Let's grab some grub, shall we?
Stop thinking about food!
Good work.
Now that we've seen a round of evolution, how about comparing attacks, eh?
-Eevee? - Huh?
-Ha-ha-ha. - Eevee.
-Where did you go to? -We were worried about you, Eevee.
Yeah, thank you for finding Eevee for us.
This is great. We've got our star, now we can go on with the show.
-Eevee's a star? -Uh, then why was it tied up?
Mikey. Hey, Mikey! Eevee's come back.
Oh.
How could you lose him? You've got to be careful.
You'll lose your trainer qualification.
Did Eevee really escape?
But it was tied to a tree, right?
Why did you bring it back?
Huh?
Listen, Mikey.
One day you'll be a Pokemon trainer just like us.
Do you really think you can win your first battle
with an unevolved Eevee?
All of us won our first battles because we've evolved our Eevees.
There's no other way to win.
The key to a first victory is evolution.
But I don't care about battles.
Don't care?
-Vaporeon! -Jolteon!
-They're scary. -Pika.
Everyone is waiting to see what you make Eevee evolve into, Mikey.
You've got three choices.
Which do you think is the strongest of all the evolved Eevees?
We want to know what you think of our Pokemon.
Mikey, which Pokemon do you want Eevee to become?
A thunder stone will make it a Jolteon.
When a Jolteon gets mad, the hairs on its body turn to needles.
Then it fires at its opponent.
A water stone will make it a Vaporeon.
It can melt into water and make itself disappear.
A fire stone will make it a Flareon.
With a blazing flame attack released from its internal fire sack,
Flareon is the strongest evolutionary choice of all.
Flare!
What, are you crazy? My Jolteon is the strongest of all.
Too bad you're the only one who thinks so.
Heh, Mikey, I'm sure you'll make the right choice
and make it a Vaporeon.
This family sure is competitive, Ash.
That's a lot of pressure to put on the little guy.
Hey, give the kid a break, will you?
Isn't he a little young to battle?
We're throwing this party just for him and his Eevee.
You should know you have to start training early if you want to become a master.
Yeah, one of these days, you'll turn that Pikachu into a Raichu won't you?
Huh? Well, I, uh...
Pika, pika?
Do you need a stone?
Aw.
Wow, water stones, and thunder and fire.
You really have collected a lot of them.
That's what our town's known for.
But you can't mine them all the time.
-Ha! Look at those beautiful stones. -It's like a rock concert.
That's a special edition of the Pokemon Friend.
Yeah, we used it to plan today's special evolution party.
We wanted to bring together all the trainers
that specialize in stone-induced evolution.
Why don't you join our club, Ash? Here, take this thunder stone.
What have you got, Brock?
I've got a Vulpix that will become a Ninetales.
Vulpix.
Then why don't you just make it evolve? Here, take this fire stone.
But I...
I can't just force Vulpix to evolve.
Vulpix is really important to me.
Don't be dumb!
Hey, take it easy. You don't have to yell.
Evolution is what Pokemon are all about.
Horsea. Horsea.
It's been a while, hasn't it? Have a good swim, Horsea.
Horsea.
Huh?
-Huh? -Hungry?
- Psy? -Huh?
Psy.
Stop that!
Want some?
Uh-huh.
-Is it good? -Mm-hm.
Pika?
It doesn't seem like you really want to make Eevee evolve, do you, Mikey?
My brothers don't care about anything but battling Pokemon.
And what about you, Mikey?
I was trying to hide Eevee from them, just for today.
Then nobody could force me to make it evolve at the party.
But Eevee looked very, very lonely out there.
Chu.
I was going to go get it later.
I don't care if Eevee evolves or not. I just want it to be my best friend.
That's great.
Huh? You think that's great?
-There's only one thing wrong. -What's that?
You shouldn't have hidden Eevee.
You were just running away from your problems.
Running away?
If you don't want Eevee to evolve, tell your brothers how you feel.
That's your responsibility as a trainer.
But, hey, I'm not your mother or anything.
No. You're right.
If you hadn't claimed Eevee,
I was going to keep it and change it into Vaporeon myself.
You were, Misty?
Pi, pika. Pikachu.
-Pika. Pikachu. I wonder what they're saying.
A while ago, Pikachu decided not to evolve.
Really?
Pika. Pikachu.
-You just don't get it, do you? -We get it, all right.
We just don't evolve our Pokemon that way.
You like your way of evolving, and we like ours.
That's the way to tell them, Brock.
Come on. Let's move on to the main event so they can see evolution our way.
Good idea.
Mikey!
Have you decided on Eevee's evolution yet?
Uh... Uh... I'll, mm...
-Come right out and tell him, Mike. -Uh... Uh...
Hmm...
Come on, Mikey. Tell us what you decided.
Go ahead. Tell him, Mikey. You can do it.
Pikachu.
Hmm.
-A Jolteon, right? -A Flareon, right?
A Vaporeon.
Aw, you guys, I, uh...
It's show time, everybody.
Who invited you?
-Prepare for trouble. -And make it double.
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above...
-Jessie. -James.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
That's delicious.
Keep your eyes open, guys.
Team Rocket will steal your Pokemon if you're not careful.
Weezing, spread a smokescreen.
Weezing.
I can't see anything!
Pidgeotto, blow the smokescreen away.
Gust attack!
-My Jolteon! -Vaporeon!
Flareon!
-Where's Eevee? -Pikachu!
Oh, no! My Horsea is gone!
Help! Help! My Poliwrath's gone!
The stones are gone!
All the food is gone too!
Those creeps took everything.
Team Rocket took the stones, and they took the food too.
-Psy! -Why couldn't they take you too?
The balloon! They're getting away!
Pidgeotto, attack that balloon!
You did it! Good work, Pidgeotto.
Huh?
-It's empty. -No.
Pidgeotto, go find Team Rocket.
A piece of cake.
That was easier than taking candy from a baby.
Candy and cold cuts and Pokemon too.
-We've outdone ourselves, James. -Outdone ourselves, outsmarted them.
Pika, pika. Pikachu!
Ah, nothing tastes better than a victory meal.
We've gotten beaten so many times, I'd forgotten what victory tasted like.
Ooh!
I don't ever want you to call us losers again.
From now on, we'll be known as Team Rocket, champions of the world.
Champions of the entire world!
Why don't you two dry up? It's time make that little one evolve.
All right. Evolution time.
What we need is a really evil-looking Pokemon.
That's why we need it to be a Jolteon. Argh!
-Who said you get to decide? -Yeah, who said?
I'll turn it into Flareon.
What? Wait a minute. Vaporeon is so much more villainous.
Jolteon's the best of the worst!
Flareon and its passionate flames.
Cool Vaporeon!
- Jolteon is the best! - Vaporeon is much stronger!
Time out, Team Rocket. I've got an idea.
-Huh? -What is it?
We'll use all three stones on Eevee at the same time.
It's bound to evolve into something really evil.
-All right. Sounds bad. -Count me in!
Go!
-Squirtle, water gun attack now! - Huh?
Squirtle. Squirtle.
-Squirt! -Psy!
Embarrassing.
-Psy! - Embarrassing is right.
Squirtle, it looks like it's up to you.
Squirt, Squirtle, squirt! Squirt!
-Now let's go rescue the Pokemon. -Yeah!
Not so fast.
Huh! Eevee!
How did you ever find us all the way out here?
Yeah, it's the first time we didn't mess up.
Well, you see, Horsea spit out a trail of ink to show us the way.
-Pretty smart, huh? -Horsea.
Unbelievable! That little squirt screwed up our perfect plan.
I guess we'll just have to settle for little Eevee.
Forget it, you old hag! We won't let you do that!
What? What? What did you just call me?
Wow, Jessie just evolved into a Flareon!
-Ready for battle? - Okay.
Weezing!
Weezing.
Arbok!
Arbok!
Attack, Arbok. Show that puny little punk who's boss.
I'm not puny!
-Ready, Pikachu? -Pika.
Wait. That's our brother's Eevee. It's our job to save it.
-Let's go, Rainer, Pyro. - Yeah!
Brothers!
Watch the power of an evolved Pokemon!
-Jolteon, attack! -Jolt!
-Vaporeon, attack! -Por!
-Flareon, attack! -Flare! Flare! Flare!
-Arbok, poison sting attack! -Cha!
Jolteon, pin missile, fire!
Ar!
-Weezing. -Weezing, hit it with a sludge attack!
Vaporeon, use your acid armor and fight back!
Weez, weezing.
Vaporeon, attack!
-Weez! -Poreon!
Run for it!
Don't let them get away! Flareon, fire spin!
Flare!
- Yeah! -All right!
We beat you. Now, hand over the Eevee.
We're not finished.
Cha!
-Jolteon! -Jolteon!
-Vaporeon! -Flareon!
So you thought you had us beat, did you?
We're the champion Team Rocket.
Champions?
-Ash, quick! -Let's go, Pikachu.
Pika, pika, Pikachu!
-We can't lose this battle to them. -Especially on our first day as champions.
Let's get them!
-What? -They still want to fight?
There's something different about Team Rocket.
-Pika. -
Oh, Eevee.
Hang in there.
-Jolteon. -Vaporeon.
Flareon.
Uh-oh.
-It's time to finish them off. -Victory.
All right, Eevee! Get ready!
It's time for our first real battle!
-That little guy sure is brave. -Go get them!
Pikachu!
Eevee, take down attack.
What's this, a stuffed animal?
Rage tackle attack!
What?
Victory?
It looks like champion Team Rocket...
Is blasting off again!
Yeah!
-Eevee! -Wow! You're the greatest, Eevee!
-You did it, Mikey. -That was really cool.
-Beautiful. -Pika, pika.
Mikey.
Winning your first battle by yourself, that's incredible.
And you won without making Eevee evolve. I was wrong.
You always said you didn't want to battle, but you did great.
I just wanted to help everybody out.
Hey, you guys. I've decided to become an Eevee trainer.
Hmm? -An Eevee trainer?
Well, Mikey, if that's what you want to do, then do it.
If you felt that way about it, you should have told us sooner.
Now we really are the four Eevee brothers.
My brothers are the best.
-Congratulations, Mikey. -Thanks!
Hey, guys, let's make this party a celebration of Eevee's first victory.
Mm-hm.
Congratulations.
-You did it, Mikey. -Yeah.
-Uh, Miss Misty? -What is it?
I wanted to thank you for helping me.
-For you. -Oh, it's beautiful, Mikey.
I'm sure you'll become a great Eevee trainer.
-Friends forever? -Friends forever.
Mikey! Mikey! Mikey!
That's so sweet. It must be nice to have big brothers.
You could pass for my brother.
Grasshopper have little sense, but big mouth.
Pika, pika.
Psy-ay-ay-ay!
Psyduck, Psyduck, psy!
Team Rocket has been defeated once again,
and all the Pokemon have been reunited with their rightful trainers.
And Mikey and his brothers have learned an important lesson.
All of us must have the courage to follow our own true path.
Well, it's back to eating the lunch of losers.
Victory tasted a lot better.
I don't think this stuff is really too bad. Ow!
Hey, is that the attitude of a future champ?
No.
Just you wait.
Team Rocket will be champions of the world.
Mm-hm.
Someday.
