Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
I bet I'll scare the pants off Happy with this!
Even Erza might be surprised!
Wait...
I bet Lucy's reaction would be the best of the bunch!
This is the end for you. Get it, Boy?
Damn it! My transmissions to Wally and Millianna are being intercepted!
Now I don't have any idea where they are!
Transmissions?
Telepathic Communication Magic, yes?
Are you okay, Sho?
Yeah.
Since you're here for me...
Heaven's Game!
Hey, can we really trust him?
I accept that he wasn't trying to kill us, but...
I have no intention of making excuses.
You heard me then?
Any wizard that'd die from something like that would be no match for Jellal.
And I was confident that Natsu wouldn't die.
Uh, what about me, then?
You people haven't realized Natsu's true power.
When Natsu obtains the true power of the dragon,
he will destroy all evil before him!
I can't wipe around my mouth!
Eww!
Maybe I really should take this off...
Wait, it won't come off!
Goodbye, Boy...
What?
Don't!
Millianna?
It's the blockhead!
What are you doing?
No bullying kitty-cats!
That's not a cat! Just look at him!
Why, you...
Out of the way, Millia!
He's an enemy, get it?
Take this!
Cat Barrier!
The kitty-cat!
I told you, it's not a cat! It's an enemy!
An enemy? Even though it's a kitty-cat?
There's a person inside!
Cat Fire!
Not bad. I can see why Jellal said to watch out for you, Boy.
Millia, back me up!
Pretending to be a kitty cat when you're a person? That's totally un-spiffy!
You're one to talk!
Cat-ch you tubes!
Excellent work, Millianna.
Wally, get that impostor cat!
Just watch, Millia!
Cat Fire!
Huh?
What the...
I can't use magic all of a sudden!
Is it this thing's fault?
I hate impostor cats!
That's as far as you go, Salamander.
Die!
This ain't good!
Oops. I almost forgot to say my dandy catch phrase.
From the moment you met me...
Happy!
Natsu, I'm so glad you're safe!
And wait, what's with the helmet?
Whatever, just help me get free!
Aye!
Why that... How dare you interrupt my catch phrase!
Don't!
Don't bully kitty-cats!
Cats can't fly!
I'll let the talking slide, but the flying?
Happy, now's our chance!
Aye, sir!
Not on your life!
I said don't!
Let me go!
Hurry up, Happy!
This thing's not coming off so easy!
Damn it... I'm gonna have to do that!
Secret Move!
Cat in Distress.
Whoa, it worked!
What are you doing, Millianna?
But the kitty-cat was...
No buts!
All righty then!
Go forth, Natsu!
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
My revenge on the blockhead is complete!
How long do you plan on wearing that?
I can't get it off...
Sho and Simon have turned against me.
Wally and Millianna have fallen to Salamander.
This is how it should be. There is nothing more boring than a one-sided game.
Lord Jellal, let us hurry and capture Erza to begin the ceremony.
This is no longer the time to be playing around.
Then why don't you go, Vidaldus?
Are you sure?
It's our turn next, yes?
The Assassin's Guild, Death's Head Caucus.
Vidaldus Taka.
Go to hell!
Hell! I'll show you the lowest pits of the ultimate hell!
Fukuro.
And their commander, Ikaruga.
Love and life are fated to be broken asunder, yes?
This eve shall be a festival.
We are from the Death's Head Caucus of the Assassin's Guild.
The Special Guerrilla Squad: Trinity Raven, have arrived.
It's your turn now.
Go.
H-Happy!
What?
P-Pull harder!
I'm pulling as hard as I can!
You're gonna tear my head off!
It came off!
Now it's the blockhead who's trapped!
I wonder what's with that mask's head-hole?
Our showdown isn't over yet, Salamander!
I've already paid you back.
And since Erza and Happy are safe, I don't have any reason to keep fighting.
Yeah!
We're going to heaven!
The true freedom that Jellal talks about...
The world where we can rule...
Jellal!
I am Jellal.
The ruler of this tower.
Both of our pieces are in place.
What?
It's Jellal. He can be heard throughout the tower.
Isn't it about time to get things started?
Heaven's Game!
A game?!
Jellal!
The rules are simple.
I wish to use Erza as the living sacrifice to hold the ceremony to resurrect Zeref.
Jellal...
In other words, if the door to heaven opens, victory is mine.
If you can prevent me from doing that,
then you win.
However that alone would not be any fun.
So I have assembled three warriors.
Three warriors?
Who?
If you cannot overcome them, then you will not reach me.
In other words it is a 3 vs. 8 battle royal.
Oh, and one final thing.
It is possible that the Magic Council will attack this place from the Satellite Square.
With the ultimate magic that returns everything to nothingness, Etherion!
That wasn't in the deal, Jellal!
You bastard! We get hit with that, and we're all going to hell!
Vidaldus, my dear...
Might you be turning tail?
No, the total opposite!
Reverse!
This is the ultimate high!
I've been waiting for a dangerous job like this!
No one knows how long we have left.
But when Etherion is fired, everything will be wiped out.
The game will be over, with no players left.
What is he thinking?
Etherion?
The Council is doing what?
I don't believe it.
Erza!
Sho, what are you doing?
Now...
Let's have fun.
I won't let anyone harm Sister!
Hey, Sho!
I will defeat Jellal myself!
Stop this! It's impossible alone!
All right! I'm all fired up!
I suppose this Jellal guy is at the top, right?
What are you doing, Jellal?
Etherion? If that's fired, then everyone will...
All we ever wanted was true freedom...
I don't know what kinda freedom you're searchin' for,
but the freedom we have in Fairy Tail is pretty awesome.
Happy!
There are ways to cheat at games, right?
Aye!
Let's head to the very top right away!
Aye, sir!
Salamander...
That's a nice... scarf... you've got...
Something's coming.
What the heck was that?
Salamander!
Huh? Who are you?
Natsu, he's one of the blockhead's buddies!
Which means you're one of Jellal's lackeys?
No! I'm on your side!
I was always just pretending to be fooled by Jellal.
In order to stop him.
I don't believe you!
Wait.
That's true?
Yes.
Who is this Jellal guy?
Why'd he set up this idiotic game?
He's the younger twin brother of a member of the Magic Council, Siegrain.
He must have realized ahead of time that the council would use Etherion.
What, it's some fight between brothers?
I wonder about that...
Even I don't have any idea what happened between them.
That's...
I will not permit you to break the rules!
I will pass judgment upon you in the name of justice!
The Warrior of Justice, Fukuro, is here!
It's a bird!
That bird's blabbing about justice?
Oh, no... Dark Moment!
I can't see!
I knew it, he's the enemy!
Now's your chance!
Go! Don't even try to take that guy on!
Fine.
The Owl of Justice can see through the darkness!
Justice Hoo-Hoo-Hoot!
How do you like it?
Hey, are you okay?
Then... This must be the Assassin's Guild, Death's Head Caucus!
Assassin's Guild?
One of the dark guilds.
They don't do proper jobs.
They're the worst kind of guild that specializes in assassination requests!
And the three person team called, Trinity Raven,
assassinated every officer in the Western Army in the Cabria War!
They're a legendary unit!
And that guy's one of the members of the squad? Er... flock?
I only eliminated evil!
He's a professional assassin!
You can't fight him!
Salamander! Your evil deeds have reached our guild's ears!
Today this warrior of justice will bury your evil!
Guilds are places where our trust and dreams are gathered together.
They ain't places for doin' dirty work!
Stand back, Salamander!
You can't fight members of the Assassin's Guild!
I don't like those assassination jobs.
I don't like the people who request'em, either.
I don't like that you call it a guild.
And because I don't like'em, I'm gonna bust'em up!
Bring it on, birdbrain!
So naive, Salamander!
There is evil in this world that cannot be left alive!
Thrusters!
You are one of those who should best disappear!
Jet! Hoo-Hoo-Hoot!
Natsu!
I ain't gonna lose to fire, buddy!
Thrusters, once again!
Throw!
Natsu!
Oww!
You're pretty sturdily built there.
This will be a rare job worth doing!
Trinity Raven... They're beyond even the rumors...
And there are three of them?
How pitiful, Simon. And the game has just begun.
So next we have Fukuro vs. Natsu Dragneel.
I had hoped Natsu would get to the top,
but perhaps he's at a disadvantage.
Natsu!
Natsu-san!
Natsu!
He's got really sharp ears, so he should be able to hear us from anywhere.
Same as Gajeel-kun, then.
In that case his nose should also be good.
You call him -kun?
Note: -kun is an honorific used for young boys and people lower than your status.
I wonder why Juvia is searching for Natsu-san together with you, Lucy-san?
Ignoring me, I see?
Um, what else can we do?
I'm worried about Erza, so I'm going after Sho!
I'll leave you two to find Natsu.
I shall do it for Gray-sama's sake,
but to be stuck with one's rival in love...
I can only imagine the carnage that will ensue!
Look, I'm trying really hard not to be involved in this.
Let's get along,'kay?
What's that horrible noise?
A guitar?
Man, that's loud!
Juvia thinks he's pretty good.
Something is wrong with you, seriously.
It's a live performance from hell! Destroy!
Get a haircut!
The Assassin's Guild, Death's Head Caucus!
It means skull, get it? Pretty awesome name, huh?
The three warriors that Jellal was talking about, then?
I'm one of Trinity Raven.
Vidaldus Taka, that's me!
Rock you!
Hey, you got an interesting body there.
Juvia's body is made of water.
Drip, drip, drop.
Go get'im, Juvia!
I'll just get out of your way, and...
There is no attack that will work against Juvia.
Water Lock!
Rock?
You're a rocker too?
Nothing but talk.
You weren't one of the Element 4 for nothing!
You'd be pretty scary as an enemy...
Juvia's Water Lock has disappeared!
And... Eww!
It's best to wash out your hair with water in the morning.
Shampooing every day will damage your hair.
You bastard... How did you break the Water Lock?
My hair can absorb liquid.
But no oil or alcohol, please... That would damage it.
Water is ineffective?
Oh, no!
But you girls ain't so bad looking!
There it is! As usual!
What are you talking about?
Being cute is the source of all my troubles.
Eeny-meeny-miny-moe...
Which-one-will-be-come-my-hell's-min-ion?
All set!
You'll be my succubus today!
Succubus?
Rock of Succubus!
What is this sound?
No, stop it!
Juvia, what's wrong?
Don't! Don't come inside Juvia!
So that's as far as the water woman goes, eh?
And, at the same time...
Juvia!
Become my slave!
Hell, hell, hell!
I'll show you the lowest pits of the ultimate hell!
What's happened?
I heard that Erza was lonely and couldn't get close to anyone as a kid.
I can't even imagine it now.
I bet that she puts on a tough shell to protect her heart from the pain of her past.
Well she is always wearing armor...
That's not what I meant. I mean she closes off her heart.
Next time: Heart's Armor.
Uh, you're talkin' too complicated. I don't get you, Happy.
That's'cause you're full-open, Natsu.
Oven? We baking somethin'?
