Goodbye.
We're going now.
Tabitha!
Where are you going?
Don't tell me you're...
I'm going back to Gallia.
Why all of a sudden?!
Because if I keep hearing your voice,
I'll lose my resolve.
Tabitha...
He'll really be surprised if we attack this early.
Oh.
It's the Elemental Siblings.
What are you doing here?!
Isn't it obvious?
We're here to kill you.
Huh?
Shut up and fight!
Elves from the Desert
If we continue straight,
we should come out behind the barbarian's mansion.
I hope she's still there.
I can't wait to meet her.
I wonder what she's like?
Lukshana! What if the barbarians see you?
Who's going to see me in the middle of this huge forest?
Let's hurry up and go.
Your fiancee is just as audacious
and impatient as ever.
She's a good girl.
As long as that unchecked barbarian lover isn't around...
Don't get in our way.
I'm his champion.
Your hair has the same color as the royal family of Gallia.
We actually have some ties to Gallia.
Knights of the North Parterre... I was there...
Well, what a coincidence!
Fly!
Hey!
I'll be fighting you.
Didn't you get caught in Romalia?!
You think there's a dungeon that can hold me?
But let me tell you, I didn't enjoy being forced
to eat their stinking dungeon food.
I'll be taking out my anger on you!
Hey, what are you doing to my mansion?!
Valkyrie!
Saito, are you okay?
Let me handle that muscle brain!
Would you care to find out if my brain's really all muscle?
I-I would!
He looks awfully strong!
Yeah.
What's all the racket?
M-Miss Valliere!
What?!
Good morning.
It's good to see you again.
You!
Looking for this?
Windy Icicle!
Hardening magic...
Fighting you is more fun than I expected!
Go!
Saito, help!
Louise!
You're so cute when you're struggling.
No! Stop!
Are you okay, Louise?
Help me, Saito!
She's strange! There's something not right with her!
I think I'm going to make this girl into a doll.
Is that okay?
Of course not!
Come closer, and she loses her cute negligee.
Y-You think you can threaten me with that?
Stop!
Why?
I don't want anyone else to see!
I feel the same way, but...
Well, I'm taking it off.
Stop it!
What the hell are you doing?!
Um, Siesta...
Miss Westwood!
You're safe!
What's happening?
I'm not sure. These strange people came out of nowhere.
What are they doing?
They're probably fighting because they're hungry.
That's barbarians for you. No better than beasts.
Hey, isn't that her?
It's too dangerous!
But I might be able to stop the fight
with my Mind Wipe spell.
This is truly the working of a great consciousness.
That was too easy.
What's going on here, Jacques?
D-Damian...
This is just...
How should I say it?
Doudou was saying he
wanted to fight that Sai-something guy again...
And so I...
So you tagged along to get some revenge, huh?
Of course Jeanette is being Jeanette.
But I don't believe in doing things that
don't make me money.
I'm going to end this right here.
My older brother Damian?
This is...
Wh-Where did the water come from?!
It's alchemy.
It completely changes the properties of matter.
Damian...
So you had to come.
I've had enough of your games!
Oh, not bad.
That was Siesta!
Saito, go!
Okay!
Elves?
Half-elf daughter, you will come with us.
M-Me?
She does look like an elf.
But those are too big for an elf.
Stop!
I don't know whose magic this is, but I'm going to use it.
Precious water of life, grant them a peaceful sleep.
Wh-What is this? I feel slee
Hey, pal! Snap out of it!
Hey!
Let's take them with us.
Yes.
I knew it.
He is the protector of the demon.
You know, the one who defeated our uncle.
What?!
I would have never expected to see elves here.
The world is spinning out of control indeed.
No.
I suppose I should say that the Void is changing the world.
Th-This is really bad!
Huh?
Where am I?
Huh?
What is this?
Th-This is a happiness producer!
S-Saito...
T-Tiffa?
I'm so sorry!
Touching them just felt so good that I...
No... It's not a big deal.
Where do you think we are?
Wait, those clothes...
This is elf garb!
My mother had something similar.
That's right. There were elves and then...
Oh.
You're up?
I was worried that maybe Ari's magic had been too potent.
You're an elf, aren't you?
That's right.
My name is Lukshana.
It's nice to meet you.
What is this place?
This?
This is our country.
This is Nephthys.
And this is my oasis.
But what are we doing here?
Isn't it obvious?
We kidnapped you two.
Tabitha's familiar Sylphid saw everything.
It is certain that the elves have kidnapped Tiffa and Saito!
A week has passed,
but you're saying Tristain can't send any help?
Romalia has asked that we leave this to them.
His Holiness asked this?
We are not very familiar with the elves.
Romalia has been studying them for many years.
They are much more suited for this.
But...
Please understand, Louise.
I understand.
Then, if you will excuse me.
Louise...
What happened?
You came...
We couldn't just sit at the academy and wait for the news.
So when is the rescue party leaving?
The Order of the Undine Knights is volunteering!
Tristain is not going to send help.
Apparently we're to leave it to Romalia.
Huh?
But he's the hero of this country!
They still won't help him?
Our hands are tied against the elves.
We had all those mages there, yet still we were
powerless to stop the kidnapping.
I'm sure Romalia will do something.
I'm going back to the mansion.
Louise...
Miss Valliere!
Are they sending the rescue forces?
Please leave me alone.
Saito... Saito...
Saito has always saved me.
Now it's my turn to save him.
Even if I have to do it alone.
The ancestral prayer book...
I'm actually a scientist studying the barbarian culture.
I asked for permission to keep you here for my research.
That's why both of you were able to come here.
Stop making it sound like you did us a favor.
And why did you kidnap us in the first place?
Because this girl wields the power of a demon.
A demon?
Excuse me. I suppose you barbarians call it a...
Void Mage?
Plus, you're the familiar Gandalbrr.
It's Gandalfr!
And since you are a weak soul and don't have a familiar,
you were the perfect target.
Weak soul...
The higher-ups of this country are afraid that
the four demon users will get together.
They say that power could be used to invade this country.
We just took you because we could.
It was Ari's idea to kidnap you.
They said you were strong enough to defeat our uncle,
so it was best if we took you, too.
Your uncle?
But now it's my turn to ask!
What kind of food do you eat?
And why do you believe in this devil called Brimir?
And how do you get a chest like that?
Huh? That's...
Uncle!
Lukshana.
Is there any news?
Yes!
The barbarian world was very interesting.
Look. It's that half-elf and the barbarian.
It's been a while, barbarian warrior.
Bidalsha...
Don't worry.
I'm only here to check if my niece
is properly doing her job in keeping you here.
This time.
Lukshana, I'm going to check
the mansion to see if everything is all right.
Go ahead, uncle!
You'll find everything in perfect order.
Whatever happened to that Gallian girl's mother?
The last I heard, Tabitha's mother had recovered.
I see.
So you're saying our resting place
is now the barbarian's kennel?
Stop pouting.
Anyway, what did the council say?
Well...
There is no reason to let the demon users
and their familiars live!
The moderate faction rejected the
military party's proposal that Eshmael delivered.
Right now the council is split right down the middle.
But this time, I have to say I agree with Eshmael.
A barbarian is no more than a beast.
Who knows what will happen if we let them live?
Ari!
If you keep saying things like that, I won't marry you.
But that's something completely different!
Can't you be more supportive of my research?
Miss Valliere?
Siesta.
You're going to the land of the elves, aren't you?
Please take me with you!
I can't!
It's a very dangerous place, you know.
I can't doom you with me.
I also can't just sit here and wait.
But, Siesta...
Even if I can't help, I want to be close to Saito!
Please.
Fine.
Then the two of us will go together.
The three of us.
Tabitha! I thought you went back to Gallia!
I changed my mind.
I'm going, too.
B-But...
Sylphid is here, so we can fly there.
Should be faster than riding horses.
Then let's go, all three of us!
How long does it take to get to the elf country?
With Sylphid's speed, we'll get there in four days.
But we can't take any rests.
I see. That's a lot further than I thought.
Huh? What's that sound?
Look!
It's the Ostland...
Jeez, Louise, what are you trying to pull?
You know, even Sylphid is going to get tired.
Join us and let us head for the elf country together!
Everyone, thank you.
Just you wait, Saito!
We're all coming for you!
I guess this really isn't going to work.
It looks like they've cast some spells
to make sure we can't run away.
I'm very sorry, Saito. This is all my fault.
But this isn't your fault at all.
They caught me because I'm so weak,
and you got caught up in the whole thing.
Do you want to go back to Tristain, Tiffa?
Huh?
Yes, I do!
Me, too.
So let's go back together.
Right now, that's all we need.
Okay!
Saito?
We can work out all the details later.
Right now, let's just have some fun.
Come on in, Tiffa!
Saito!
I'm so glad he's here.
The things barbarians do might not be so different
from what we do, after all.
Isn't that right, Mr. Talking Sword?
Huh?
Tiffa?
Hey!
Tiffa, don't scare me like that!
I'm sorry! I didn't...
It's all right!
You're my friend. I don't mind.
You're right, we are friends, but still...
It's fine! If you want, you can even touch them.
After all, we're just friends.
No, I don't think that's a good idea!
What is it?
Wait right here.
This is from my world...
Saito, I do hope you're safe.
I'm going all the way to that desert to save you!
Next time: Escape Through the Sewer.
You think you can do that with Tiffa
Escape Through the Sewer
and get away with it?!
You stupid mutt!
