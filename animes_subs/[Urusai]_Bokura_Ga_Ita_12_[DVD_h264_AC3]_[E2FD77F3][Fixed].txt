Well, you might think number three's the weirdest one.
Oh, enough already.
Three. Yamamoto and I had sex.
Yeah, nothing but weird ones.
It's weird, isn't it?
It's so stupid.
I'm surprised you could think up something that weird...
Yeah.
Especially that third one... Even if you were just joking, that's just sick.
Yeah. It is sick.
No matter what happened...
I'll accept it.

Why can't things go well between
the liar, you, and the crybaby, me?
You don't notice my styled hair
or my nice set of press-on nails.
Love isn't about the unhappy tears that go along with it.
Those tears only leave my eyes dry and hurt me.
I love this destiny
between only you and only me.
I want to accept your hot feelings
and be taken by you forever.
Despite your uncute, tearful face and your shortness, I still love you.
Episode 12 ...
It's already been three days since I last spoke to Yano.
Yamamoto and I had sex.
I know Yano was hiding it because he was being kind, not because he was being fair.
But... she's Nana-san's little sister.
Were you lonely?
Or did you just see Nana-san in her?
Either way...
Whoa, Yano couldn't make a single basket.
No way, that's so unusual.
Oh, the boys are being tested right now.
Ah, goddamn it.
My record of making all five shots since I was in 4th grade...
It's easy to tell when you've got something on your mind.
It's a good thing you're not going to be a pro athlete.
That's fine, since I'm going to become a romance novelist.
Even with your B- essays?
That's out of the question.
I'll use my own story as the plot. I'll have a ton of material.
Am I a moron?
Maybe a little. You can be unexpectedly clumsy sometimes.
But I guess that'd be a compliment for a guy, huh?
It sounds a hundred times better than saying you're graceful.
But I can't really approve of that.
You're just a moron.
No matter how much I call her cellphone, she won't pick up.
She won't even look at me.
Keep calling her.
I've already called her fifty times.
Then call her a hundred times.
I'll be right there!
My.
Oh, my. Oh, my.
Tell him I'm asleep!
Even after he's come all the way out here?
I don't care! I don't want to see him right now!
I'm really sorry. Nanami's in the bath right now...
Don't tell him I'm in the bath! Tell him I'm asleep!
If I spoke with him now, I'd only be able to say cruel things.
I'll wait.
Umm... I understand how you feel, but... I think it might be best to leave her alone right now.
Sometimes it's easier to talk about things after everyone's calmed down a little.
By tomorrow, I'm sure Nanami will-
Can you really guarantee that things will be better by tomorrow?
I understand.
Please give those to her.
Oh my, oh my!
What beautiful flowers!
Please tell her I'll see you tomorrow at school for me.
Be careful on your way home!
Aren't these flowers wonderful?
Even after he came all this way to give you these...
I've raised an ogre as a daughter. Really.
D-Does he really think flowers will make everything better?
Who would fall for something like that?
Don't mess with me, you jerk!
Sometimes you really don't deserve him.
That man I don't deserve had sex with his ex-girlfriend's little sister.
But aren't the flowers splendid?
I wonder if his mother went through a lot of effort getting them to grow this beautifully?
Look at all of these roses.
You moron.
You moron...
You big moron...
This is so dumb...
They smell really good.
I'm sure he picked them all from his garden in a rush and wrapped them in a newspaper without thinking...
I wonder if he really rode a bus carrying this huge bouquet with him...
I wish I could rewrite my past.
If I could, I'd do all I could...
He's got me...
I'm going out for a bit!
Where are you going at this time of night?
To the bus stop!
You're not fair!
You're really not fair at all!
But...
But Yano...
Yano!
I really wanted to tell him off, but...
I love you, you big moron!
Ah... I'm too soft...
I might not've been able to forgive him.
But when I see his face, I feel like I don't have any choice.
It's frustrating, but I still want to be beside him.
Like they say, you'll always give in to the other when you're in love...
Yeah.
Mizu-chin once told me I wouldn't be able to beat someone who's dead.
But I can't change his past.
So shouldn't I try to make the present as happy as possible?
Don't you think so?
Yeah.
Yano hates Nana-san.
I don't want to speak badly of the dead...
But... Nana-san's not fair.
That's why I'm going to make Yano happy.
I must sound pretty dumb, huh?
No, that's great.
Could I warn you of something, though?
Yeah.
If it's just going to be a relationship of hardship and mental agony, you should put an end to it.
Why...?
We're going to be happy...
Where should we go on Sunday?
Ah, how about the zoo?
When I suggested the zoo before, you made fun of me!
Come on. Let's go see the monkeys!
I'm not in the mood for monkeys.
Then what are you in the mood for?
The beach!
No?
It's not that...
Girls really love the beach, huh?
I know of a beach near here that's not like the ones you see in pictures. Is that all right?
Yeah.
Then let's go to the beach.
If people could do things over, I wonder if they...
Check out this kelp!
Ah, stop it!
See, see?
Would they choose the people they encounter...
The sea's shining... it's so pretty.
I'm glad.
Aren't you glad we came?
Yes, yes. I'm glad. I'm glad.
Sheesh.
There's no one around.
We could probably do it over there if we used that as a bed.
Ow.
If they only picked the things that made them happy...
Let's collect seashells!
I brought a jar with me.
What about this one?
Only the pretty-looking ones.
See? That one isn't.
What are you gonna do after collecting these?
Make them into a memory.
Takahashi, can I say something?
I can see your panties.
There aren't any cherry petal shells, huh?
Cherry petal shells?
You know, the pink ones.
Don't you think we'd have to go a little further south to find nice ones like that?
Ah, what about this one?
What?
You tickled me.
How?
What do you mean, how?
Takahashi, it's just a sea slater!
No, no!
No, no, no, no!
It won't bite. Don't wor-
Ah! A bug! Over here, too!
Gross, gross!
Let's go back! Let's go back!
Yano?
I'm sorry. I made too much of a fuss.
Let's go back.
But we just got here.
You hate bugs, don't you?
Not really...
It just surprised me a little...
Who are you... confusing me with?
Let's forget about...
Nana-san's not fair.
She lied to you, betrayed you, and left you all alone.
It makes sense for you to get angry.
You're right to hold a grudge.
You must want to complain to her, but you can't.
Because Nana-san's dead! She's no longer here!
Tell me here, now, Yano.
Tell you what?
Everything you've wanted to say. All about your grudge, or whatever.
There's nothing like that left.
That can't be true.
There has to be something you've wanted to say to her.
Oh, shush already. There's nothing.
It pisses me off.
You big idiot.
Drop dead.
I'll listen to everything you have to say.
If Nana-san were here, what would you say?
If Nana-san...
I promise.
Hey, you guys are in the same class as Yuri, right?
I'm sorry, but could you lend me some cash?
He left without paying.
They call that sort of thing being blind.
You haven't really fallen in love with anyone before.
They call people like you immature know-it-alls.
Hurry and really fall in love.
Do you still think he's gonna come?
He won't.
Then why are you waiting around?
To gather my rage.
That's not a hand warmer. It's a drink.
Hey... what do you think I should do?
What? Figure out your own problems yourself.
Because I'm a moron, I don't know!
I could tell you, but in exchange, you better do as I say.
Will it make me happy?
What's happiness?
I don't know.
Probably something where no one cries or gets yelled at.
Where no one gets hit or has stuff thrown at them.
Something like that.
Am I wrong?
I don't know.
What's up with that!
Then... why don't we both go searching for our own happiness?
If you saw her now, what would you tell her?
Tell me what you're feeling.
You're... a liar.
What you're saying and what you're doing are contradictory.
I promise I won't betray you.
That you absolutely won't betray me.
Yeah.
There's no second chance.
I promise.
Yano!
How can I hate...
Ya...
Everything...
I'll forgive you for everything.
So, please... I want you to come back to me alive.
Come back to life...
That's why I'm going to make Yano happy.
That's why... we need to make my past pale in comparison to our present.
I swear it on the stars.
If there's a shooting star, I wish to be with Nana-chan forever.
I love you.
You liar...
You liar...
You liar...
You liar...
Yano...
I can't make you happy.
I'm sorry for not being able to keep our promise...
Yano made his wish long ago...
Takahashi...
Nana-chan.
Nana.
Nana...
Unless he hated her... Yano seems like he'd be crushed by all of the sadness...
That was his way to protect himself...
Give me a promise.
Promise me that you'll never leave my side.
I wonder why people... make promises they won't be able to keep...
Who betrayed who?
Yuri-chan.
I was dumped.
Are you satisfied?
You said serves you right before as well, didn't you?
Takahashi-san's pretty gutless, huh? I didn't expect that.
Do you want me to comfort you again?
As if I'll ever fall for that again.
Everyone was dreaming...

I feel like the seasons have changed slightly
and the sunbeams have thinned and will one day shift.
But I was relieved, knowing our bus
was riding through...
The sunset stretches my shadow long and thin.
Its colors deeply dye my heart.
When you said this was probably the last time,
I held back my tears.
Memories are always too sad.
I just want to forget them all.
I continued to watch the last sunset
and your back that I would never see again.
You were always too kind.
And even though it's too late now...
Stop the sunset. I don't want to lose you.
Like the sky enveloping me,
your face would always look down at me.
Make it so the sun never sets...
The room we always lived in, that photograph when we walked on the beach...
The promise we made will go unkept.
I became so lonely alone in my room, listening to the distant rain.
One day...
I felt as if I heard you calling out for me.
Without thinking, I looked around.
It was just the wind pulling a prank on me.
There's no one on the hill.
The sky's the same color
as on the day when we broke up.
One day, the seasons will change again,
Even though flowers are blooming on the hill.
Those days of love
will never return.
It's all a dream now.
The bright sunbeams glint off the distant houses and stores.
My small things are
already crossing over the bridge.
It's such a gentle city,
But right now, it's painful to me.
When we were both in love with each other,
it was just too beautiful.
Those days still live on in my heart,
but I don't know what to do from now on.
Those days of love
will never return.
It's all a dream now.
Those days of love
will never return.
Those days of love
will never return.
It's all a dream now.
Episode 13 Preview...
I regret what I did so much that I want to die.
Back then... back at that place... those actions I took...
Everything I choose is always wrong.
But I want you to listen to me...
What I told you this morning was my final notice.
Didn't I tell you that you'd regret it?
Sorry!
I can't hold back anymore!
