Unforgivable! He is the number one enemy of all junior high girls!
Impure fraternization! It's just unforgivable!
For the crime of staining everyone's favorite hangout with evil...
In the name of the moon, Sailor Moon will punish you!
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward, I can say it in my dreams
My thoughts are about to short circuit, I want to see you right now
Moonlight that makes me want to cry, midnight that keeps me from calling
Because I'm so innocent, what should I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope
Guided by the light of the moon
We will meet again and again
I count the sparkle of constellations to foretell the future of my love
We were born in the same land, miracle romance
I believe in it, miracle romance
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like a super heroine, but I am!
As you know, I transform myself by using a peculiar brooch
and fight against bad guys.
I'm the sailor warrior of love and justice, Sailor Moon!
And my friends are the smart and sweet Ami Mizuno,
and a slightly quick-tempered psychic girl, Rei Hino.
Both of them are so dependable, I feel like I'll fall behind.
But anyway, I just have to do my best!
Usagi is Frantic! Rei's First Date
It's a nice and quiet place.
Yup! Perfect for a date!
So, do you like it?
I'm a bit surprised you know of a place like this.
Really? I always come here to read
when I don't have cram school.
Mr. Kunitachi.
Oh, Ami.
So, you take care of this big park all by yourself?
Well, that will be coming to an end soon.
What?
The land owner sold this park,
and it's apparently being turned into a business district.
I had no idea.
When this park is gone, the birds and animals will have nowhere to go.
It's troubling.
And it's such a nice park, too.
Well, there is nothing I can do about it.
All right! I'm going to bring a boyfriend here before it's gone.
Jubancho Shopping District
Where has everyone gone today?!
Are you okay?
You don't look hurt.
What are you doing to my Luna?!
If she's your cat, keep a better eye on her!
She almost got run over!
None of your business!
Luna isn't like your everyday ordinary cat!
Stop it, Usagi.
That's right. He saved Luna, so you should thank him.
Yeah, yeah. That's right. He saved Luna, so you should thank him.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Why are you both taking his side?!
Why are you both taking his side?!
Hey.
It's you, Chiba.
Yo, Motoki. It's you, Chiba.
Yo, Motoki.
Motoki...
You know him?
Yeah, we both go to the same college.
You're...
The stars know everything.
O stars, grant me your mysterious powers.
The beta star of Cygnus, Albireo,
is noticeably brighter again after 120 years.
So, this is the man who will be influenced by Albireo
and reach his peak energy level.
I shall take the greatest energy of his life from him.
Shoot! Okay, another 100 yen!
Are you sure it's okay to waste so much money?
Oh, don't worry about it. Are you sure it's okay to waste so much money?
Oh, don't worry about it.
Wow. So, Mamoru lives by himself?
Yeah, in an expensive high-rise apartment.
After all, he is the son of a rich family.
If he goes to the same college as you,
he goes to that really competitive school, right?
Yeah, I suppose.
But, Rei, why are you asking so much about him?
Oh, no reason!
Mamoru Chiba. He and I would be a perfect match for each other.
I've decided!
I will go on a date with Mamoru in that park!
Okay, this'll be the last time!
Are you okay, Rei?
I'm done for! Are you okay, Rei?
I'm done for!
I wish there was some way to protect this nature.
You will protect it.
What?
Who are you?
People have forgotten the boon that nature bestows upon them.
It is time for you to teach those conceited humans the wrath of nature.
Me?
That's right.
You.
My loyal monster,
possess this hat and take this man's energy!
You will teach the humans the wrath of nature. You.
What are these?! Help!
By using the power of the monster,
you can control the animals and insects at will.
The more you use that power, the more your energy will increase.
According to what Motoki told me,
he's supposed to come this way after school.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't looking where I was going.
Not at all. I should have paid more attention, too.
If you don't mind, I'll take you out for tea as an apology.
My! All right, I will join you.
Good.
Oh, it would be nice.
For cake or bread, come to our shop! Juban Bakery Oh, it would be nice.
For cake or bread, come to our shop! Juban Bakery
For cake or bread, come to our shop! Juban Bakery I'll bump into him on purpose and make an opportunity for myself!
Sheesh! You're going to gain weight again!
This is nothing!
Oh, it's Rei!
You're right. I wonder what she's doing?
Here he comes.
Now!
Are you okay?!
I don't know what she was doing,
but Rei's pretty clumsy.
Speak for yourself.
I'm all right.
Okay, glad to hear it.
What?!
Excuse me...
Oh? You're that dumpling head's friend.
Yes. My name is Rei Hino. Please just call me, Rei.
Are you okay?
Sure, I'm fine, but...
I'm sorry. I will take you out for tea to make up for this.
To make up for what?
Oh, well...
For making you step on my head.
What?
Well, okay. I won't mind having tea with you.
Really?!
Yeah. Really?!
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, everything turned out okay in the end.
Well, everything turned out okay in the end.
What the hell is he doing?!
He's a college student and he's walking arm-in-arm with Rei!
Usagi, I don't think Mamoru is such a bad person, you know.
Don't be silly! That's impure fraternization!
Even the student guide says that's absolutely wrong!
Anyway, Rei's in danger! We're following them!
Sheesh. She's just jealous, plain and simple.
Excuse me...
Would you like some sugar?
No thanks, I'm fine. Would you like some sugar?
No thanks, I'm fine.
Oh, of course not!
Then I won't either.
I wonder what they're talking about?
I wish I could go in.
It's your fault for spending all your money on ice cream.
I know! I'll transform into a waitress and...
No, you can't!
Why not?
Because you're supposed to use that for justice! Why not?
Because you're supposed to use that for justice!
Oh, come on! Just for a little while!
Miss Usagi! Oh, come on! Just for a little while!
Miss Usagi!
What are you doing?
Umino...
Umino, do you have any money on you?
Yes, I do...
Then how about going on a date with me right now?
What?! Really?!
I can't keep up with the way she thinks.
Mamoru, I know of a really nice place.
Would you like to go there with me?
Sure, I don't mind.
Really?!
Everything is going according to plan.
Shoot! I can't hear them from here either.
Ami.
Luna!
What's wrong? You don't look very cheerful.
Yeah...
Well...
It seems the construction company
that was working on the park just left.
As a result, the park will stay as it is for now.
So, we would like you to continue to be the park's caretaker.
What? The caretaker of this park?
Yes. He was the same until yesterday, but...
You should not come to this park without good reason from now on.
You people don't deserve to enjoy the boons of nature.
I wonder what happened to him?
That construction company is pitiful!
There's no way animals and insects would interfere with the construction!
What?! What are these?!
What's going on?
I'll never do anything to this park again! Forgive me!
This place is filled with a powerful evil aura!
What?!
This must be the work of the Dark Kingdom! What?!
This must be the work of the Dark Kingdom!
Oh, no.
Then Mr. Kunitachi could also be...
I didn't know there was a park like this in this city.
But this park is going to be torn down soon.
I heard they're turning it into a business district.
I see.
It's such a nice park surrounded by beautiful nature.
You think so too, Mamoru?
Yes. People should think about taking better care of nature.
Mamoru...
What could they be chatting about?!
I'll just have to get closer to them.
Usagi, you're too bold.
This is not the place for...
We should have a pure relationship, like good junior high kids.
But maybe a kiss wouldn't hurt!
Huh? Where did you go, Miss Usagi?!
Usagi!
Oh, so you're both here, too.
We can't leave those two alone after all.
Don't be ridiculous!
Usagi, something terrible is going on in this park right now!
Something terrible?
You guys again! Something terrible?
You guys again!
Mr. Kunitachi!
Foolish humans! Mr. Kunitachi!
Foolish humans!
You people forgot the boon that nature provided you with,
and the only way you can atone for it is with your deaths!
The energy level has peaked!
Do it, Petasos!
Mr. Kunitachi...
All animals in this park, massacre the humans!
Unforgivable! Mercury Power Makeup!
Usagi, don't just stand there!
I know that!
Moon Prism Power Makeup!
Mamoru, what is wrong?
What's this?!
What are these?!
Oh, help me!
Bubble
Spray!
The animals have been weakened!
Prepare yourself!
Mercury's on a roll!
Then I will use... Hand Flower!
Watch out!
Sailor Moon!
Petasos Rope!
Are you okay?
Yes, I am. But you weren't feeling well...
Oh, it was nothing serious.
All right.
I sense a powerful evil aura.
Mamoru, stay here! I'll be right back!
Sailor Mercury!
I will squeeze you to death first.
Mr. Kunitachi...
I can't forgive you!
I can't forgive you!
Fire Soul!
Hot! Hot! Hot!
Are you okay?
Can't you help me in a better way? Are you okay?
Can't you help me in a better way?
Is that any way to talk to someone who just rescued you?!
I see. So, she's the one who interrupted my date.
I can't forgive you for taking advantage of Mr. Kunitachi's feelings!
You'll pay a heavy price for staining everyone's favorite hangout with evil.
In the name of the moon, we will punish you!
Hey, that's my line!
Fine, then! I'll take care of all three of you together!
Tuxedo Mask!
Now's your chance, Sailor Moon!
Yes!
Moon Tiara Action!
Good-bye, sailor warriors!
He's so dreamy.
Ami, what have I been doing?
It's okay now. Don't worry. You were just having a bad dream.
Good grief. That was awful.
Mamoru! Is it okay for you to get up?
Yeah, I'm completely fine now.
Maybe Mamoru really is Tuxedo Mask.
There's no way this guy can be Tuxedo Mask!
Huh? What's this Tuxedo Mask?
Oh, no, it's nothing at all.
He has to be! Mamoru is surely Tuxedo Mask.
Oh, Miss Usagi!
Oh, Umino...
I looked everywhere for you.
Now, let us continue our date.
Umino, don't go making up stories!
What are you talking about? You're the one who asked me out!
Really? Good going.
That's not it!
I'm telling you, it's not!
In my dream, you and I were together
Protected by the stars
When we were friends, it didn't bother us
And we casually talked to each other
But there was a moment when I noticed only you
I want to become prettier right here and now
Something changes when you fall in love
I close my eyes and check to make sure
I want to convey the thrill I felt when we held each other
