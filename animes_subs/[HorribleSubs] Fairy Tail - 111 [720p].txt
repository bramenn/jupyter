The battle with Grimoire Heart continues on the guild's sacred ground, Tenroujima.
With Gramps down and out,
the rest of us are in desperate battles with the Lost Magic using 7 Kin of Purgatory!
Furthermore, it's looking like the second in command, Bluenote, is drawing near...
During all this, a woman the spitting image of Ul appeared in front of me...
Juvia and Gray-sama were enemies when they first met,
however fickle fate drew them near!
Juvia chased after Gray-sama and fought together with him at the Tower of Heaven,
One day, she'll be linked for eternity with Gray-sama...
Tears of Love and Vigor!
Juvia, Gray, and my senses are all linked together.
Now, no matter which one of us dies, Gray will die.
Craziness...
That means that you'd die as well!
That's right.
This is my conviction!
It's over.
The three of us can do nothing but die.
What is this pain?
And my feet are cold!
Someone's senses are flowing into me.
Is this what's doing it?
When did I get stuck with it?
Damn it...
I'm going to lose sight of them because of this!
Something seems to be pressing against my back?
Gray-sama's sense of touch, perhaps?
He's leaning his back against something.
Now that I am linked with Gray, I have no need to fight anyone, anymore!
All I need to do is kill myself.
Don't!
I am not afraid of death!
Gray-sama, I'm sorry!
You... Your own leg?
Maguilty sense will link the pain, but it can't link the injury itself...
The only way to stop me is to kill me!
But the one special exception to this magic is that death itself is linked.
The lives of those that have been linked are one.
And yet, you still plan on fighting it?!
The only path we three have left is to die...
There is another way.
All three of us can live!
Even when defeating our opponents, Fairy Tail wizards do not take their lives!
Naive fool!
I am going to kill Gray for Ultear's sake!
Not as long as Juvia is here!
You'll be out of commission soon enough!
It'll be all right...
Please stop crying.
What's with the kid?
She's a survivor.
Then we should crush her.
I'll look after her.
What are you talking about?
We were ordered to wipe out all the people in the land where Zeref's key is sleeping.
It'll be okay.
This girl can get close to the depths of magic.
Ul, why do you always seem lonely?
I told you, don't call me Ul.
Ul is my mother... My dead mother's name.
She's dead?
I'll tell you about it, one day.
You're my mother, Ultear.
I don't need such a big girl as my daughter.
What... is this?
Why?
Why are you crying?
You have happiness, too!
You have people precious to you, too!
Impossible...
It's not just our senses that are linked, but our emotions, too?
Live...
But that's...
Juvia... will live, too.
Juvia will live for the people she loves!
You're the same!
If you have love, you've got to keep on living!
Love?
No...
Live...
If I link my emotions any more with this woman...
The tears of love and vigor...
These feelings are...
I cannot fight you.
Gray-sama will never run, nor hide.
The senses that were connected to me have disappeared.
As well as the mark on my arm.
Tears?
Damn it!
What happened?
Where is she?
Crap!
Following me?
Who are you?
You've noticed already, yes?
I am Ultear, the daughter of your teacher, Ul.
She is Ul's daughter?
She and Jellal betrayed the Magic Council, and actually belonged to Grimoire Heart!
I see.
I bet you hate my guts, don't you?
Gray...
I've wanted to see you for so long...
Don't worry.
I'm on your side, see.
Ta-da!
How cute!
Clothes from the Spirit World. You look splendid, Princess.
Thanks, Virgo!
In addition...
You have some for me, too?
Please, change your clothes.
You will catch cold.
Thanks...
If you would like, shall I assist you?
No, I'm fine! I'll change myself!
The rain isn't stopping, is it?
I hope Carla and Lily are okay...
Carla!
Where's Lily?
We found our camp along the way.
Gajeel and Mira are in critical condition.
Lily said he was stopping there.
I hope they're all okay.
Yes.
Grimoire Heart's ship is beyond there, by the eastern shore.
Our camp, huh?
Hey, do you think we should head there?
Cana might be there as well.
That's true.
I think it'd be for the best for us all to join together.
Right. Let's go.
I'll take Gramps.
Stop the Magic Council.
We'll do something about Grimoire Heart and Zeref, don't worry.
Just stop them from attacking the island, please!
Not a chance...
Fine, then buy us some time, at least.
Countin' on you.
No, that's not what I meant!
I want to know exactly how you're going to manage to overcome this!
By going all out.
That's it!
My ally?
That's right.
But, I...
I know. You don't have to say it.
Ul's death was not your fault.
My mother was only protecting her pupils.
I think of it with pride.
Don't lie to me.
I don't really care what you think of me.
But I can't think Ul would be proud of what you're doing!
About Zeref?
That's right!
Deliora was the reason that Ul gave up her life!
And it was Zeref who created that thing, right?!
You guys are going to use Zeref to create some nutty world that makes no sense!
You're wrong, Gray...
About what?!
What I'm trying to do is what my mother...
Wendy! Where are you?
Erza Scarlet.
Who goes there?!
So we finally meet...
One with true strength, Titania.
That girl? I finished her off.
What?!
Even Meldy has been defeated... Incredible.
I never imagined that over half of the 7 Kin of Purgatory would be cut down.
Bluenote...
My, oh my...
Am I too late?
Blue
I apologize, Makarov.
He's the only one I didn't want to use...
It ends.
Natsu and the others are coming here?
With Lu-chan and Wendy, right?
Indeed!
Unless something has happened, Carla should be leading them here.
Thank goodness...
We have a lot of injured here.
If we were attacked by the enemy, we'd be in trouble!
They should also be bringing the wounded Master here.
They even got the Master...
Levy...
I know!
We're never going to give up!
As long as we all work together, I'm sure...
Giving up is important, too!
In this world we live in,
there is something called an insurmountable difference in strength.
My fragment... it's shaking in excitement...
Devouring all the fairies, not leaving a single one left!
This is bad...
Can I support myself in battle mode?
Me, Levy, Lily too...
We've all reached the limits of our magic power!
Hurry up and get here, Natsu!
Dranbalt-san... Will he be okay?
Just leave that guy.
I'm worried about Cana as well.
Where did we get separated?
I hope she's at the camp.
Someone's there.
What is this magic power?!
Why is it raining so hard only near him?!
My skin is all tingly...
Who the hell are you?!
Can you fly?
No, not yet.
Fall.
I can't move!
Gravity?!
What was that?
Amazing magic power!
There's a monster even worse than him?!
Great, the annoying one has arrived.
Going to interrupt my meal, are we?
Who is that?
Bluenote has arrived, it seems.
This war is over, I suppose.
This island will be left lifeless.
Look here.
I don't really care about Fairy Tail, or Zeref...
But there is one thing here that I want.
Where is the grave of Fairy Tail's founding Master, Mavis Vermilion?
Mavis's grave is before me...
I can finally become S class!
I can finally meet my father!
What is this?
The grave is... shining!
Natsu, I need to tell you something.
Oh, what's up?
You see, I have a secret that I've never told you, Natsu.
What's that?
Promise me you won't get mad?
S-Sure...
Um, you see... I actually...
You really won't get mad?
Hurry up and spit it out!
See, you got angry!
Next time: The Words Couldn't Say.
That's'cause you wouldn't say it.
It's a secret because it's something I can't tell people!
Then why did you bring it up in the first place?
