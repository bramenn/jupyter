Stay with it, Kuririn... Gohan can't control this Ki...
T- t- there it is! Is this-?
A Genki Dama... You did it...
Hit him... with that...
I can't make another Genki Dama... Make sure you hit him... please!
Y- you got it! I'll try. Let me take care of it.
He's so strong! He should be fairly worn out from fighting with Father, too...
You're a tough little runt, but you appear to be nearing your limit.
Gohan- chan, fight!
Fight, Gohan- chan!
W- w- what are you sayin', Chichi!? Gohan's no match for that guy!
Gohan, get out of there!
Gohan-chan...
Chichi, are you-?
Chichi...
They've vanished!
Gohan- chan?
Uranai Baba, hurry up and show me Gohan- chan!
A- all right! All right! I'll try! Let me go!
You've got a ridiculous amount of strength for a woman!
Kamehame-Ha!!
Is that your last-ditch effort!?
Darn it!
One more!
Damn! With my skill, I can't hit him when he's moving around like that!
You don't hit him with the Genki Dama by using your eyes.
You sense out his evil Ki and shoot at that.
W- who's there!?
I am Kaio, the one who taught Son Goku the Genki Dama.
K- Kaio- sama?
Everything will be decided by your one shot.
Know that the ball of that Genki Dama is filled with the hopes of the whole earth.
The ball is filled with the hopes of the whole earth?
No matter how many of you scum gang up on me, you're still no match for an elite.
It looks like once you realized that, it was already too late.
S- sense out his evil Ki and shoot at that... So that's it...
Kuririn, we're counting on you!
You'll only get one chance.
I'm done playing around.
You think you can get away!?
F - feel it! Feel his evil Ki!
K - Kuririn!
H - he's fixin' to do somethin'. That's a humungous amount of Ki.
lf you're gonna get him, then get him, already!
Watch closely, Kakarrot! This is the end of your foolish son!
I've got him!
What're ya doin', ya dimwit!? Hurry up and hit him with that!
W - what?
T- that idiot!
Damn it all!
W- what is that!?
Hit him!
It missed!
W- what happened!? How could my crystal ball crack!?
G- Gohan- chan!
It's hopeless now!
Bounce it back, Gohan!
Gohan, that thing is on our side!
As long as you don't have any evil in you, you should be able to bounce it back!
You did it!
Yahoo!
We did it!
We did it!
We did it, Goku!
Turtle, do you have any quick-drying glue?
Glue? Hmm, I seem to remember having some around here somewhere...
What about Gohan- chan!?
Uranai Baba, can't you do something about the crystal ball!?
Chichi! Stop that!
Y- you're right. But how are we goin' to get to where Goku and them are?
All right, Chichi- san, I'll take you there.
Really? But how?
In my airship.
Bulma- san, thank you!
If I were to ever have a husband and son who were in trouble,
I would rush to their side, no matter what. That's human nature.
All right, I'm going too.
I'm going, too.
K- Karin- sama!
Father...
You guys finally got him, huh?
Time and again, I thought we were done for.
You two sure are a mess.
We're not as bad off as you.
T- the Saiyan!
It's okay. He's dead.
We can relax, now.
Damn it all, he was one horrible fellow, but we could at least dig a grave.
You mean, a grave for you guys?
T- t- that's impossible! He took that Genki Dama dead-on!
You put me through quite the awful experience, huh?
E- even I thought I was going to die from that one.
I may have taken quite a bit of damage,
but I still have enough power left to take care of you trash.
After I've killed you,
I'll wait until I've recovered my strength, and then thoroughly destroy this planet!
Just keep on going straight.
Bulma! For Karin- sama to deign to give you directions...
It is? He looks like an ordinary cat to me.
Y- you guys dare to make me, Vegeta- sama, use up nearly all of my power?
Never mind that you ganged up on me, against trash like you, it wounds my pride...
Would you die, already!?
D- dammit... Dammit!
G- Goku!
Damn it! Coming from me, that destructive force was pathetic!
All three of them are still barely alive!
I- I've taken more damage than I thought... I- I have to put them all away quickly...
T- this brat has...
H- his tail? That's right... In the past, Goku's tail suddenly grew back, too...
If he were to transform, that would be a problem!
Gohan's tail has once again grown out.
Could this be a symbol that the fate of the earth -
that the fate of mankind - is to be saved from extinction?
