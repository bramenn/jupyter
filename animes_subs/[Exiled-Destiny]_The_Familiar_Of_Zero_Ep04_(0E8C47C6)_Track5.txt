I am grateful for the Institute's understanding and cooperation.
When receiving an order from the Palace,
there is no room for such concerns.
Then...
How about dinner sometime, Miss Longueville?
That would be an honor, Count Mott.
I will look forward to it.
Yes.
What kind of impossibility did the Palace ask for this time?
Oh, they just came to warn us to be careful of thieves.
Thieves?
Lately, a fellow named Fouquet has been causing a stir
by using magic to steal treasures,
concentrating on those of the nobility...
Fouquet the Sculptor?
In our Institute, there is the sacred treasure
that we have borrowed from the Palace,
the Staff of Destruction.
The Staff of Destruction...
What a troubling name.
I don't know how splendid a mage this Fouquet is,
but the treasure vault here is a special one,
layered with many spells by Square-class mages.
They're being overly anxious about it.
Wait...
A history of the couple's romance that starts from the first kiss
You, the one who cast magic on this destiny, suddenly appeared
The sky where two moons never fade away
That's an impossibility, right?
This is the first time I've felt anything like this
I'm feeling more and more at ease with this place
Even if you trip and become depressed
I will always hold you tight with a squeeze
The story where we met that day stays hot with a sweet kiss
See, you can cast magic, and the wishes will surely come true
A history of the couple's romance that starts from the first kiss
You, the one who cast magic on this destiny, suddenly appeared
A Maid's Crisis
So cold...
Why am I doing this so late?
This is silk, you know?
You have to be more gentle and careful in washing it!
Start over!
Dammit! What's with being gentle and careful?
I'm sorry. Did I startle you?
Oh, it's just you, Siesta.
Yes.
You have to make sure to dry silk in the shade.
Here.
You're a lifesaver.
I've never washed anything by hand before I came here.
Come to think of it, Mr. Saito, where are you from?
Well... How do I put it...
Anyway, somewhere very far away.
Very.
Um, Mr. Saito?
Thank you so much.
What's this, out of the blue?
You never give up no matter what happens,
and you stand up against nobility even though you're a peasant.
Seeing you like that, Mr. Saito, has given me lots of courage.
I can continue to do my best all because of you, Mr. Saito.
Well, thanks...
Good night.
Yeah. Good night.
Somehow, she seemed to be acting funny.
Oh?
Hey, I have to get up early tomorrow, so I'll see you later.
You know that sword I bought the other day?
That huge, shiny one?
I don't need it,
and since I bought it, I might as well give it to you.
Seriously? For free?
Of course.
For starters, let's talk inside.
Well, if it's just talk...
This is great after all!
It makes you feel like a hero
when you have something like this on your back.
You don't have to be so reserved.
But Louise...
Don't worry about Valliere. This is a sign of my love.
Hey, can I ask you something?
What is it?
Why me?
You have hordes of men after you all the time.
You have lots of things that none of them have.
There's just no comparison.
Do I really? For instance?
Well...
Speech and mannerisms that seem to indicate an ill-bred childhood,
your shabby appearance, the slight feeling of uncleanliness...
I'm gonna go home.
Oh, wait... Did I say something that upset you?
All of it!
Wait a minute.
Well, then...
How about this?
What is it?
It's a talisman ring. What is it?
It's a talisman ring.
It's very valuable.
Don't want it.
Then, how about this?
An earring of a fire-eater bird's blood.
Don't want it.
Then, what about this?
This book is our family heirloom.
You know, accepting anything would be a problem.
You don't seem to get it...
I won't let you get away.
Hey...
The von Zerbst's blood,
that of the hunter of love, is getting excited.
Hunter?
Targets that are hardest to obtain turn me on the most.
Louise!
You always show up that way.
We're going home, Dog.
Yes!
I've told you often enough.
You're stupid, to accept another one of her offers so readily!
Well...
Since Kirche said that she would give me that shiny gold sword...
I couldn't help it.
You were the one that said you were fine with that one.
Well, that's true, but if I can get it for free...
An ornament like that means nothing to you!
A familiar that follows someone so readily after being lured by bait
needs more punishment.
Wait, anything but that...
Stupid dog!
From now on, you can wait outside with all the other familiars.
Why?
Why? You snore, peek up other girls' skirts...
You couldn't embarrass me more!
Stay put until my class is over. Understood?
Yeah...
Stop it!
Get off me! Geez...
I can't stay in a place like that!
Hey, it's Our Sword! I can't stay in a place like that!
Hey, it's Our Sword!
Our Sword! Swing by the kitchen again!
Sure thing!
Sorry that I'm always mooching off you guys.
You don't need to be modest.
These are all leftovers of those nobles, anyway.
By the way, where is Siesta?
Oh, that's right.
She's not on the kitchen staff, so she's not always here...
Siesta didn't tell you?
She quit?!
Yeah. It was sudden, but it was decided
that she would be a servant for this nobleman called Count Mott.
She was picked up and taken away in a carriage early this morning.
You're kidding! Why so suddenly?
In the end,
peasants can do nothing but obey every word of the nobles.
Now, work... Back to work.
Siesta...
Why didn't you tell me?
Count Mott is a messenger from the Palace,
and comes by the Institute occasionally.
I don't like him, because he always acts so cocky.
But why would Siesta be sent to work for someone with that rank?
When a nobleman requests a young girl by name,
it's usually an order for her to become his mistress.
You don't even know that much?
Mistress?
Is that for real?!
I hear stories like that. Nobles come in all sorts.
Siesta...
How wonderful! A mythril brooch.
Don't you think it will look good on you, Montmorency?
And with this, I'm supposed to pretend nothing ever happened?
Don't tell me you believe what that vulgar familiar said...
Sorry for being so vulgar.
Saito!
Are you going to get in the way of someone's romance again?!
I just want to ask something.
He's not back for dinner either?
Oh, where's Saito?
What's that?
Oh, this?
I feel sorry for him, having such crude meals all the time,
so I thought about giving him a bit of my meal.
You're trying to catch his heart through bait now?
Don't you feed someone else's familiar without permission!
I can't bait him if he's not here.
Where did he go?
He went to go wash dust cloths, and still hasn't come back.
Where is he wasting time?
By the way, earlier he asked me for directions to Count Mott's manor.
Count Mott?!
Maybe he got fed up with you and decided to serve a different noble?
Though I've never heard of a familiar switching masters.
But this is Louise's familiar.
Oh, that's right!
Though I can't possibly imagine Count Mott,
someone who works in the Palace, using someone like him...
Louise?
This is it...
Damn that snob.
He didn't tell me that it was a full hour's walk away!
Who are you?
Hello...
How is the work? Have you gotten used to it?
Yes. For the most part.
I see, I see.
Well, don't overexert yourself too much.
Yes, sir.
I didn't hire you just for household chores, Siesta.
Um...
What is it?
A Saito is here to see you! What is it?
A Saito is here to see you!
Saito? Never heard of him.
Impossible...
I wondered what it could be, but how meaningless...
Go home!
Just be thankful that I went out of my way to see a peasant!
Please!
If you let Siesta go back to the Institute, I'll do anything!
What kind of relationship do you have with Siesta?
Well, we're coworkers that work in the same place,
though we work in different departments.
A servant of the Institute?
Um...
I heard that when a nobleman requests a young girl by name,
it's usually her job to be something like a mistress.
Siesta is an official servant of the Mott household now.
The master is free to do whatever he wishes to his servants.
Just as I thought!
What of it, say you?
A nameless peasant like you,
providing services to a valuable nobleman like me...
There is no greater honor!
That's full of crap!
You're just doing whatever pleases you
because you know Siesta can't say no!
That's just unfair, you old baboon!
You, a mere peasant, dare to insult a nobleman?!
Sit down right there!
Stop it, Mr. Saito!
Siesta! You were there?
Count, please forgive this individual's rudeness!
I will not have it!
If I leave such a peasant's rudeness be,
I will tarnish the name of Jour de Mott!
Stand aside, Siesta!
I cannot!
What?! I cannot!
What?!
Count Mott, I beg of you. I will accept any punishment...
Siesta! Out of the way!
Saito, wasn't it? You said you would do anything?
Is that really so?
Yeah.
My hobby is to collect printed matter.
Actually, there is a book that I cannot cease to desire.
What book is it?
A book that a certain mage chanced to summon in an experiment.
I hear that it is the heirloom of an established family in Germania.
The daughter of that family is currently at the Institute.
Germania? I think I've heard of that place before.
I am not certain whether or not you, a peasant, know of her,
but she is the daughter of the Zerbst family.
Zerbst?
If you want Siesta back,
you must bring me the Zerbst family heirloom.
Kirche, of all people...
Louise?!
What in the world were you thinking?
Why?
I don't care, just get on! Sheesh!
You're dealing with one of the higher-ups from the Palace.
You can't even begin to make a comparison between him and Guiche.
But don't you feel sorry for Siesta?
Of course I take pity for her situation, but it can't be helped!
You can't just brush it off!
Don't scream right behind me!
Yeah, yeah.
Anyway, just give up about Siesta.
Got it?
Yeah... Got it.
Then hurry up and go to sleep.
Yeah...
Honest as always, so they say.
Our family heirloom?
Oh, that.
I'm not Tabitha, so I don't really care.
I've never even opened the book.
You had it the whole time?
They made me bring it, to prepare for my wedding.
Prepare for your wedding?
I heard that it has the effect of stimulating men's sexual desires.
No wonder why that old baboon wants it.
I don't need something like this in the first place.
Don't you agree?
Well, yeah.
So I don't mind giving it to you.
Seriously?
But in return, you have to go out with me.
Hey, isn't that a good deal?
You know...
You damned nobles are all rotten!
Saito!
What's he so upset about?
Come on, do what I'm telling you to!
Miss Siesta...
Yes?
The Count is waiting in his bedchamber. Please hurry.
Yes...
Mr. Saito...
Hey, wake up!
What are you doing?
Stupid dog...
Kirche?
Wait, why are you here?
There's no time for that!
Valliere, your familiar...
Why do these things happen one after another?
But that's part of Saito's charm.
You've got to be kidding!
Think about the one that has to take care of that familiar!
A noble's mansion.
If a peasant were to draw a sword...
Oh, brother.
It really was a short relationship with this partner.
Is there anywhere I can get in?
Who's there?
You're...
Thanks for everything earlier today.
Ouch...
Come on, let go.
Let him go.
Man, that hurts.
What were you planning to do, with such a thing on your back?
The roads are dangerous at night.
No noble is whimsical enough to simply
hand over a treasure to a mere peasant.
I wanted to enjoy your struggles,
but you certainly gave up quickly. How boring.
I didn't give up.
I'm going to rescue Siesta!
You drew?
If he draws a sword in a nobleman's mansion,
a peasant can't complain if he gets executed on the spot!
I know that.
It won't just be your familiar. You'll be responsible too.
I know that!
Tabitha, hurry.
Mansion. Landing.
I have never seen such a foolish peasant as you.
People tell me that a lot.
Something's wrong.
When I was fighting Guiche...
I am known as Mott the Surge, a Triangle-class mage.
So what?
My body is shaking... Dammit!
What?!
I can do something like this as well.
Saito!
What?!
Louise?
The level of conduct of the Institute's pupils has fallen so.
I must impose a severe penalty on Old Osman over this.
My apologies for entering the estate without permission,
as the situation required me to act swiftly.
And...
The misconduct of the familiar is the misconduct of his master,
yours truly, Louise de la Valliere.
I am willing to accept any form of punishment.
Louise...
Pointing a sword at an official of the Palace is a serious crime.
Be prepared to have your entire family face the consequences.
Hold on, I'm the one at fault here!
Count Mott,
how about we make a deal with this?
What are you...
I hear that you have a tremendous desire to possess this, Count.
Pardon my belated introduction.
My name is Kirche von Zerbst.
Zerbst?
Then that is...
Yes, it is our family heirloom, the summoned book.
Here.
This is that famed book...
Is it all right? It's your family heirloom, right?
I peeked inside it, but I don't need anything of that sort.
Unnecessary.
Anyway... First off, give Siesta back to us!
Hand Siesta over to them.
Yes, sir!
It opened!
This is...
I don't know what language these letters are in,
but to think there was such a thing in this world...
Erotic PUNCH April'75 issue
Japanese?!
April'75 issue Japanese?!
April'75 issue
It's an old porn magazine.
Porn magazine?
Hey, you said earlier that the book was summoned?
Right.
My grandfather just happened to summon that book.
Summoned...
The same thing that happened to me.
That's...
The same?
Honestly, thank you so very much.
No, in the end, it was all thanks to Kirche.
But it was all because you did your best, Mr. Saito.
Besides, Louise also...
Good night!
Good night.
You know...
We're going back to our room.
Thanks, Louise.
I'm really sorry about this.
You stay quiet for a bit!
I'm thinking about how heavily I need to punish you right now!
So there's going to be something after all?
Of course!
A hundred lashes with the whip is too easy on you.
Oh! Maybe no meals until you almost die?
Wait a minute, can't you show a tiny bit of mercy...
That's impossible!
Forgive me! That's impossible!
Forgive me!
Can't! That's impossible!
No way!
As if I were under a real magic spell
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart
But each time I see you, I give you a pointy, cold shoulder
Why do I act mean towards the one that I think about the most?
My true feelings, the shards of loneliness
In the deepest part of my heart, I'm calling for you
For the day to start from zero
However you look at my familiar, there's nothing good about him.
But we have to have the entire Institute
judge every one of our familiars?!
It's so depressing.
