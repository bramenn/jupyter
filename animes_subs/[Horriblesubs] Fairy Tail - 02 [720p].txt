The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
Last time on Fairy Tail!
You were looking for a dragon?
I feel sick...
I've been tricked!
I won't forgive those who pretend to be from Fairy Tail!
That's going overboard!
Come join our guild!
Sure!
The Magic Council, Era.
Those idiots from Fairy Tail are at it again!
This time they've destroyed half a port!
Now they've done it!
I quite like those bunch of fools, personally.
Indeed they are quite the fools, yes.
But they've assembled many wizards of talent and ability.
I guess you take the good with the bad.
Just leave them be.
Without those fools, this world would be boring.
Fire Dragon, Monkey, and Bull!
We're back!
We're back!
Yo!
What's up!
Hey!
There you go makin' trouble again!
You half destroyed Harge-
Why?
That info about the salamander was a lie, wasn't it?
How would I know?
I just told you some rumors that've been going around!
What'd you say?!
You wanna go?
Now, now, Natsu...
This isn't something to get-
Wow...
I've actually made it into Fairy Tail!
So Natsu's back?
This man is Gray Fullbuster.
He is capable at his work, but has a small...
We're gonna finish what we started, Natsu!
Gray... Your clothes.
Oops!
This woman is Cana Alberona, the biggest drinker in all of Fairy Tail.
This is why all the men here have no class.
Let's do this!
Put some clothes on and have at me!
All this crying and whining before noon?
What a bunch of babies!
This man is Elfman.
He'll solve any kind of job with only his fists.
He's a hyper-muscled wizard.
If you're a man, then talk with your fists!
Oh, he's actually encouraging them...
Outta our way!
And he's already out for the count!
My, how noisy it is.
This man is Loke.
He's high up on the list of Most Eligible Wizards.
I'm gonna mix it up, just for you all!
Good luck!
Okay, this guy just went off my list.
But man, what's with this place?
Is there not a single serious wizard in the joint?
Oh, it's a newcomer!
Mirajane!
In the flesh!
This woman is Mirajane.
A wizard that does photo spreads in the Weekly Sorcerer.
She currently is an employee at Fairy Tail.
Um, are you sure it's okay not to stop them?
They're always like this.
It's better to leave them alone.
And anyway...
Isn't it fun?
Mirajane-san!
My underwear!
Miss, would you be so kind as to lend me your under-
As if!
These indelicate oafs causing you trouble?
Men talk with their fists!
You're in the way!
Aye!
Everyone's being so loud! I can't relax and drink.
I've had enough out of all of you!
Now you've done it!
What troublemakers you are.
Bring it on!
Shield
They're gonna fight with magic?
Aye!
Aye, nothing!
Stop this, you fools!
A giant!
Oh, you were here, Master?
Yes.
Master?!
Everyone's scared stiff!
Victory is mi-
A new recruit, are we?
Y-Yes!
Glad to have you on board!
Now he's tiny!
And wait, if you're the master...
That's right, this is Fairy Tail's Guild Master, Makarov-san.
You've gone and done it again, rascals!
Look at all this paperwork the council sent me!
They're all complaints!
The council.
The Place from Before
The organization that manages all the different Wizard's Guilds.
All you fools do is make the council angry at me!
However...
Screw the council!
Listen up!
Magic is an unreasonable power, but it is born from reason!
It is not some miraculous ability.
It is the combination of the spirit that flows withing us
with the spirit that flows within nature itself, incarnated into physical form!
It takes a strong mind and focus!
In fact, magic is the pouring out of ones entire soul!
One cannot progress in the way of magic by being mindful of the watchful eye from above!
Be not afraid of those fools on the council!
And follow the path you believe in!
That's what it means to be a Fairy Tail wizard!
And then...
And with this, you're now a member of Fairy Tail.
Natsu, take a look!
I got Fairy Tail's mark!
You did? That's nice, Luigi.
It's Lucy!
This is the request board.
The wizards can choose whatever jobs they like from the requests posted here.
Let's do one with a big reward!
Ooh, 160,000 jewel for subduing some thieves!
Then, it's decided!
Hasn't my dad come back yet?
You're getting annoying, Romeo.
If you're the son of a wizard, then believe in him and wait patiently at home!
But he said he'd be back in three days, and he hasn't come home for a week!
That was a job at Mt. Hakobe, if I recall.
It's not that far away! Go out and look for him!
Your old man is a wizard!
And there ain't a wizard in this guild who can't take care of himself!
Go home and drink some milk or something!
Jerk!
Damn it!
Must be hard on him.
His words were harsh, but the master is actually worried.
Hey, Natsu, don't break the board!
Master, you sure about this?
He's going to save Macao, you know.
This is why he's still such a kid.
All this is gonna do is hurt Macao's pride.
No one can decide what someone else should do with their life.
Leave him be!
What's he doing?
Natsu is just like Romeo-kun, see.
The same thing happened with Natsu.
All the wizards at Fairy Tail carry something with them.
A scar, or pain... or suffering...
Why are you here?
Why not?
Anyway, you really can't handle transportation, can you?
There's so much to pity you for...
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, nothing.
Natsu's father left and never came back.
Well, it's not his real father, but the parent who raised him.
Not to mention a dragon.
A dragon?
Natsu was raised by a dragon?
He was found by that dragon in the forest when he was little...
And it taught him how to read and educated him, and taught him magic.
But...
But, one day, it vanished, and Natsu couldn't find it.
I see, so that's Igneel.
Natsu is looking forward to meeting Igneel again someday.
It's kind of cute of him, don't you think?
We've arrived?
We stopped!
Revival!
Sorry, but we can't go any further.
Wait...
What the heck?
It's freezing!
Okay, I know it's a mountain and all, but it's summer!
There's something not right about this blizzard!
That's what you get for wearing such thin clothes!
I don't see you wearing a parka, either!
Lend me your muffler!
Man, she's annoying.
Aye!
That's it!
Gate of the Clock, I open thee!
Horologium!
Ooh, a clock!
Cool!
I can't hear you.
She says I'll be in here.
Why did you come with me?
She says What job did Macao-san come here to do?
You didn't know and tagged along?
He was subduing a vicious monster, a Vulcan!
She says I want to go home.
And I say Go right ahead.
Aye.
Macao, you here?
Macao!
It's a Vulcan!
Hey, you!
A human woman!
So it can talk?
Who cares? Now, rescue me! she says...
Near the peak of Mt. Hakobe.
Why'd this have to happen to me?
And what's with this monkey... He's way too hyper!
A woman!
Hey, Horologium! Don't disappear on me!
It is time. Fare thee well!
I want an extension! An extension!
Monkey!
Where is Macao?!
Lame...
Is he incapable of making a normal entrance?
Hey, monkey! Where's Macao?
You can understand me, right?
I'm asking about Macao, a human man.
Man?
That's right! Where are you hiding him?!
He's already decided the monkey's hiding him?
Oh, I think it's getting through to him.
Where?
Monkey!
Natsu!
I don't need men! I like women!
Oh, no...
He's not dead, is he?
Natsu...
Woman, woman, woman, woman!
Okay you pervy monkey, get a load of this!
Gate of the Golden Bull, I open thee!
Taurus!
A cow?
Taurus is the most powerful of all the Celestial spirits I have contracts with!
Lucy-san, your body always does you good...
Could you be any moo-re lovely?
Oh yeah, he's a perv, too...
How dare you take my woman!
Your woman?
I will have no moo-re of that!
Taurus!
Rampage!
He's fast!
Natsu!
I was pretty useless, wasn't I?
Weak!
Hey, aren't there more monsters now?
He's an ally, you dolt!
A Celestial spirit!
The monkey?
No, the bull!
And wait... How were you saved?
It's all thanks to Happy.
Aye!
You can't handle transportation, but I guess Happy is no problem, huh?
What are you talking about?
Happy isn't transportation.
Happy is my partner. You're mean!
R-Right... I'm sorry.
That's my woman!
Listen up!
Everyone in Fairy Tail are my friends and allies!
The old man and Mira, and even those annoying jerks Gray and Elfman...
Happy and Lucy and everyone are all my friends...
And that's why I'm gonna bring Macao back home!
That won't work against fire!
Uh, oh.
That's Taurus' ax!
Lucy-wucy...
Natsu!
Taurus, go back!
If you do then the ax will disappear too!
He's melting the ax... with his body heat?
And he's eating it, too...
Aye!
Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up.
Let's go!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
We did it!
Weren't you going to ask that monkey where Macao-san is?
Oh yeah, I forgot.
He's completely knocked out.
What?
Macao!
Wait, that's him? Wasn't he a pervy monkey just a second ago?
The Vulcan must have done a Take Over.
Take Over?
It's magic to occupy someone's body.
Vulcans are monsters that live by stealing human bodies and taking them over.
It looks like he put up a serious fight before he was taken over.
Macao!
Don't you die on me!
Romeo's waitin' for you!
Open your eyes!
Natsu...
Macao!
I'm pitiful...
I defeated 19 of them...
But I got taken over by the 20th one.
I can't believe myself, man...
Damn it... I can't show my face to Romeo like this...
That's not true!
You did great defeating that many!
No way... There's more than one of those monkeys?
And he was doing a job like that by himself?
Let's get you home. Romeo's waiting for you.
Just amazing...
I really can't match up to them.
What are you grinning about, Lucy?
You're scaring me.
I'll pull out your whiskers, cat!
Fairy Tail wizard's ain't nothin'!
They're just a bunch of cowards who spend all their time drinking!
We all want to become knights when we grow up!
Wizards are all a bunch of drunks!
Dad, go do a job!
I can't stand this anymore!
Okay!
Romeo!
Dad!
Dad, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry I made you worry.
It's okay... I'm the son of a wizard, after all.
Can your old man defeat 19 monsters, huh?!
Natsu!
Happy!
Thank you!
Sure thing!
Aye!
And thank you too, Lucy!
July 4th. Sunny, then a blizzard, then sunny once again.
Fairy Tail might be one crazy messed up guild...
But it's fun, and warm hearted, and kind...
I might just be starting out as a wizard,
but I love this guild!
Finally, my first gig!
I'm so nervous!
Can I handle it right?
You'll do fine, Lucy.
Mira-san!
I heard all about your adventures the other day.
They say you defeated some guerrilla mercenaries.
That was Natsu,
you've got it all wrong...
Next time: Infiltrate the Everlue Mansion!
So, what kind of job did you take, Lucy?
A maid...
Huh?
