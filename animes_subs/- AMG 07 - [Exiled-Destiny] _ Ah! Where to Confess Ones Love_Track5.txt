Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
Let's see... slippers, detergent, and...
Oh, I forgot to get clothespins!
Really? That's great.
Living on your own is more expensive than you'd think.
Then why don't you move in with Keiichi?
No way! I'm finally moving to the city.
I'm going to enjoy single life to the fullest!
Plus, I don't want to get in the way of you two... huh?
Hey, that's right, it's White Day.
Did you already get something from Kei today?
What?
A return gift for the chocolates. I bet he gave something neutral like cookies...
Chocolates, did you say?
Wait a minute, you didn't know about Valentine's Day last month?
No.
So in other words...
Ah! Where to Confess One's Love?
What? You practice such customs here on Earth?
I wouldn't say'on Earth'... It's more like'in Japan.'
But in a relationship like yours, giving Kei chocolates would be a no-brainer.
Megumi, did you offer a gift to someone as well?
No, because I don't care about that kind of stuff.
But Kei might be taking it a little hard.
Has he been acting strangely at all recently?
Now that you mention it...
Another sunny day today.
Yes. Another sunny day today.
It's the 2nd week of February. Spring is right around the corner.
It certainly is.
I was wondering if you know about any of the customs we have here on Earth?
Yes, I am familiar with several of them.
Are you?
What day is it today again?
It's Monday.
If it's Monday, then that means... right...
It must be the 14th. I see...
Oh, I just remembered!
What? Oh, I just remembered!
The 14th is the day the Auto Club presents its monthly expense report.
Right, that's right.
Oh boy, he was so waiting for it, wasn't he!
I don't really have a good grasp on the customs here.
But you guys are living together... you can't blame him for being depressed.
I'm sorry...
Hey, Megumi, I didn't know you were here.
We should be heading for school soon.
All right. I'll go get ready now.
Hold on!
Huh?
I need to go somewhere with Belldandy today, so you go on ahead to class.
I'll be going, then.
Um... I think I'll go and apologize to Keiichi.
Wait!
Don't apologize, it'll make things worse.
But... Don't apologize, it'll make things worse.
I've got a better idea. Just do what I say!
Let this mouth-watering chocolate be suffused with...
I knew you could do it, Belldandy!
No question about it, Kei's gonna be thrilled!
Do you really think so?
You really look happy yourself.
Yes, that's my reason for being here... to make Keiichi happy.
I'm really glad... that you're the woman in Kei's life.
Now all you have to do is take Kei to a romantic spot and hand it to him.
And tell him,'Sorry I was late!'
And that will fix everything?
You can't miss!
All right!
Man... it's March already, huh?
Keiichi?
Hey, weren't you going out with Megumi today?
Um... actually, I have something for you, see...
Are you out of your mind?
Trying to give me that ugly bouquet in an unromantic place like this?
How insensitive are you?
Unromantic?
Take him to a romantic spot and hand it to him.
Is this what you'd call an unromantic place?
Huh? Well, I guess most people would say that.
Is that right?
Excuse me.
Hey, wait! Belldandy! Excuse me.
Hey, wait! Belldandy!
Really! These days you can throw a rock and hit 10 clueless guys like him!
Excuse me?
Oh, it's you! What do you want?
I was wondering if you could tell me where I can find a'romantic spot.'
Romantic...
You see, I have to give Keiichi these chocolates in a romantic place.
Being sarcastic?
What?
I get it now!
You're just gushing over Morisato like that to make me give up on him, right?
Give up on him? What do you mean?
Are you playing dumb again?
Playing dumb?
Listen, you!
Wait a minute... is this girl just naive?
Um...
Um... so can you tell me about the spot?
A romantic spot, you say?
So you're going to tell me where I can find one?
Sure I'll tell you, but in return, I want you to meow like a cat!
Meow!
Stick your head outside and shout'Yahoo!'
Yahoo!
Yahoo! Yahoo!
No question about it now... Yahoo! Yahoo!
Yahoo!
I guess I have no choice. Come with me.
All right!
So he's going to come here?
Yes.
Oh, here he comes! That's him.
If anyone knows about romantic spots, it's that guy.
Really?
Thank you very much!
Do you have any idea who that guy is?
The No. 1 Casanova on campus... Toshiyuki Aoshima!
If you approach him...
Excuse me...
Would you please tell me where I can find a'romantic spot'?
I've never seen her before.
Both her body and looks make the grade...
I guess today's my lucky day!
Very well. Let's go, then.
What?
Wait! Come back! That's not fair!
Now that you're in that rogue's clutches he'll have his way with you, and once...
I wonder if Belldandy went on home?
She sure was acting kind of weird...
Hmm?
Belldandy?
Belldandy!
Huh?
Dammit! Why did it have to die on me at a time like this?
I'm sorry!
Are you saying that this is a romantic spot?
That's right.
Would Keiichi really be happy if I brought him to a place like this?
Keiichi?
Excuse me, can you think of another place?
Huh?
It's just that I don't think Keiichi would like it if I brought him here.
Who gives a damn about a guy like that?
I brought you here because I wanted to make you happy!
But that won't do... the goal is to make Keiichi happy!
That's my duty.
Duty?
Do you mean that jerk is actually forcing you to...
No, he's not forcing me at all...
That's precisely why I want Keiichi to be happy.
I don't know what your motive was, but the fact is that you came here with me.
What are you doing?
What do you mean? You know perfectly well!
Why are you running? You're the one who pretty much said you wanted me.
I never said such a thing!
It's a little late to say no! I want you to come here!
You've hit a dead end.
I have no choice, then.
Run, O Spirit of Lightning, release yourself from your shackles...
And subject this man to an ordeal!
I don't know what kind of spell... And subject this man to an ordeal!
I don't know what kind of spell...
W-What the hell is this?
Where did she go?
W-What the hell is going on?
Belldandy!
Belldandy!
Belldandy! Belldandy!
All right, I'm gonna change now, so you stay out!
B-But...
Didn't you hear a word I said?
That guy duped her into going with him, that's all.
She's from another country. She doesn't know how things are done in Japan.
If that's the case, I guess it's all right.
See ya!
You went along with him to find a romantic spot, is that it?
Yes. I'm so sorry.
What am I gonna do with you?
Um... could you tell me? Where a romantic spot might be?
Sure, I could do that, but...
I want to make Keiichi happy, no matter what.
Kei, you're such a lucky dog.
Ugh... Senior, I can't do it anymore...
Good morning!
Whoa! Belldandy!
Um... I wanted to ask you if you had any plans for today?
Huh? No, I'm not doing anything.
Um, there's someplace I'd like to go.
I was wondering if you'd accompany me...
Well, sure...
Then please come to the living room after you've gotten dressed.
Now all you have to do is take him to places he likes.
All right.
But the thing is, I'm not really sure what kind of place he'd like.
Don't worry!
As long as you go with him, he'll have a ball no matter where you take him!
You can have these.
What are they?
I won them in the prize-drawing at a party.
If you take him there, I guarantee he'll have himself a blast.
One more thing, you two have to be alone together, always.
Three's a crowd.
But why is that?
I always thought the more the merrier...
Because then it won't be fun for him anymore!
Are you sure that's how he'd feel?
Hey, trust me! That's how any guy would feel!
Okay then, good luck!
Someplace she'd like to go? I wonder what's up with her, all of a sudden...
We haven't had much time to be alone lately, so I guess it's good timing.
This is where you wanted to go?
Yes!
I thought you'd have a good time if we came here.
You did? Well, thanks.
I wanted to go, but I didn't have the money so I'd given up on the idea.
Um, are you having a good time?
Of course I am! Thanks so much, Belldandy!
I'm so glad!
I thought I'd shadow them, but it looks like there's nothing to worry about.
Still, this is the last place anyone would call romantic.
Wow!
This is awesome!
Hey, it's my turn now!
Oh, sorry!
So this is what Megumi was talking about... a'romantic spot'!
All righty, I guess it's time for the third wheel to back out...
Wanna go look at the stuff over there?
Yeah! Wanna go look at the stuff over there?
Oh my gosh, what can I do to distract those two?
I got it!
Oh, man! I just touched it and the whole thing broke off!
Broke?
This is where you and I come in!
Hey! You can just leave that to us!
It just so happens, we're from the NIT Auto Club...
Hey, it's the Seniors?
Whoops, I forgot, Kei's a member of the Auto Club too!
Uh... um...
This is a shrine to those of us in the Auto Club and you dare bring...
Unforgivable! Now then, why don't you just come with us...
We must decline!
Belldandy?
I must spend the day alone with Keiichi today.
Huh?
Now then, shall we go, Keiichi?
Uh, sure...
What was that all about?
You don't think... she doesn't like us anymore?
Hey, she's tougher than I thought.
I guess there's no need for me to follow them anymore!
Good luck, now!
I wonder what's going on?
Hey, I really had a great time!
Now why don't we go someplace where you can enjoy yourself...
Oh, no! That won't do!
I must see to it that you have a good time today!
Let's see...
Oh, I know! Come on, let's go there!
Let's go where?
What is this place?
You can fix cars to your heart's content here!
Well, maybe I can, but...
It's not fun here?
No, of course it's fun!
I'm sorry.
Such a variety of cars and motorcycles!
Uh-huh...
No good either?
Look at all these ancient cars!
I'm so sorry!
No, don't be.
I mean, I hardly ever get the chance to come to a place like this!
Hey, look at this one, it's awesome.
So they used parts like these back in the old days, huh?
Listen, I really do appreciate all your concern for me, but...
You seem somewhat blue these days... That's why I...
Because I want you to always have a smile on your face, Keiichi.
Gotcha!
In that case, there's a place I want to go. Will you come with me?
It's just a ferry that's been around for ages.
But I like doing this... taking the last boat at sunset.
Is that so?
I'd like to know what made you act the way you did today.
Um, you see, since I didn't give you chocolate for Valentine's Day...
Is that the reason?
But you don't know the customs here on Earth.
You didn't have to feel bad about it.
Please forgive me. How can I call myself your goddess...
That's why you were trying so hard to show me a good time?
Yes...
But...
I am a failure as a goddess.
That's not true! I had such a good time today!
But...
I'm telling you the truth. I mean, I had you by my side...
That's what makes me happy!
But I have to fulfill my job as a goddess...
All right, then, I want you to take me to a place that you like, Belldandy.
What?
I want to know what places you like, Belldandy.
To learn more about you... there's nothing I'd enjoy more right now.
Keiichi...
It's right here.
This is my favorite place to be.
Where the wind crossing the vast ocean meets...
You can hear so many different voices right here. It's such a lovely place.
This is it... this is a'romantic spot,' isn't it?
Here.
Huh?
Forgive me for not giving it to you sooner...
Oh, hold on a minute!
Here!
It's for you, in return.
Keiichi...
Belldandy...
Keiichi!
Why does it always end up like this?
Just one more inch...
So you did give it to him!
Yes!
That's great!
Yes!
Caught a cold?
Uh, no...
There's something wrong after all. Come to think of it...
The System Force has vanished, too.
Then does all this sneezing mean...
One day when I woke up...
A day like any other... another one just beginning.
There you are, yawning... your face is still so sleepy.
Because each peaceful day we share is a miracle to me.
This is where my heart will always return...
Forever...
There's only one thing I wish for.
I chase after the same dream, wherever it may go.
The love I feel for you gives me strength.
May tomorrow be as joyful as today...
That's my wish...
Blood ties... connections made by destiny.
A connection that's no different even if you happen to be goddesses.
