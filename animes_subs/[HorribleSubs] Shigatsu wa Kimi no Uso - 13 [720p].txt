Please!
Really... What am I going to do with you?
Idiot husband!
Better brace yourself!
Or I'm gonna step out on you!
Hiro-chan, did you have another fight with your husband?
This is no fight. This is war!
If he apologizes, we're done for good.
Idiot husband!
Better brace yourself!
Or I'm gonna step out on you!
Kousei...
You...
How can you play the piano?
Why wouldn't I be able to play the piano?
Saki!
Let's turn Kousei into a pianist!
Kousei's...
Kousei's
I'm heading out now.
By yourself?
Yes.
Are you serious?
Yes.
What are you going to play? Without a violi-
I'm not changing the song.
It's not music or anything at all!
See, I'm pissed.
So I'm going to prove it.
Just how great a musician Kaori Miyazono is.
And besides...
This is a supreme directive from the shrew.
These galas are all about standing out.
Wait, this is a violin concert, right?
Is that accompanist going to play on his own?
This is all your fault.
Because you put me back on the stage.
Always... you always move me.
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me!
I'm going to prove it. That I'm incredible.
That Kaori Miyazono, who's named me to be her accompanist...
Once again, unprecedented! Arima again?
This isn't the accompaniment. This is...
Kreisler... Love's Sorrow... Rachmaninoff's Piano Arrangement.
The song that Saki loved...
So you've been facing it alone all this time. But...
Is this the Love's Sorrow that you've always known?
Just watch...
Just watch... Just watch...
I'm incredible... Kaori Miyazono is...
Gala Concert
Unbelievable!
So powerful!
What a disappointment.
He's only venting his anger.
He's confusing crudeness with ferocity.
This grates on my ears.
Huh?
Was I pounding the keys that hard?
My whole body is taut...
This won't do at all.
This piece isn't... This isn't how you play it, right?
The song that I always listened to was...
This song was my lullaby...
I don't understand...
Even though I can't hear the notes as usual,
I can hear the sound inside me.
I think it means that you're not bound by sounds.
Wasn't there ever a moment
when you sensed the notes suffused with your desires and emotions?
Losing the ability to hear the notes...
I'm sure that that's... a gift.
Kousei...
Play it more gently.
Like you're caressing a baby's head.
Play it like you're embracing him.
Mom... This song... If it were her,
would she have played it like this?
His playing style just changed...
He's doing it again.
The sound is changing.
Kousei...
It's Saki.
Saki is there...
Saki!
Even for you, that's going too far!
Hitting him hard enough to draw blood - that's way too harsh!
You call yourself a mother?
Kousei was doing his best just to make you happy!
I know that! Of course I know that!
Saki!
I do know that... But...
I'm... running out of time.
Saki...
Help me... Please help me...
Somebody help me... The notes... The piano... My hearing is...
I can't hear the notes! Somebody... Please help me...
Mom...
Kousei...
I'm the one who drove you into this corner.
It's all because I told her to turn you into a pianist.
I'm so sorry...
If music only brings Kousei pain and suffering...
I'm so sorry...
Then I have no business being by his side.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Kousei Arima Sumitani Junior Highschool
But...
Kousei has returned.
What made you turn to the piano?
I want to see that sight again with my own eyes one more time.
That's what made me think...
That I'd like become a really weird pianist!
After losing Saki, Kousei...
If Kousei believes in that, then as a pianist,
how can I not believe in the power of music?
Saki. Be sure to watch this.
That son of ours
is about to bid you a last farewell.
Oh...
I can't help thinking about her, after all.
This song has my mother's scent.
Who are you going to play it for?
Will it reach her?
I hope it reaches her.
After I'm gone...
What's going to become of Kousei?
Will be able to earn a living?
Can he make music his livelihood?
All I can do right now is make him play accurately, faithful to the score.
As long as he has the skills, he just might be able to support himself someday.
What a terrible mother...
There's nothing I can leave that boy...
Will he brush his teeth every morning?
He falls asleep anywhere, so what if he catches a cold?
He isn't good at sports, so what if he gets seriously injured?
I wish I could've stayed with him longer...
Will my treasure... ever find happiness?
I knew all along. The ghost of my mother was a shadow of my own creation.
An excuse for me to run away.
My own weakness.
Mom isn't there anymore.
Mom... is inside me.
Yes, that's right. The piano...
Hey, hey... Mom?
There's both Love's Joy and Love's Sorrow, so why...
I play it so...
We're all connected.
Just like the notes are intermittently connected...
It's shared by us all.
Through music...
With the people you know,
with the people you don't know,
with all the people in the world.
You come, too!
Just like with her, I'm connected to Mom, too.
I'm moving forward because I believe that.
So... So...
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
My knees are shaking... Guess I'm exhausted?
Kousei!
Kousei!
Hey, look at you, hot stuff!
If my husband hears that his daughter threw herself into a man's arms,
he'll be devastated.
So did you get to see Saki?
My mom...
She's always been by my side.
Yes.
The way I touch the keys, the way I move my fingers, my habit of squeezing the pedals,
my tastes, the order that I eat...
Mom's in every little gesture of mine.
We're... Mom and I are... Connected...
Hiroko-san... Do you think it reached my mom?
The way I played my very best... Do you think it reached Mom?
You dummy. You two are connected, aren't you?
Of course it reached her!
Because of music, I was given the chance to meet others.
I was moved by those encounters. There are people that I got to meet.
I got to discover emotion.
These are all...
Mom, I'm happy.
Thank you. Thank you.
Goodbye...
That was so exquisite...
I'm ready to just go home now!
Oh, the next performance, huh?
I don't want to hear anything right now.
I never thought I'd be so scared to go onstage.
Miike-kun...
Now this is a tough act to follow...
I want to run away...
Mom...
Would I have played my heart out like he did?
Would I have played with as much sincerity as he did?
I want to see if I can sacrifice body and soul like that.
Just watch me.
Right now, all I want to do is hear my mom's voice.
Is his playing softer than usual? I see...
So your heart's been pierced, too?
And you're both going to raise the bar, eh?
That was awesome.
Isn't violin music lovely?
Ms. Ochiai?
I'm glad that I'm a musician.
To obliterate a powerful enemy... Now that's the ultimate pleasure...
A bona fide extreme sadist?
Kousei...
Hey!
Kousei...
Huh?
Huh? This is so weird... I can't find the words to say...
Freaky...
Was it okay for you to just leave?
Well, why not? I was just a throw-in for the throw-in. And besides...
I've got to find that throw-in who blew me off, and rip her a new one.
He's mad.
All right, ready to head home? I'm exhausted from all this.
I want some juice!
Hey, your mom could go for some, too.
Tsubaki?
You've got nothing to say to me after all my hard work?
Huh? Um... You look all grown up.
What's up with that? I was hoping you'd praise me.
Huh?
What the heck? So weird...
If I don't hold them in, I might shed tears. Tears?
Tears of relief because I was able to talk to Kousei normally?
Or because I was able to talk to him normally...
31st - Gala Concert
If you were there at the concert,
you could've said something to me.
You're as spiteful as ever, aren't you?
Ms. Ochiai...
To think that Arima-kun was being mentored by you... That was unexpected.
After all, ever since Saki Arima passed away, you never went near that house.
That boy has changed, too.
He's become quite an intriguing musician.
Yes. Instilling something into his music,
leaving something in those who hear it.
That kid has taken his first steps forward as an artist. But...
The loss of Saki Arima
was tragic for Kousei, and for me,
but was it really necessary for Kousei Arima, the musician?
There's an ever-present sorrow hanging over Arima-kun's music.
If the death of his beloved mother
triggered something in him...
Totsuhara University Hospital
Then it's a demon's path that he must walk.
Kaori Miyazono
His growth is spurred by sorrow...
If Kousei is to walk that path,
Love's Sorrow
he might have to lose someone to move forward.
