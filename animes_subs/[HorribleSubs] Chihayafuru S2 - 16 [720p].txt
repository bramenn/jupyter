Not Enough Money
Will I get to make an appearance this time around?
*nervous*
Poor guy
Grr
They cut down on the extra mini-segments because there isn't enough money?!
Put together a two-hour Saturday 8 o'clock special!
Write a 500 page script!
Don't spend the whole time talking about Chihaya!
Pissed
What?! I thought you were finally going to show my Road to Class A!
Stop toying with me!
Considering my skill, it's obvious that I'll make Class A before Mashima does!
I didn't get any screen time the first season,
so I'll be the main character this time around, yes?
What? I'm not?
My story about giving up on love to pursue my dream of designing
Wait! Who is this Johnny Depp look-alike?!
Lock on
He's so hot!
Good morning.
Impossible...
I was dumped...
I need to find a new boyfriend!
The hottest guy in this school!
This is the last new member, um...
I'm Tsukuba from class 1-10.
Um, nobody was in the classroom...
Are we in here today?
Thank you for coming, Hanano-san!
Thank you!
So the flower has wilted during the long spring rains, just as my beauty has faded
I know this one!
You were happy about taking your first card, right?
You'll start moving faster and faster to take cards, Sumire-chan.
O-Okay, how about your right hand?
Just trim your right hand.
Wait!
Stop this!
I already said that I joined this club to be with Mashima-senpai,
not to play karuta!
Oh...
Oh gosh...
I've had enough!
Wait!
Sumire-chan!
Ayase!
Forget it.
She's made it clear that she doesn't want to play karuta.
Just ignore her.
Ever since I collapsed and had to forfeit last year during the national championship,
I've spent every day wondering what would have happened
if we had one more member.
We finally have new members...
Two of them stayed.
I can't ignore them!
Yesterday, when you said
that Hundred Poets was a bunch of love poems,
I had to admit you were right.
We share the same feelings that they did in the past.
However, Hundred Poets is an anthology of poetry.
Their poems are still known a thousand years later,
because they expressed their feelings and techniques
in adherence to the 31 syllables rule.
The feelings expressed are dependent on the rules!
Do you really think that the president knows your
true feelings after hearing that little outburst?
Hanano-san.
Can you teach me how to put on mascara?
Since I only have three eyelashes...
There's no such thing as a human with only three eyelashes!
Let me see!
This is my eighth year in college now
Adding Eyelashes
I'll have some wagashi to celebrate
Three...
Sorry, the mascara doesn't change the fact that I only have three eyelashes.
Why do I feel defeated...
I can no longer call myself the Mascara Shogun!
Kana-chan, for the next school club committee meeting...
Yes?
I had to resort to fake ones!
Everybody will be used to it by the last episode
Chihaya Furu
Boarding for @@ Line
Love Hunter
That hurt!
Hey! Looking like Johnny Depp
doesn't mean you shouldn't watch where you're going!
Sent him flying
Don't exaggerate. I just bumped into you.
Pull yourself together.
It may be broken...
Well, I guess I'll have to take you home then.
Good-bye, Desktomu-kun
Where do you live?
Wanna stop by the hospital?
You're awfully skinny, you know.
Wanna grab something to eat?
Episode 16
Wait for the Emperor's return
Last year's champions will now return the trophy.
This was the first trophy we worked together to win.
We have to win again
and make it to Nationals.
Our next dream is to be number one in Japan!
Group A Round 1 Mizusawa High School
Nishida Yusei Oe Kana Ayase Chihaya Komachi Tsutomu Mashima Taichi
Yeah, we want to get off to a running start.
Let's use the order Komano came up with.
Sounds good.
I think it's fine.
Oh, then I'll go turn this in.
Huh? Oh, thanks.
Tsukuba-kun?
Komano Tsutomu Tsukuba Akihiro
What do you think you're doing?!
How could you change the order?!
If you've got a problem, say something!
B-But!
I came within three cards of beating Komano-senpai once!
I've almost caught up in terms of skill!
I'm...
Cool down.
If you can't, go home.
Let's switch up the order.
For our first match against Shuryukan,
let's switch me out
for Hanano Sumire.
Huh?
Huh?
For our second match against West High,
we'll switch out Kana-chan
for Tsukuba Akihiro.
The remaining three players will have to play every game.
Mashima, Porky, Ayase...
It's on you.
Let's go, Mizusawa High School.
The night breaks to day...
May I live to see...
In the sleepy...
Uh...
Why are you giving me a chance?
Shh. You're too loud.
I said a lot of rude things.
I've been in your shoes.
I was also given a chance.
One win for Mizusawa!
Two wins for Mizusawa!
Not President Mashima...
Okay! Three wins for Mizusawa!
Not Porky...
We wouldn't be this strong, if the first-years weren't here.
Hey, Retro!
What are you thinking?!
Your projected order was completely different!
Amakasu-kun, calm down!
What are you trying to pull?!
Predictions are gonna be wrong sometimes!
Was your prediction wrong?! Well?!
Why should we use minimal energy?
What?!
Aren't we supposed to be Hokuo Academy?
Our ace against their ace.
Our number two against their number two.
Isn't that how we should win?!
Hokuo Academy is the strongest school in Tokyo!
That's what I want to show everyone!
Ms. Miyauchi?
Sorry to show up right when you're about to start.
I had the idea to make these yesterday,
and I just put on the finishing touches.
It should be easier for you to move around now.
Tasuki...
I can move now.
I don't feel as hot now.
Waves creep closer...
When the misty bridge...
She's lost two of her best cards in a row.
That boy has good sense.
Feel sorrow wash...
Retro!
Why do you always use strange motions?!
Impassionate gods...
Yes!
All four of them got it!
W-Wait!
Impassioned vows is still in play, so I was able to cover in time!
I touched the card first.
I moved around your hand to tap it from the side.
One win for Hokuo!
What?
Porky was crushed?!
Lost by 13 cards
I know that my heart...
Uh, I'm moving The hazed early left.
Is he doing this because I'm left-handed?
I'm moving The fall paddy left.
Oh, sorry. I think I'll move it back.
No, that's not what they're trying to do!
Wait until Kana-chan has received hers!
Don't send your card yet!
I'm sending The hazed early.
They got us.
Hokuo...
Huh?
The hazed early dawn light
The fall paddy
The hazed early dawn light
The fall paddy
Does this mean...
No way! What do we do? What do we do?
What am I doing...
If The hazed early is read, Chihaya will take the opponent's card!
If The fall paddy is read, I'll take the opponent's card!
We're not giving up!
Mizusawa will take three wins!
We'll be the champions!
The fall wind parts the wispy clouds
A fault...
One win for Mizusawa!
Amakasu...
Be careful, Amakasu!
There are people...
to reveal moonlight, clear and bright.
capable of clearing their minds in this situation.
The hazed early dawn light comes not from the moon
Shouldn't we wake up Ayase?
Yes, the closing ceremony's about to begin.
E-Everyone! I'm sorry!
It's all because I screwed up!
Because I lost first!
Chihaya...
Th-That was fun!
That was the most fun we've had!
Karuta Club Secrets
Treasure
We've run into a serious problem in the second season that affects all of us.
The fact that my sister
Aw, you're sweating so much
and Retro-kun are the only people we know who are dating someone!
We can't be positive that they're the only ones.
Girlfriend? I've got plenty of those.
A whole bunch They give me candy
Naturally
I-I have a bunch...
We can't trust their claims!
I have...
We already know what you're gonna say, Queen!
Besides, we spend too much time playing karuta!
Mashima probably has girls confessing to him all the time!
Why don't you go out with them?!
I'll start calling you Piggy instead of Porky
How can he treat something so important so lightly?!
Look at how heavy he is!
Yeah, but,
relationships aren't all sunshine and rainbows.
Insurmountable Wall
Yes, I know what you mean
You can tell they're experienced!
Wait, I'm grouped with Retro?
I want to go out with someone who's good at karuta.
I want to go out with someone who knows how to put on a kimono.
Just kidding <3
Well, I guess we'll be the best couple for the time being
Cough
I hope the second season has more romance
Tsukuba! Let's practice!
Yes, sir!
Oe Traditional Clothing offers lessons for putting on kimono, right?
Desktomu-kun, let's go together!
Huh?
1 Nishida Yusei 2 Oe Kana 3 Ayase Chihaya 4 Mashima Taichi 5 Tsukuba Akihiro
What?! Tsukuba's really a starter!
That's amazing!
Starter...
The group stage match-ups were drawn yesterday,
so Komano and I already came up with the order for the first round.
Why me? Isn't Komano-senpai a starter?
For the National Tournament
A month has passed since the Tokyo regional.
You've worked very hard.
In terms of skill, you're even with me.
Don't forget that our goal is to become number one in Japan!
While the two rounds in the group stage are taking place,
I'll be scouting the other top schools
to prepare for the championship bracket!
The five of you have to get us there!
Does that mean you're not playing in the group stage?!
Are you really okay with that?!
Yeah.
Though I prayed...
Porky!
What are you doing?! We've been looking for you!
The match is about to begin! Hurry!
There's no time for us to talk strategy now.
Why were you in the cafeteria?
We bought three lunches.
Oh, we'll be going with the same lineup we used in the group stage.
Playoff teams, please head inside.
Really?
So you don't want to play?
Porky!
If you're matched up against Kawabe, try to stay calm!
I don't need your help.
He's just guessing!
Hurry up.
No, I'm not...
Don't need your help...
May it be that I...
This is bad...
I can't keep up with his sporadic bursts of speed.
My arm won't move.
This Kawabe guy is really good...
Kawabe?
He's just guessing!
We won! Mizusawa won!
You're playing in the next match, right?
You're playing in the next match, right?!
You're going to join us, right?!
Desktomu-kun!
Long last we meet, only for me to leave hurriedly,
She knew to pay extra attention to Long last we meet...
She couldn't get it.
This is the West representative.
No...
She's much faster than she was that day.
She has the potential to become Queen.
Silent waves creep closer...
The storm will soon carry...
For you, I would have given up my life
Megumu?
I have to beat her.
But I have to win to make everyone happy.
I have to beat you now.
Feel sorrow wash...
I don't remember her having such a fast motion.
Megumu-chan...
Megumu-chan is me.
Stop taking cards with your speed.
She's who I'd be if someone hadn't taught me better.
Megumu, I'll secure our first win,
so you can take it easy.
Okay...
Time to attack!
Mizusawa!
Yeah!
Okay, one card!
One card!
One card at a time!
Y-Yes!
I'm treating you like a boy!
You're weaker than Megumu!
Okay, I won!
One win for First Akashi Girls'!
Rain takes longer...
No way!
Megumu even lost her Rain card?!
One win for Pizusawa!
I lost Silent and Rain.
Her speed is real.
This girl...
Ayase Chihaya...
Impassioned gods...
Got it!
Two wins for Mizusawa!
First Akashi Girls' has 2 wins...
Mizusawa has 2 wins...
Desktomu-kun!
His opponent has The sight of Mount,
while Komano has May my lonely in a luck of the draw.
There are four more dead cards...
Though my hatred has waned...
So the flower petals...
I wish I could show the people how my sleeves
It's not over yet?!
Excuse me.
It's scary.
This is the last game...
to decide the match!
Said world grants no escape
Komano, have you noticed?
There aren't any more dead cards!
The next card will decide
the game!
It's scary...
But...
I hide in the mountains, only to hear the haunting cry of a deer
I'll always have...
The sight of Mount Arima...
Desktomu-kun...
Desktomu-kun!
Mizusawa High School defeats First Akashi Girls' 3-2.
Retro-kun?
Wataya-kun...
Aren't you going to cheer them on?
Mashima and Chihaya are playing to become the best in Japan.
Goodbye then.
Shinobu-chan.
Won't you watch some of the team match?
Your presence will encourage some of the players.
I'm actually a greedy person.
Huh? We know.
Compared to becoming Queen, becoming the strongest woman in Japan,
it's much harder for us to become best in Japan together!
Let's do this!
Mi!
Zu!
Fight!
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
It's completely different.
This is the sound of a certified reader.
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
This is our grand finale!
Coach Sakurazawa's Be Grateful Speech
They might as well make a live action movie Then I would be...
It seems you all don't understand, so I'll tell you.
Over the two days, a total of 1000 students participate in the High School Championship,
but there are about 100 people who put the entire thing on.
Staff of the National Karuta Association, as well as members of the local karuta societies
and Kansai's college karuta societies
work hard on the reading, judging, setting up the tatami mats,
and preparing the cards, just for you.
What you mustn't forget is that these people are mostly Class A or High Class A players.
The top people are Grade 10, or even former Masters or Queens.
Meaning?
Put simply, if this were the High School baseball championship...
The unsung heroes are all stars
