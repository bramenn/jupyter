Fifty years earlier, falling right into a trap laid by Naraku,
Inuyasha and Kikyo ended up hating and trying to kill each other.
I broke the seal that bound Inuyasha.
And Kikyo also was resurrected through Urasue's black magic.
I think it's false that a mortal cannot understand a demon's feelings.
Afterall, I share a kinship with Inuyasha and Shippo, and even Kirara.
But I can't fathom the pain of someone who once died as Kikyo did.
Kikyo... Will the day come when the pain in yourheart subsides?
That girl...
Soul Collectors?
What are they doing here?
Don't interfere...
I don't want you!
Leave me alone!
So you wanted to die?
Or rather, you wanted to stay dead?
Who are you?
Huh?!
You are... Kikyo?
You know me?
I thought so!
So Urasue revived her, too.
I didn't realize there were others who share my fate.
Fight! My lifeless puppet soldiers!
Cover this land with dead bodies!
Just watch me, Mother!
I, Kawaramaru, shall fill this world with dead humans!
What's the matter, Inuyasha?
No mistaking it.
I smell medicinal herbs.
Medicinal herbs?
This smell is from the same medicinal herbs
used by the witch Urasue who resurrected Kikyo.
Urasue?
I don't think it's possible...
Anyway, you all wait here.
Huh?!
Inuyasha!
How can he expect us to wait?
It's only natural that we'd be concerned.
Back then...
when Kikyo was resurrected, Urasue was supposed to have died.
And yet...
What're you doing here?
What are you doing?!
Leave me alone!
No! I will not go back! Let me go!
Why you...!
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!
I knew it!
You're Urasue's soldiers.
Inuyasha!
- Inuyasha! - Are you okay?
Yeah!
These...
Look, Miroku!
Ohh!
So these are the puppets baked from human bones and graveyard soil?
But why're they here?
I dunno... But it seems like they were afterthatgirl.
Is she alive?
The smell of incense?
Yeah... The smell of medicinal herbs used by Urasue.
What does this mean?
This girl is the same as Kikyo...
a dead person revived by Urasue.
Like Kikyo? One of the dead?
It happened soon afterl began traveling with Inuyasha.
I was captured by Urasue who had stolen Kikyo's remains.
I need you!
In orderto completely resurrect Kikyo!
I was put into a tub filled with hot water that reeked of medicinal herbs.
It was a terrible experience.
Urasue was a witch who used bones and soil to revive the dead.
She tried to draw out Kikyo's soul which had transmigrated into me.
Ultimately, Urasue resurrected Kikyo...
but was destroyed by Kikyo, the very one she revived.
We've come this far following the scent of the herbs.
But we've found nothing.
No, you're wrong.
Kikyo's smell still lingers.
Lady Kikyo?
She's not around here anymore though.
Lately, a strange army of soldiers has destroyed
castles in this area one after another.
There are rumors that a demon is behind it.
These soldiers cannot be slain with swords
and even spears will not pierce through them.
And you think they're Urasue's puppet soldiers?
One thing is certain. Someone is resurrecting the puppet soldiers.
It couldn't be that Kikyo...
is manipulating Urasue's puppets?!
I don't know.
However, it's a fact that when we came upon that dead girl,
we all sensed Kikyo.
Damn it! What's going on anyway?!
Inuyasha! Where are you going?!
Where else!
I'm gonna slay whoever is controlling those puppet soldiers!
WheneverKikyo comes into the picture,
the blood goes to his head.
Oh, you're awake.
You sure you can get up?
Don't overdo it. Go back and rest.
So many meddlers.
Last night, too...those Soul Collectors.
Soul Collectors?
She should've just left me fordead.
Soul Collectors... Did you see Kikyo?
So that was Kikyo, after all.
I wondered where she went after she killed my mother.
Yourmother?
What do you mean?
There are puppet soldiers here.
There must be someone in here who's manipulating the soldiers.
Next, we'll attack this castle.
It's heavily guarded.
No one can overcome the power of our army.
It's no longer a dream that we will reign over the land.
It's all due to you, my lord.
And the puppet soldiers constructed by Enju and myself.
Where is Kikyo?!
I don't sense herpresence anywhere.
What business do you have in this castle?
So it wasn't Kikyo.
So you're the one controlling Urasue's puppet soldiers
and causing war.
This place reeks of dead men.
My name is Kawaramaru. I am Urasue's son.
What? Urasue's son?
You must be the one who was with the priestess who killed my mother.
Perfect timing.
I gathered soldiers in order to conquerthe neighboring lands.
But I shall deal with you first.
Turn him into a pile of bones!
As if I'd let ya!
Take this!
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!
The chests of those puppets are infused with miasma!
Your skin and flesh will melt!
I'll use yourbones to make me a puppet servant!
My vision's blurred...
Why you...!
Wind Scar!
Hmm...so he escaped.
Fragments of puppets from my kiln.
Puppets that Kawaramaru ordered me to make.
Kawaramaru?
I am Enju.
Urasue brought Kawaramaru and me back from the dead to serve her.
She called us her children.
So you can use hermagic?
Kawaramaru was a warriorwho died because of a vassal's betrayal.
He excelled in commanding soldiers and after he was reborn,
Urasue gave him the power to control puppet soldiers.
Before I died, I was a potter.
Kaede said that Urasue brought the dead back to life
in orderto take advantage of the powers they had while alive.
Urasue made me help her create puppet soldiers.
And she intended to make that priestess help
search forthe shards of the Sacred Jewel.
But Urasue was killed...
Then Kawaramaru began to order me to make the puppets.
I didn't want to!
I didn't want to create puppets who killed people!
But when I became weak and frail from the lack of souls,
Kawaramaru brought me souls of the dead.
I didn't want any...
ljust wanted to find peace and sleep.
And so you ran away?
Huh?
You are beautiful even though you were once dead.
Miroku!
You say you want peaceful sleep,
but shouldn't you cherish this second chance at life?
Look at the Buddha smile.
It is because he loves all life.
Miroku...
You are amazing!
No, you're wrong, Sango...Kagome.
I won't be fooled.
Well, he doesn't intend to let you go.
They've come afterher!
Shippo! Kirara!
Protect Enju!
Leave it to me! I won't let them lay a finger on her!
Stop or I'll shoot!
It's useless to talk to them.
They're lifeless clay puppets, after all.
He shattered the puppets I made!
Miroku is an unrefined monk who loves women...
But he does have spiritual powers!
Enju! We'll break up every one of these puppets!
After all, who wants to be a soldier even afterdeath!
Return to the soil and find eternal peace.
It's useless.
Kawaramaru controls several thousand more.
And...
That's...!
Kawaramaru's army is off to conquer another castle.
So many!
But we'll do it!
So promise me!
That if we win, you'll try living.
Why? For someone like me?
Hold it!
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!
Inuyasha!
That man...
The one in the blue armor... is he the general?
Yeah, so we just have to stop him!
There are too many of them.
I'll use my Wind Tunnel!
No, Miroku!
The puppets have miasma in their chests!
If you're not careful, the toxins will poison you!
Then...sacred sutras!
Why you...! Move!
Blades of Blood!
It's useless!
Inuyasha!
Miroku!
Fool! What're you doing?!
Run Kagome!
Sango, you too!
Yourprotective mask won't work against this poison!
Kirara!
Take Kagome!
Leave it to me!
Transform!
Damn it! Here I am fighting with my wits!
- Couldn't you tell?! - Sorry!
So... The one with Sango is thatgirl from earlier?
Yes.
Enju was the one who created the puppet soldiers.
But she ran away.
She didn't want to make any more killing machines.
After she made so many! And only now she's sick of it?
Isn't that convenient?!
Inuyasha!
Kill me. That's what I've wanted all along.
That's why I ran away from you.
Enju.
We are the reborn dead.
There is no place on earth forus!
Don't make me laugh!
Then why were we resurrected?!
Was it just Mother's whim?
Why won't you help me, Enju?!
If we exterminate the living,
you can find peace as a reborn dead!
Don't you understand why Enju tried to die all alone?!
She doesn't want you to kill anymore!
You the living would neverunderstand what we feel!
Damn! Fools like you are better off dead!
Don't kid yourself!
We have been reborn!
We'll do as we please!
Arise from the depths of the earth!
Demon of Hell!
Oh, Demon of Hell... Awakened with the secret magic of my mother!
Destroy them!
Just try it!
Inuyasha!
He'll squeeze the life out of you!
I'll use my Wind Tunnel!
Get away from there!
Don't meddle, Miroku!
I'll take care of him!
Get back!
- Kagome! - Right!
Enju!
Unforgivable! How dare you play around with human souls!
Take this!
W-What...!
The power of the Wind Scar
blasted the miasma and Kawaramaru into ashes.
Kawaramaru...
You sure this is okay?
Uh-huh...
Even we don't know why we were born, yet we live.
That's why it's interesting.
No telling what tomorrow will bring.
Say... I wonderhow she's doing?
She's probably feeding a fire.
Kikyo bade you to come?
I promised Kagome... to give life a chance.
Give life a chance, huh?
Why are villagers coming after Miroku?
Knowing Miroku, he probably made trouble long ago.
Still, they were awfully angry.
I have no idea what it is.
But there's no sense in brooding over it.
You were in so many fixes, you can't remember which is which!
Everyone, I think you misunderstand me.
Next on Inuyasha: The Mysterious, Lecherous Monk!
Well then, let's get to the bottom of this!
