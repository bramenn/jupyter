Here she comes, Reiner.
Right.
Oh no...
Eren's being taken away!
All squads! Let the Titans chase after you!
Follow my lead!
Erwin...
You demon! Are you trying to use us as bait again?!
That's not my intention!
The Military Police have fought well!
Now serve your duty as soldiers!
The Armored Titan plans to escape with Eren!
We have to stop him no matter what!
Charge
He's not fast enough to escape! We'll catch up!
This time, I won't hesitate. I'll kill them both, I swear!
And if Ymir gets in my way, she's asking for it, too.
No matter what it takes... I will!
Christa!
Ymir...
Ymir!
Chris-
No... Historia. Sorry... for eating you... like that.
I bet... you're mad at me.
Ymir...
What is this? What are you doing?
We came here to rescue you and Er-
I don't need rescuing!
Just stay right there.
I'm following Reiner and Bertholdt now.
You, too. Come with me.
There's no future within the walls!
Listen to me, Historia...
Outside the walls isn't as bad as you think.
Especially... because there won't be anyone saying that
you're better off not being born.
I'm pretty sure Titans won't be saying that to me...
Everyone has at least one or two faults!
If you can just overlook that, they're not so bad after all!
Ymir! Everything you're saying and doing isn't making any sense!
Could it be... that Reiner and Bertholdt threatened you?
It's... the reverse.
Am I right, Ymir?!
I'll fight them with you, so let me out of your hand!
I don't care if there's something you can't tell me.
No matter what happens...
Ymir!
Look...
The Scouts have already gotten this close.
If only we had run right away, we probably would've been able to escape.
But because you forced us to bring Christa... at this rate, they'll catch us!
Hey, Ymir... are you telling us we did all of that for nothing?
Did you change your mind?
Is that really what you want? Letting Christa rot within the walls?
Don't be stupid! Ymir!
Ymir! Hurry up and let me go!
I can't!
Historia...
To be honest...
Huh?
A long time ago, I stole the Power of the Titans from one of their comrades.
There's nothing I can do against them.
Sooner or later, they'll kill me.
But... if I hand you over and cooperate with them...
and try to make it so my crime goes away.
Because you know the secrets of the wall, you're someone important to the Church.
Does it...
Yeah, it does.
Once this world started going to hell...
I almost died during the battle at that castle...
I'm afraid to die...
I'll do whatever it takes to live...
I'm pathetic...
I told myself I was doing it for your sake...
But really, I did it for myself.
Please, Historia...
Please...
Please save me!
I told you already, Ymir.
No matter what happens... I will always be your ally!
Reiner! Protect us!
I knew it! I'll have to kill Ymir first!
Wait, Mikasa!
Don't kill Ymir!
That all depends on Ymir!
What will it be? I'll kill everyone that gets in my way, so choose!
No, wait!
Ymir will be killed unless she does what Reiner and Bertholdt say!
She doesn't have a choice!
There's only so many lives that I actually care about.
My enemies made deciding that easy six years ago.
So... you're mistaken to seek any compassion from me.
Because right now, I'm all out of time and room in my heart to care.
Christa... do you pick Eren or Ymir? Which is it?
Will you get in my way, too?!
Stop, Ymir!
Don't fight back! You'll die!
Don't move!
Quit it, Eren!
Don't struggle!
Good luck with that, Bertholdt.
It's impossible to get him to calm down.
He's the most irritating guy there is!
I know better than anyone!
I hate him as much as you do.
So let's beat him up together.
Why don't you come out of there?
Bertholdt! Give him back!
Hey... You're kidding, right? Bertholdt? Reiner?
This whole time... you kept quiet and deceived us?
That's so cruel!
You guys! Tell us it's all a lie!
Hey, hey, hey... You think you can just keep running away?
That's not gonna happen!
For three years, didn't we sleep under the same roof
as comrades through thick and thin?
Bertholdt... Your odd sleeping positions were truly an art form.
After a while, we all looked forward each morning to seeing your pose...
But you...
To think you, the invader... could sleep like a log...
Was everything just a lie?
Remember we talked about surviving this together?
And that we'd grow old, and someday we'd all go out for drinks together?
Was everything... all a lie?
Was it?!
You guys...
What were you guys thinking this whole time?
What's it even matter anymore?
Just focus on cutting open his neck.
If you hesitate for a moment, we won't be able to get Eren back.
They are enemies of humanity.
That's all there is to know.
T-Tell me who!
Who the hell would want to kill people by their own choice?!
Who the hell would like doing this sort of thing?!
Do you think I wanted to do this?!
People hate and despise us...
We've done such terrible things, we deserve to die.
Things we'll never be able to take back...
But... we just... couldn't come to terms with our sins.
The only time we had some respite... was when we pretended to be soldiers.
That's not a lie!
Conny! Jean! It's true we may have deceived everyone, but it's not all a lie!
We really considered you comrades!
Neither of us have any right to even apologize.
But... someone...
Please...
Someone, please...
Someone find us!
Bertholdt...
Give Eren back.
It's no use... I can't.
Someone has to be the one to do it.
Someone has to be the one to stain their hands with blood.
You guys!
Get away from there!
I can't believe him...
What the hell is that Erwin thinking?
He's leading a horde of Titans this way!
Information Available for Public Disclosure Special Titan Powers
Among the Titans, there are those with special powers. The intense, high temperature steam of the Colossal Titan and the hardened skin of the Armored Titan are prime examples. It remains unknown how they possess such abilities.
You guys! Jump and get outta there!
All soldiers, disperse!
Get far away from the Titans!
Historia!
What's going on?
Is this hell?
No... but it will be!
All soldiers, charge!
The fate of humanity will be determined in this very moment!
There is no future where humanity can inhabit these lands without Eren!
We recover Eren and immediately retreat!
Give your hearts!
Mikasa!
Those crazy Scouts.
Something's wrong with their heads.
Hey!
Huh?
What's happening out there?
What the hell's going on?
I can't move...
Unless I tear these Titans off me, it'll only get worse.
In that case...
Brace yourself, Bertholdt!
A little more...
Just a little more!
It worked!
His hand's gone!
Now's our chance!
Hey, Mikasa?! Can't you see all those Titans?!
How do you plan on getting through that mess?
You'd have to slip through a horde of'em.
Advance!
Commander Erwin!
Advance!
Eren is just ahead!
Advance!
Right!
Mikasa!
You piece of shit!
Let her go!
We've come this far already.
We're taking Eren home with us.
We're going back to our hometown.
Shit... This is all because I got caught.
Everyone's gonna die because of me.
Bertholdt!
Armin?!
Those who can't abandon anything...
Advance!
What is it?
What do I have to abandon?
Is it my life?
Or something else?
Are you two okay with this?
Leaving behind your comrade and returning home?
You're abandoning Annie?
You know where she's at?
Far north, deep underground in the Utopia District... and being tortured.
It was her screams that taught us something.
That even with her body's healing, you can never get rid of the pain.
They're taking special care to ensure she doesn't die.
And as we speak, they're not giving her body any rest.
They're torturing her every way they know how.
You spawn of the devil!
I'll pulverize you!
All soldiers, retreat!
I did it.
My first kill.
Ymir...
Christa!
What the hell are you doing?! We're leaving!
Let's hurry home and chow down!
Conny! Sasha! Leave me be!
Lemme go!
Huh?
Ymir said if I don't go with her, Reiner and Bertholdt are going to kill her!
If she hands me in, they'll let her go free!
We were gonna go with them!
What the heck? Ymir said that?
Yes, so let me down!
It's a lie! Of course that's a lie! She's lying to you!
Sasha is right.
You think the one who fought like
a maniac to save you would do something like that?
The only time Ymir ever shows some effort is when you're in trouble.
I don't know about her getting killed, but...
For now, just calm down.
That's right!
If you two stay here any longer,
there's a huge chance that you'll die and it'll only get worse!
You know, even an idiot could figure that out.
Damn that Reiner!
He's tossing Titans like a madman!
Eren! Mikasa!
Eren...
Eren encounters the very Titan that devoured his mother.
Unable to move his body, Hannes steps in to protect him.
What is the enemy? What is the war?
Not knowing what to brandish their swords against, the Scouts battle on.
Where will they ever find the future that they pursue?
