Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
That's why I told you not to ease up
on your Spiritual Pressure.
So it's over
How boring.
Do you want to fight?
Do you want to win?
Or do you wantto live?
Which is it?
I want to win.
I cannot hear you.
There's no meaning in just fighting.
Just surviving has no meaning.
I want to win. I
want to win!
Fine.
Then I shall take you.
This is?!
What are you doing?
B-But unless I do this, I'll fall again!
You needn't worry about that.
Back then, your Hollow transformation made this inner world lose its stability.
That's why it happened. But it's different this time.
Take a look.
Even amidst the fierce fighting, your inner world does not even quiver.
Hold it hold it
Are you saying that my mind is normally in this up-down-sideways state?!
It seems you have grown a bit stronger.
Wowtotally ignoring me, huh?
Stand, Ichigo!
Hey, that's dangerous!
Who'd throw an unsheathed sword like that?!
Hang on to it. It's your sword.
Huh?
But this isyouI mean Zangetsu
Asauchi
It is a nameless Zanpaku-to wielded by a low-ranking Soul Reaper
who was unable to join Squad 13.
Yeahbut my Zanpaku-to is Zangetsu.
Zangetsu
the one that was broken by your opponent earlier?
This one?
I cannot give this to you!
Wha-?!
What're you doing?!
Get outta the way!
W-Who are you?!
Aw c'mon, you know me, partner.
From now, we will test whether you deserve to wield me.
If you wish to hold me once more, take me away with your own hand!
Your enemy is yourself.
Sounds good.
Do it, partner!
That is
if you can!
I can't counter him!
Amazing!
I didn't know Zangetsu was such an amazing sword!
The atmosphere's nearly burning away from the spiritual aura.
It's like a monster!
The usual Zanpaku-to seems like a wooden stick compared to it!
What can I do with something like this?!
Dammit!
What's the matter, partner?
If you just stand around,
I'll kill you!
What?!
Sheesh, missed
He swings the Zangetsu with the cloth wrapping from the hilt
What's with this fighting-style?
I never even thought of something like that!
You had this awesome sword, so how could you get bloodied like that?
I can't understand it.
Can you become a friend with someone you just met,
simply by asking his name?
What?
Because that's what you're doing!
You think you've mastered Zangetsu just by calling its name.
You're so full of yourself
You don't even try to draw out its full power or try to understand it!
You believe that as long as you train yourself,
you'll get stronger!
He's right.
I didn't even try to understand that Zangetsu.
The Zanpaku-to isn't a tool
Each one of them has a name, they're alive.
And yet
My Zanpaku-to doesn't have a name. This is its true form.
Oh yeah? I'm relieved.
Then I guess that means your sword won't get any stronger.
Relieved, what a joke!
Cut the crap!
I'm no different.
As it is, I'm no different from that bastard
who didn't care about his Zanpaku-to's name.
I want to know
Now then, let's end this.
I'll show you what it means to master Zangetsu.
To you, who could never master it until death!
Show me, old man Zangetsu
Even a little at a timeabout you
I want to know about you, the source of my strength.
And let me
once more
fight with you!
You're giving me one more chance?
Thank you, old man.
He's gone.
Oh well.
Was that good enough?
Yes, thanks for coming.
Don't mention it.
After all, he is the king of this world.
He has to win.
Well, I'm done here, right? Let me go back.
Yes.
He's strong Zangetsu.
Nurture him well.
That power is going to be mine eventually.
Ichigo
I hate the rain.
And it rains in this world, too.
If your heart is troubled, the skies will become cloudy.
If you grieve, it will rain ever so easily.
I wonder if you can understand
The fear of being rained upon in this lonely world.
To stop that rain, I shall lend you any strength.
If you have faith in me,
I will not allow any rain to fall upon this world.
Ichigo, trust me. You are not fighting alone.
What?! That kid's pulse which had disappeared is
And this Spiritual Pressure
His bleeding
has stopped!
I can't push down
Sorry, but I don't have time here.
I'm gonna end this quickly.
End it quickly, huh?
Can't allow that.
Not after
it's gotten so much fun!
I love it!
How come you revived?
How come you're suddenly much stronger?
I've got a bunch of questions bothering me!
But forget them for now!
Let's just have fun with this fight!
Dammit! I'm the one charging!
So how come he won't go down?!
This isn't right! Something's wrong with you!
You love fighting that much?
Aren't you afraid of being cut, of dying?!
Something's wrong with me? Somethings wrong with YOU!
You're so strong, why don't you love fighting?!
Enjoy it! Relish in death, in pain!
Isn't that the price we pay?!
What is going on?
W-Who are you?! Yumichika?!
Hey! So long!
No!
Was it the explosion?! The fireworks made it like that?
Don't laugh! Fine, I'll put this on!
What?
I was just thinking that the Captain seems to be having fun.
You're right. Who's his opponent?
His strength is amazing.
It's Ichigo. That kid has gotten stronger from the time we fought.
He's like a different person.
Maybe Captain is on the defensive?
This is bad. Even the Captain might
Fool! No way he'd lose!
This is the ultimate! A draw!
No, it's just slight, but you're better.
Since whenhave I felt such elation?!
How comehe's going easy?
I think, with you
I can fight with all my might!
Lieutenant Kusajishi, I have an urgent message!
Yes, later
Huh? But this is a Level 1 missive
signed by both Head Captain Yamamoto and Captain Hitsugaya of Squad 10.
Hmmthen, later.
Lieutenant, please!
I was ordered to deliver this message to everyone immediately, sir!
Shut up!
Kenpachi is fighting. So don't bother me!
What the hell?!
The moment he removed his eye patch, his Spiritual Pressure jumped up!
That's dirty! You have another trick after fighting this long?
What're you hiding in that right eye?!
Hiding? In my right eye? ! As if I'd stoop to such a low trick.
I asked Technological Development to make this,
a monster that consumes spiritual energy.
I'm gonna pump it all out all this spiritual energy
in order to kill you.
That's all it is.
Can you hear it, Ichigo? The cries of his sword?
Yeah
He cannot hear it.
When two who do not trust each other fight,
they only destroy each other.
And one who only believes in himself cannot understand this.
Ichigo, can you trust me?
That goes without saying.
I'm putting all my power in your hands.
Do what you will with it.
And lend me your power!
Yes.
Oh After all this time, your Spiritual Pressure still increases?
This is fun.
Of course, it increases.
I'm borrowing Zangetsu's power and fighting alongside him.
I will never lose to someone like you who only fights alone!
Zangetsu? Is that the name of that Zanpaku-to?
Borrowing the power of your Zanpaku-to and fighting alongside it
Nonsense!
Zanpaku-to are mere tools for fighting.
That's the line of a weakling
who has no confidence in his own strength,
so he borrows the power of the Zanpaku-to!
And that is
not my line, Ichigo!
He's coming, Ichigo!
I'm near the limit of my ability to stop the flow of your bleeding.
We will finish this in one blow.
Sorryeveryone
Happy people
Come on, come on, come on
Happy people
Here we go!
Everybody stand up! Everybody fight!
Within your heart, you may feel uneasy
But keep your head right up!
To the sky!
No matter when (Oh yeah!)
No matter where (Oh yeah!)
Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!)
Ill be here for you
Happy people in the house!!!
With a tough smile
Happy people in the house!!!
Lets live!
Wow
