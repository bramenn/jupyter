What is it?! A fire?
Slaying of demons.
- Smells awful! - What's all this smoke?
Got that? Send them this way!
Like we're getting rid of insects.
Sango, are you about ready?
Is this one of the demons?
Inuyasha's nose is awfully sensitive.
How beautiful!
Hey Miroku! Where're you goin'?
It's coming! Get back!
Kagome! It's all right now.
Inuyasha, do you still feel sick?
Huh? Where's Miroku?
He went after some strange woman.
W-what?! While we were working?
She was awfully pretty.
He probably went and asked her to have his baby.
Huh?! A b-baby?!
I see... so you are the princess of a very prominent clan.
But my clan was ruined by war.
And I am the last survivor of my House.
In order to restore my family...
I wish to bear the child of a strong lord.
And you sought me out?
Such fine taste.
Will you heed my request?
I thought it was too good to be true.
Giant mantis...
disguised as a woman!
I devoured the insides of the real one!
You picked the wrong victim!
Wind Tunnel!
Damn! My Wind Tunnel got nicked!
I don't know if I'm imagining it...
but the girls have been looking at me quite coldly.
Didn't you just go to pick up a woman?
That's why they think you're a lecher.
I'm so misunderstood.
You may not believe me...
- We don't. - You're lying.
I wish you'd hear me out at least.
Shucks... It still hurts.
That praying mantis made my Wind Tunnel bigger.
Father!
Do not go! Miroku!
Father! Father!
Let me go, Master Priest!
You will be sucked into your father's Wind Tunnel, too!
Father!
He went out before dawn?!
Yes, the monk said that he was going on a journey...
and to wish you well.
That Miroku! Always acting on his own!
My father got sucked into his own Wind Tunnel...
and disappeared without leaving a trace.
In time, I probably will end up dying like that.
Miroku, I can see it!
W-what's this giant hole?
This?
This is my father's grave.
Master Mushin, are you there? It's Miroku!
Cripes... drunk as usual.
Wake up!
You drunken monk!
Oh, it's you, Miroku. So you're still alive?
Master Mushin, if you keep drinking to excess...
you won't live long.
Did you come here to lecture me?!
Well... A demon nicked my Wind Tunnel.
Will you repair it?
Let me see...
Huh?!
You will die tonight!
Not! Just joking!
Do you want to be sucked in?!
Now, now... Calm down.
I'll stitch it up, but I must warn you.
Until the wound is completely healed...
you cannot expose your Wind Tunnel.
And if I do?
The Wind Tunnel will spread from the nicks...
and hasten your death.
I will no longer be able to help you.
Now then...
I will get my medicinal herbs.
Go and thoroughly purify your dirty self.
Hmm... So that Master Mushin is the one who raised you?
Yeah... Everything bad, I learned from him.
He acts gruff, but he seems very kind.
I guess.
That Miroku... Going timid over little nicks like that.
Well, I can't blame him.
He's had such a tragic life.
Why did Miroku leave us like that?
Isn't it'cuz you treated him so coldly yesterday?
Huh?!
Err... Master Inuyasha...
Old Myoga? You're here?
Yes.
Actually, I returned last night.
And the monk was acting strangely.
Whaddya mean?
He kept staring at his right hand and seemed deep in thought.
I'm not sure what he was thinking about...
Inuyasha, let's find Miroku.
Huh? Did something happen?
Yes... but we're not sure what.
Find him? But how!
Well...
Leave'im alone!
Finding the Sacred Jewel fragments is more important!
Miroku...what happened?
It's still day, but unusually dark.
W-who are you?!
Did you take your medicine?
Yeah.
I feel quite groggy.
Sleep.
It'll be over soon.
I'm counting on you. Frankly, I don't want to die...
Difficult you're not. I'll put you at ease soon.
What is this?
I don't like it.
Inuyasha!
Naraku's toxic insects!
Hiraikotsu!
This time, it's dead!
Wait!
If he's keeping us under surveillance...
something must've happened to Miroku!
I'm following it!
- Okay! - Hey wait!
Oh... are you still awake?
W-who... are you?!
In exchange for a fragment of the Sacred Jewel...
I promised Naraku to kill you...
I'm the Demon Worm Charmer.
Naraku?
You can't move anymore.
The medicine has numbed your body.
Go in peace!
Miroku!
My staff!
Err... Umm...
I won't let you get away!
Hurry and save yourself!
Look well... the demons are gathering.
Huh?!
If you stay with me, you'll die.
Master Miroku!
Just go!
I can ward them off until the medicine wears off.
B-but!
Just do as I say!
Alright!
He talked big, bu no way he can handle it alone!
Inuyasha must be close by!
This is our only clue.
Don't lose it!
What?!
Help!
You're!
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!
I fool around with a woman and have to pay with my life...
Such is my fate.
So this is it.
Miroku is in danger, after all!
He can't use his Wind Tunnel right now!
Can't use it?
His Wind Tunnel got nicked.
Before the monk became weird he was saying...
if Miroku used his Wind Tunnel...
the nicks would allow the hole to spread wider...
shortening his life, which is already short.
There's the temple!
Go right through'em all, Tanuki!
waste my time here!
If you want to eat me, go ahead.
Unlike someone else, I accept death with grace.
I won't go fighting, like Inuyasha.
Miroku!
So this is where you've been hiding!
Inuyasha... you've come for me!
Miroku, you are!
Miroku!
Miroku!
Idiot! Why did you disappear without a word?!
How could you?!
We worried so much!
So you're okay, Monk?
I see...they are all here.
Inuyasha, say something!
Huh?
Never mind!
You said everything I meant to say.
Who goes there?!
I shall punish anyone who disturbs the peace of my temple!
Are you the monk called Mushin?
Interesting... fight me if you dare.
Inuyasha... please... don't kill him!
Good boy! After all, I am the one who raised Miroku.
Who cares about that?!
Prepare yourself, you old monk!
Tetsusaiga's transformation was thwarted!
Iron-Reaver, Soul-Stealer!
Feisty boy...
Damn! What's going on?!
You are bound by my special magic, yet you can still move?
But I wonder how long you can last?
W-what's that... coming out of the monk's mouth!?
Demon Worms!
Old Myoga!
The monk is controlled by that.
Can't he be saved?
There must be a Demon Worm Charmer nearby.
Find him and take the pot away and aim it at the monk.
The Demon Worm will leave him and return to the pot.
All right. Let's search, Old Myoga!
What?! Me too?
Kagome! What's going on?!
The demons aren't decreasing.
Inuyasha's in danger too.
Sango, I'm glad you're here!
Old Myoga!
Feel safer over there?
Err... no...
Kagome, look!
There's no mistake! That's the one!
- He got away! - Let's go after him!
These sutra beads are draining my strength...
Damn!
I'm starting to feel weak.
You no longer have the power to fight back the swarm.
Do you wish to be devoured alive?
I shall be benevolent and chop off your head first.
Those are scum demons that have no taste.
Scum demons devour only scum!
Don't get your hopes too high, stinkin' monk!
Die!
Only I can cure him.
I am the only one who can repair Miroku's Wind Tunnel.
Left as is, he might all be sucked into it tomorrow.
Resign yourself!
Everyone in this temple will soon die!
Miroku!
You can move now!
The Wind Tunnel!
Hachi... prepare yourself.
You and I will probably be sucked in.
Rather than be eaten the their likes...
this is much better!
Huh?!
Yes sir! I'll follow you, Master Miroku!
Here goes!
Wind Tunnel!
Hachi! Support me!
Yes sir!
Miroku!
The fool!
He'll suck in the Sacred Jewel fragment!
He's losing strength!
Go to sleep!
I can't hold my place!
Inu... yasha!
Damn it! If you try to open your Wind Tunnel again...
I'll break this arm!
You can die if you wanna!
But don't die so easily when you're with me!
Feeling guilty of abandoning you...
isn't something I'll enjoy...
W-what?!
The demons have all been...
blown away!
What just happened?!
Huh?
The true power of the Tetsusaiga...
for the first time!
You won't get away!
It's all right now.
He's taking so long.
He has to stitch the wound. It takes time.
Fool... being so reckless.
Monk! How is Miroku!
He's asleep.
You there... Inuyasha?
Come with me.
Hey Monk...
I hope you did a good job stitching up the Wind Tunnel.
I did what I could, but the Wind Tunnel had spread further.
You mean his life is shortened?!
How much longer does he have?
I don't know.
Miroku's Wind Tunnel was created...
by a curse placed upon him by Naraku the demon.
Hence, if Naraku is destroyed...
the curse is lifted and Miroku's life will be spared.
The sooner you get him, the better. That is the only way.
He's very strong-willed.
How can he always be so cheerful?
Hmm...
I'm sure that actually...
he worries about each and every day.
- Huh? He's awake! - Miroku!
You'll be all right. The monk stitched the Wind Tunnel.
Anything wrong with your hand?
Master Miroku...
Committing sexual harrassment even now?!
He ain't gonna die for a long time.
The Miroku blood is to be feared!
Sango had a younger brother, Kohaku.
He passed away when he was caught in Naraku's plot.
It's so sad to hear that the scar on her back is a reminder of her brother.
Inuyasha is attacked by a chain scythe! Sango gets tense!
Could the boy who throws the chain scythe be?
But... How?
Next on Inuyasha: Sango's Suffering and Kohaku's Life.
Look forward to it!
