Bring it on!
The part...
It's responding...
The time... has begun?!
Chaos...
The eternal midnight...
Let me hear your voice...
Who are you?
Tell me...
Who are you?!
You did a fine job, Kanaloa. Now rest for the time being.
What the...?! The octopus shrank!
Down to bite-size... It looks yummy!
Are you a demon?!
The Time Has Begun!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
It's nullified?!
So magic doesn't work...
Nullified, my ass! That doesn't matter!
Bastard!
We can't beat him like that!
Gate of the Goat, I open thee!
It's useless.
What...?!
I can nullify all forms of magic.
That's my magic.
That's not fair!
That's no different than when we were in Edolas!
Pain in the ass!
Natsu!
Natsu-nii!
This is nothin'!
I scrap with Gray all year'round, so I'm used to it!
This kind of fight...
Oh, no! I overslept!
Whew, boy...
In my dream, even Titania confessed her love for me...
Happy!
Aye, sir!
What a pain...
He even cancelled my ability to fly.
Figured it wouldn't work...
You figured?!
I told you I nullify everything.
Do you listen when someone's talking to you?
If we can't use magic, we can't do anything!
There has to be some way!
Natsu! How are you gonna attack?
I just thought of somethin' awesome!
When we first split up, Gildarts was using magic, right?!
Then if I beat him without magic,
it'll be like I beat Gildarts!
Yeah! I'm all fired up!
For better or worse, you are positive, Natsu.
Even though I told you that the fate of the world is at stake,
all you care about is winning or losing for yourself...
What's wrong with that?!
The weight that we bear on our shoulders is different from yours.
We're prepared to throw away our lives for the sake of our duty.
We're back to that again?
Take a good look, Coco.
He's our enemy, but he's got guts.
The real fight is just about to start.
Hot! This is totally hot!
Right, Salamander and you brats?!
Anyway, I'm just lookin' forward to a totally hot battle with you doin' your best.
What happened to me?!
You fainted from anemia. You just need to rest a while.
That's not true.
It has something to do with the magic spell I was under, doesn't it?
No matter how hard I try, I can't remember any of the time when I was a snake.
But...
Would I be able to stay here?
You were turned into a snake?!
Yeah.
Although I don't remember anything from then...
I just remember one thing, that my friend made me a promise.
A promise?
That even if we were separated,
he would ride a shooting star to come and get me someday.
What the hell is that?!
Master, that girl...
She's the snake that was hanging around before.
The snake showed signs of being put under a curse...
And when you lifted the curse, it was really a girl, huh?
Except it was a powerful spell, and I couldn't detect its purpose...
Even now, her condition is unstable.
So if she remembers...?
Which is why I took her in, so we can keep an eye on her...
Meddling old man! Yeesh!
A voice that only she can hear...
With apologies to Kinana, when her memories of being a snake do return,
it may not be something to celebrate.
Poor kid...
So her memories may prove poisonous, huh?
Well, we'll all watch over her, won't we?
Curse, shmurse! You've got nothin' to worry about now!
'Cause no matter what happens, we'll protect you.
So just hush up and get some rest.
No...
Did you just hear something?
No...
Prepared to throw your lives away for some duty, ya say?
What a bunch of crap!
Lives aren't meant to be tossed away like garbage!
We're fightin' because of a friend.
And'cause of our bond, we can overcome anything.
Friends ain't some tools that you use!
And they ain't somethin' you can just throw away!
That's what life's about!
How many hits has he taken?
But wait... wait and see...
Those eyes don't look anywhere close to giving in.
Everyone... Don't even think of gettin' in on this...
I'm takin' this guy down.
As a Fairy Tail wizard, I swear I'll take him...
Natsu-nii!
At last, he can't even stand...
Even so, Natsu won't look down.
I'm sure... he'll look ahead!
Even though he's the enemy, kudos to him!
I don't understand...
Dan-san, is that...
Look at that hideous face...
What?!
He got him!
A weak blow...
How peculiar.
When I look at you, a feeling long forgotten comes to the fore.
Is it fury?
For your friend, life...
Even though you seem to speak sense,
in the end, you people are guild wizards.
You lot take on jobs for the money,
so for you to mock our noble mission... It's preposterous!
What's that?! Who does it for the money?!
Don't insult the guild!
Rent...?
Gulp!
Food expenses...?
Nee-san, tell him off!
Um... Uh...
I didn't think he'd hit the nail on the head...
You're still talkin' nonsense...
In the first place, you bastards are the ones who stole from Lucy...
Even without the Infinity Clock in operation,
chaos is already loose in this world.
However...
Zentopia teaches us to display proper behavior even as we monitor the chaos.
Turning that path into action is the duty of Legion.
Is that right? Then you're clueless, too!
He's suddenly full of energy...
I wonder why...
Look at that!
Crypt candles?!
They're all over the place.
You ate the sacred flames of the crypt?! How blasphemous can you get?!
I thought you were gonna keep preachin', Octo-man.
Although that kinda talk just goes in one ear and out the other...
All that stuck is friend and lives.
And now I'm gonna pay you back 100-fold for insulting the guild!
He's provoking him.
Even though he doesn't need to go to the trouble of making him angry...
That's Natsu for you.
Awesome...
I can hear it...
I can hear it!
The end is in our hands!
The end is in our hands!
The end is in our hands!
What is His Grace's condition?
Actually...
It can't be helped...
Shall we assemble the cardinals?
To elect the next archbishop?!
What are you saying?!
Cardinal Rapowant!
You're back?!
You speak of foolishness such as replacing the archbishop.
Realize that we are facing a much bigger problem.
What is it?!
There is a traitor within Zentopia.
He tarnishes our history,
spills information about the Infinity Clock...
But that's not all.
The attacks on the provincial diocese...
I've heard it was abetted by someone on the inside.
How...?!
I can't believe it!
Do I have a reason to lie?
No...
No, of course not!
I'm suspicious of the priest who survived the attack that time.
I would like to question him directly. Bring him here.
Yes, sir!
I'll look after the archbishop.
From now, no one shall enter his bedchamber.
This is a crusade.
Retrieving the Infinity Clock...
That is Legion's holy mission.
A guild's principles can't compare.
If you make magic by eating fire, I can nullify that, too.
You... bastard...
That's playing dirty!
Fight fair and square!
But he...
Byro-sama has never used attacking magic?
Coco, I think you already know this,
but Byro-sama's combat technique
is among the five strongest in all of Fiore.
The weak have no right to control this world.
What?!
The weak...
We aren't doing anything wrong.
People can't survive without something to rely on.
Take Zentopia. It's only natural to depend on it.
Therefore, if His Grace tells us to search for the clock, we'll look until we find it!
And if being scrupulous about the methods means not being able to find it,
then we have no choice.
You see,
that's our mission.
I don't get it.
Neither do I, but you're definitely wrong!
That's right!
Haven't you thought about all the people who are going to suffer because of your mission?!
It's foolish to act upon your emotions.
To provide the correct path and to follow the correct path,
we are forced to make hard choices!
The world is always full of contradictions.
I have the sense to know that at least.
Therefore, it's natural that at the end of the path I choose, there will be sacrifices.
Uh-oh. The cryptex in my head got all scrambled.
Make hard choices?
But it must be easy for you.
What?
You don't decide by emotions, but by following your cause, right?
If it doesn't prick your conscience,
anyone could easily make those choices, right?
Michelle...
Sorry, but could you explain what everyone's talking about,
Lu-pi?
Do you contest the whole concept of a rightful cause?
Watch out!
What kind of rightful cause makes people sad and suffer?!
In Edolas, we saw a lot of people suffering
and Exceeds going through hardships!
A path that forces you to cause people pain and sacrifice them along the way
is one that'll eventually fall to pieces and disappear!
Is that the way you want everyone to go?!
Even a fish is free to swim wherever it wants in the water, right?!
Well, we're the same!
We take requests from people who are in trouble and help them,
so they can be happy and we get a reward.
That's how we've been operating all along. That's what a guild does!
Against you and that fake righteousness you hold over your head,
Fairy Tail isn't gonna be beat!
Fake righteousness?!
You... Your ridicule of me...
No, your ridicule of Zentopia knows no bounds!
Rightful cause, my butt! You should be ashamed!
Happy... Well said.
That's right. Our guild isn't built on logic.
We act to protect our honor.
You spout nonsense! And for that you shall receive Heaven's punishment!
Not if I can help it!
No, you two!
Don't!
That glow... Don't tell me...
Divine Arrow!
If he uses that against people...
Return to dust.
Burn in the flames of your own sins... and be purified!
Divine Arrow!
It missed?!
Coco!
What are you doing?!
That's a 0, Byro-sama! Please, stop this!
The path of righteousness for Legion... for all Zentopia...
We have power.
Isn't the righteous path the one where we guide the powerless lambs?!
Going down the path that sacrifices people...
I can't...
I can no longer accept that contradiction!
Coco...
Would you turn your back on the faith?!
I know what my fate will be for betraying Legion.
But I can't see what lies at the end of our righteous path anymore!
Righteousness is a straight arrow!
It pierces everything, leading to the truth in a straight line!
I know you haven't forgotten that precept!
If that arrow sacrifices many powerless lambs along the way,
then it should be broken!
Byro-sama...
I realized something.
Our doctrine isn't everything to me.
Watching what these people do touched me...
They're so nice and look like they have so much fun...
I'm sure you'll feel it too, Byro-sama.
If you face these people with your heart...
Coco...
Have you been poisoned?! You traitor!
Coco...
I won't even wait for the hearing!
You'll be judged right here, Coco!
Coco!!
Thank you, Princess.
You...
Last time, we didn't have a chance to cross swords,
but we finally meet, Byro Cracy.
Titania...
Don't Titania me!
Aiming an attack at your comrade in a fit of rage...
It makes me sick!
Erza!
Hey, you don't bully the weak!
Gray! Juvia!
Huh? Why Lyon?
Jeez...
I had a hunch there was trouble, so we hustled on over here...
And look what we've got.
Shut up!
The real fight was just about to start and then you waltz in!
Everyone! You all found the parts of the clock!
Gajeel is here?!
Carla's team found a part, too!
Look, everyone! There's the one we found!
As you can see,
we've obtained all five parts.
All that's left is the clock hand you people stole from Lucy.
And you will give it back.
If you want it, come and get it, Titania.
You stand against all of us?
We're going to seal away all the parts of the clock and keep them safe.
So just give that to me without protest.
I can't do that.
The Infinity Clock originally belonged to Zentopia.
We're bound to take charge of it.
Oh?
Is that right?
Um... This is the first I've heard...
You're all in too deep.
You peered at the darkness that mustn't be seen.
Already, I cannot allow you to leave here alive!
Balderdash!
Let's go!
Everyone, wait! Magic doesn't work...
Hey!
Pitiful.
So this is what that guy was talking about!
Even against our numbers...
Magic doesn't work on him!
Who knew he was this strong?
For sure, this is a pain in the ass...
Right? Now it's like I'm just a normal cat!
No matter how many of you attack at once, it makes no difference.
Against me, wizards are no longer wizards.
What about cats?
Then there's nothing for it...
We'll just have to beat the crap out of you with our bare hands.
Then come.
Even in a physical fight, I'm trained to take on 50 people at once.
So you're fired up too, huh, Octo-man?
Be careful. He's a master of the fighting arts.
That's what I was hoping for.
Father?!
Don't...
I said... not to, but...
Time was etched, and then chaos descended.
Is this... the beginning of the end?
Oh, no... This miasma...
Nee-san! Look! The clock!
What... What's happening?!
What's that sound?! It's ringing in my head!
Help!
My head feels like it's splitting in half!
Please help!
Your Grace!
The pilgrims!
They're closing in at the foot of the slope!
We can't open the gate yet!
What should we do?!
At least protect His Grace!
I can hear it... the eternal midnight...
I can hear it...
The maggots...
They're swarming...
That damn thing's noisy!
Is it an alarm clock?
The crypt will be destroyed!
What is this?
Hey! Let's not just stand around! We gotta hurry!
What's this smell?
I know what it is...
They're here...
Huh? The clock's started to move...
And is that Oracion Seis?
That one guy isn't here! The one with the squarish face.
Oh, the one that goes, ...yes, right?
Y-Yeah, that's the one. But you didn't sound like him one bit.
Says you... yes.
Alright. Give it a rest.
Next time: The New Oracion Seis Appears!
I sound like him, yes.
I sound just like him, yes.
Yeah, you do! Totally like him!
Hey! Don't give up!
