Fairy Tail 146 Trans
After the new Oracion Seis appeared before Natsu and the others,
they were at their wit's end, as the Infinity Clock was stolen from them
and their mission to recover it ended in failure.
All of the Celestial Spirit Wizards' biological links were broken
and the Infinity Clock's true nature was revealed.
Then, time itself began to fall into chaos...
You say the person who broke out the imprisoned new Oracion Seis was Cardinal Rapowant?!
Yes, sir. I believe it's indisputable.
Please let me investigate.
No. The time isn't right yet.
Chairman, why not?
You don't understand how big Zentopia is.
Sir, that's...
Doranbolt, I'm sorry to say...
I heard.
I see...
Honestly, I'm disgusted with myself...
There's no point in leading the Enforcement and Detention Corps
if I can't take action during a crisis.
Don't give up.
As long as we do everything that we can...
Doranbolt...
His Grace!
Please tell us, Your Grace!
Why is Time's Chaos upon us?!
Why has the Infinity Clock appeared?!
Does this mean the destruction of civilization?!
Please tell us, Your Grace!
There is nothing to worry about.
This is Zentopia's way of putting the world in order.
And after this purge is complete, the world will be reborn
and we will begin to walk upon a new path.
Putting the world in order...
Using the new Oracion Seis to destroy churches,
disrupting Celestial Spirit Wizards' biological links,
and throwing time into chaos...
Is that really putting the world in order?
Without offering any answers, that girl Lucy is being sacrificed
and my duty to protect the Infinity Clock is...
Spiral of Time!
Men!
I, Ichiya, and this handpicked team of Fairy Tail members
will most definitely save Lucy-san and Natsu-kun!
That's a Man!
For the sake of my sister, too,
who pitted herself against Racer so we could charge ahead!
We're on our way, Lucy and Natsu!
I hope those two are okay...
I'm sure they're fine!
How can you be so certain?
I have faith!
Natsu promised it'd be okay!
Then what about Lucy?
If Natsu's okay, I'm positive Lucy's okay, too!
Yeah. I have the same feeling.
Mira is gonna be okay, too!
It's a Man to have faith like that!
The whole bunch wears rose-colored glasses...
Redesigned Christina, magic bomber of my guild,
Blue Pegasus, the pride of the continent...
We're nearing Zentopia Cathedral!
Men!
Where do you intend to go?
Where the archbishop is!
And what are you going to do?
Pay him back!
If the archbishop's the guy who used Michelle and did all this mean-spirited crap,
I'm gonna kick his ass!
His Grace?
Are you alright?
Lackeys, get fired up!
Right!
You guys are still around?!
True evil never goes on the lam empty-handed!
Right, right!
If the Infinity Clock isn't doable, we'll make do with another treasure!
Right, right!
Well, knock yourselves out.
We will, we will.
Lackeys, begin the treasure hunt!
Right!
It wouldn't even be worth using Rupture Magic on you people.
We'll be ba...
What the hell is he?!
The Cleaner... Gatman.
Gatman?
It seems you've got quite a lot of magic in you.
Be careful. He's an extremely dangerous opponent.
Is that so? Now I'm gettin' fired up.
Captain, deployments are complete!
Alright! Aim...
Fire!
Captain!
What about confirming my order?
Yes, sir...
Begin firing!
The army is in disorder, too, men...
This is also an effect of Real Nightmare?
Don't give me that!
This ain't... nothin'...
Is this any time for clowning around?!
Look who's talkin'!
And you call yourself a Man?!
W-What's happening?!
Wendy! You've become an adult!
And you've turned into a raccoon, Carla!
While you're now a dog, Happy...
This is no good. Everyone's fallen under the influence of Real Nightmare...
Wait. Then why am I fine?
I see! Could it be...
Requip!
I'll use this ancient weapon that's said to keep evil at bay
to cut through the Real Nightmare vibrations!
Meaning you hit us?!
We're back to normal!
I thought the archbishop's bedroom would be under heavy guard...
What's that?
What the hell is that?
Shhh! The archbishop is in here!
This is a pain in the ass. Let's quit with the hiding.
Huh? Wait!
You're the archbishop, right?
There is nothing to worry about...
This is Zentopia's way of putting the world in order.
There's somethin' I wanna ask you.
Would you give me an honest answer?
There is nothing to worry about...
This is Zentopia's way of putting the world in order.
Hey, are you listenin' to me?
There is nothing to worry about...
This isn't working.
This is Zentopia's way of putting the world in order.
What the hell's wrong with him?
Maybe someone is using magic to control the archbishop?
That guy...
Zentopia's Cardinal Rapowant!
I believe you're Gildarts from Fairy Tail, are you not?
Huh, I guess my reputation precedes me.
I never figured even a cardinal of Zentopia would know about me.
But if it's an autograph you want, I gotta decline.
I'm busy at the moment, see.
I give you two credit for making it this far.
But you won't get out of here alive.
Sounds like fun. Let's see what ya got.
I'm fast.
No one can... catch up with...
Stay away!
Get back!
Give it up already.
This battle is over.
Faster...
Be... faster!
What did you do?
Your speed increased even more?!
You certainly are fast...
How?
How... can you be faster... than me?
You're just running away.
I'm moving forward.
In a confrontation, the person who wants to help their friends
is stronger than the person who escapes.
What are you running away from?
Running away?
What was I... running away from?
Running away...
I was always... running away...
You were running away from yourself, weren't you?
From... myself?
That's right. From your own past.
Pain, failure, fear...
A painful past that made you want to escape...
I was the same way once.
I kept running from my bitter past.
That's why I understand... the pain in your heart.
No one's going to chase you anymore.
You don't have to run away.
Someone is calling me...
I have to look for that person.
Racer failed?
Cobra, Angel, stop them.
Zentopia's doctrine demands absolute loyalty.
Never doubt never doubt...
What happens if you doubt?
Traitors... will scatter!
What the hell?!
Magic that makes you explode... Rupture Magic!
I expand the magic that's in your body in the blink of an eye and make it explode!
Pull yourself together...
I don't care who it is that defies Zentopia's doctrine, I'll clean them up!
Make a fool outta me...
I like your spirit!
You can't!
You'll dance with him!
That's a nice rupture!
You'll keep dancing until there's no more magic left in your body!
I ain't got time to scrap with a clown like this...
Then you can have the last dance first, Natsu-chan.
I-I can't move!
I made it so you can't!
You!
What are you doing?!
I thought that anyone who opposed His Grace had to be a bad guy,
but between you and the new Oracion Seis,
I've lost the ability to tell who the bad guys are!
I don't know what to do...
Hughes...
I don't need to be able to move to use Rupture Magic.
Hughes!
It's not like... making someone freeze...
You two, get out of here!
But...
Coco, I want you to at least confirm with your own eyes what's right!
Now! Hurry up and go!
O-Okay!
Come on!
It's Fairy Tail!
Don't let them near the cathedral!
Fire! Fire!
Don't underestimate the redesigned Christina!
Men!
Wow!
Men.
They're here...
Fairy Tail...
They've shaken my faith in Zentopia, but I won't let them do as they please.
Go, Kanaloa!
An octopus is no match for my redesigned Christina!
Men!
They all bounced off, huh?
Th-This is...
Knock it off the ship!
Wha...?!
I'll leave the rest to you, Kanaloa.
I'm going to His Grace and ask him directly...
No...
At this rate, what happened seven years ago will occur again...
Fire spiral anchors!
Men!
The redesigned Christina and I will take care of this octopus by ourselves!
Before we do, though, everyone get out!
But Ichiya-san, you'll...
Never mind me! Just go!
Let's go, everyone!
Yeah!
Go... my friend...
Men!
Ichiya-san...
That bastard, actin' so cool...
He was a Man among men!
No matter how dangerous the circumstances, Ichiya always manages to survive.
We're going to rescue Natsu and Lucy!
Yeah!
There is nothing to worry about.
This is Zentopia's way of putting the world in order.
Gildarts!
Natsu...
So, you escaped your cell too, did you, Coco?
Your Holiness...
Natsu.
I know about you.
Natsu Dragneel... a Dragon Wizard...
I know this smell...
You smell the same as Master Zero.
Master Zero?!
I don't know if he's Master Zero or not...
What's wrong?!
Gildarts' voice reached me!
Apparently, Cardinal Rapowant is mind controlling the archbishop!
What?!
R-Rapowant is controlling His Grace...
Then he...
You! You'll pay for this, Rapowant!
Since you're the asshole controlling the archbishop,
you must be the same asshole who used Michelle to trick us, huh?
And if I am?
It's obvious! I'm gonna mop the floor with ya!
Hey, now... I'm the one who's gonna mop the floor with him.
Gildarts... Let me do it!
Two hotheads...
Laki!
If you love to fight that much, you two might as well fight each other.
What was that?!
If you don't do as I say, her life is forfeit.
Bastard...
Son of a bitch, this ain't funny.
You?!
How dare you fool me, Rapowant?!
Byro...
They're coming...
Your dear comrades are coming, Nee-san.
My comrades are...
You mean Fairy Tail?!
But they'll lose their lives.
What do you mean? Why will they lose their lives?!
It's your fault, Nee-san...
They adore you so much, they'll die.
That's...
I won't let anyone have you, Nee-san.
You're mine!
Michelle...
Become an adult, become a kid, what the hell's goin' on here?!
Time's become warped!
If we don't stop it fast, there'll be big trouble!
Big trouble... Specifically, what's gonna happen?
You're gonna delve into that?
If I don't know the reason, I can't get fired up!
Come on, Lucy's still captured and there are plenty other points
for you to get fired up about.
Next time: To the Infinity Castle!
Yeah, but still, it keeps sticking in my mind, it's like a pent-up feeling...
Never mind that! Hurry up and go save Lucy!
R-Right!
