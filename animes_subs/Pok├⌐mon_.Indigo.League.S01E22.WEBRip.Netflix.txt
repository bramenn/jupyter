After forfeiting to Sabrina's psychic Pokemon in Saffron City,
our friends learn from a mysterious bearded man how they might defeat her.
Now they're on their way to try and capture one of the ghost Pokemon
that haunts the dreaded Pokemon Tower in Lavender Town.
The fog's coming in.
And that's not good. We'd better be super careful.
We've got to make sure we don't get separated.
Maybe this is an omen.
Maybe we should forget about catching a ghost Pokemon.
We've come too far.
Everybody, let's hold hands and stay together.
- Okay. - Right.
Hey, Ash, where are you?
-Up here. -What do you mean here?
Right here.
Ah, there.
Pi... Pikachu!
Huh?
Brock? Oh, don't you know how scared it makes me when you yell like that?
- Well, Misty, you sure scared me. -Huh?
Ah! Say what?
I'm feeling like a ghost myself.
Sorry, guys. I was just testing you.
If we're going to try to catch a ghost Pokemon,
we got to learn to deal with fear.
That's the only way we're going to become great Pokemon trainers.
You must be crazy!
Don't ever do that!
Chu!
Argh!
We've got enough things to scare us without your boneheaded jokes.
Pika, pika.
I'll just save the masks till next year's Halloween.
The Tower of Terror
There's Lavender Town.
I'm glad we got here before it got dark.
Looks like it's always dark around this place.
This is the Pokemon Tower where ghost Pokemon hang out.
I like what they've done with the place.
Okay, Ash. It's time for you to show us what a great trainer you are.
Huh?
We'll let you handle this one alone.
Hey, wait a minute.
You guys promised me you'd help me capture a ghost Pokemon
when we got to Lavender Town.
I don't remember promising that.
You know how to deal with fear, Ash.
Ha, run away if you want to.
I'm not scared,
and I'm not going to let some stupid ghost Pokemon
prevent me from becoming a great Pokemon master.
Right, Pikachu?
Pikachu.
Pikachu.
All right, good idea.
Let's do this in the morning. Hey!
Make sure you don't wake me up too early, okay?
Night, guys.
Time to wake up!
-Chu! -Wah! Wah! Wah!
Maybe I'll be a little braver tomorrow morning.
There they are.
I'm so glad they could make it.
I'm no psychic, but I see success in our future.
This time, Pikachu's in the bag.
-Let's get started. -Mm.
-Whoa! -Hey!
James? Are you all right?
The floor broke his fall.
These old places can be so dangerous.
Huh?
What's that there?
Meowth, where are your manners?
It's impolite to leave your mouth hanging open like that.
Look behind you.
Look behind you.
-What are you jabbering? -Behind you. Look there!
Right there.
Behind me.
There's nothing there.
Wha...? Huh?
You must be seeing things.
It was there.
Huh?
Don't tell me you're seeing things again.
Get away!
It slipped.
You mangy alley cat. You numbskull.
You've ruined my beautiful face!
Ah!
Ah!
It was only a scratch.
A tragedy.
My face.
Perfection has been ruined.
You're right. This place is dangerous.
Thanks for breaking my fall.
Huh?
Horrible. It sounds really horrible in there.
You're right.
They must have some kind of torture chamber in there.
Torture chamber?
Ah!
This has got to be a nightmare.
Huh?
Gastly.
Oh, those screams again.
But I heard a different voice that time.
Those voices are familiar.
I feel like I've heard them all before.
Why don't we go inside and find out who they are?
You go in first.
Go. Go.
Hello, there.
Anybody home?
Uh, it's kind of dark in here.
Oh, now it's pitch-black. Do something.
Charmander, I choose you.
Char, char.
Char!
This place is creepy.
Maybe we should come back tomorrow when it's daylight.
Have you ever heard of a ghost that comes out during the day?
Look, I found a candle.
All right, Charmander, light up that candle for us.
Char!
Light the candle, not me!
Pika, pika, pi.
Watch where you walk. There's a hole in the floor.
Where are those voices coming from?
Gengar, Gengar, Gengar.
Gengar, Gengar, Gengar.
Ah!
Gengar, Gengar, Gengar.
Ga-ga... Gastly!
Gastly.
Gengar.
Gengar.
Gastly.
Might as well check in this room first.
Maybe we should just get out of here.
Nah, there's no way we can turn back now.
We've got to go in.
Uh, hey, ghost Pokemon, if you're in here, say hello.
I'm going to capture you.
Don't say that. If they know you're trying to capture them,
they won't come out of hiding.
You're right.
-Char, char. -Pika...
-What's this? -It looks like...
Huh?
It looks like some kind of fancy restaurant.
Maybe it's a party or some kind of reception.
But who's it for?
What's that string?
There's something written on the card.
It says pull this.
Well, why not?
Wait!
By who?
Look!
Huh?
Whoa! Help me!
-Ah! -Hold on!
Ah!
Come on!
Jump!
-Pika. -Char.
-Pika, pika, pika. -Char!
Gastly.
There is no way I'm going back in that tower.
It's just too scary in there.
Me neither.
What are you saying?
There's no way we can capture a ghost Pokemon if we don't go back in there.
Right, Pikachu? Charmander?
Pi... Pi...
Char!
Hold on! Are you two really cowards?
How do you expect to beat Sabrina's psychic Pokemon
if you don't go back in?
-Do you want to lose again? -Pi...
Cha! Cha!
Cha.
Listen, if you're ever going to beat psychic Pokemon,
you got to learn to overcome your fear, understand?
-Pi... -Mander.
I say it's time to give it another try. Pikachu, Charmander, are you with me?
-Pi. -Char.
Great. Let's do it!
Come on, guys. What about you?
-We'll both be waiting for you right here. -Have a nice time.
Wah!
Hello, everybody. We're back.
We'd love to meet you.
Feel free to introduce yourselves whenever you like.
Huh?
What was that?
Ghost Pokemon are in a vapor form.
Their true nature is shrouded in mystery.
Oh, well. Guess I'll try to solve the mystery.
- Cut it out. - Could you please knock that off?
- What's this? - Stop it.
They're down there. Time for us to go get them.
Pikachu, electric attack.
Pika.
Pikachu!
Charmander, flamethrower, now.
Char!
Hey, it's working.
Go, Poke Ball!
Huh?
Ouch.
Huh, I wonder if I captured it.
Oh, it's that stuck-up little brat again.
I'll get him if it's the last thing I ever do.
Someday, I'm going to make him pay dearly for what's he's done.
She's got fire in her eyes.
Yeah, and in her hair too.
Huh?
Hey, a fireball.
He's going to pay for this.
Aw, the fireball's gone.
Guess we'll get it next time.
Pi. Pika, pi!
Huh? What's what?
You must be seeing things.
Huh?
Uh...
Argh!
Is this a ghost Pokemon?
[Ash grunts
Haunter, a gaseous Pokemon.
No further information.
Huh? Is that all?
Well, we're not going to lose to some stupid ghost Pokemon.
Go, Charmander.
Huh?
Don't bother me now, Pikachu. Quit it.
Cut it out.
Uh...
I'm not afraid of you.
You just surprised me a little bit.
-Charmander, you're on. -Char!
Charmander, time to use your leer attack.
Bah!
Huh?
What are you doing, Charmander? You're not supposed to make it laugh.
Mander?
Oh, this isn't working.
Charmander, return.
Bah!
Do you really think I'm afraid of you?
Gengar...
Pika-pi!
Gengar. Gengar.
There are more of these?
Gengar!
I better find out about this one.
Gengar. No information available.
Not again.
Pikachu.
I don't get it. They're weird.
Huh?
Are you guys trying to be funny?
Your routine really isn't working for me.
Pikachu?
I'm sorry to say it, but their humor really leaves me cold.
Pikachu.
They're pretty sad.
- Pika-pi! - Hey! Don't go!
Wait a second!
Ah!
Huh?
Gen... gar?
Gengar.
-Huh? -Pi.
We're down there!
Pika, pika?
-What's going on? -Pikachu?
Haunter, Haunter.
-You're saying we're alike now? -Pika?
Oh, no! We've been totally separated from our bodies!
Haunter, Haunter.
No way. I don't want to be a ghost yet.
Ah, no! Wherever you're taking us, we don't want to go.
Ah!
Ah! Oh, what a view.
-Ah! -Pikachu.
Huh? Now's our chance to have some fun.
Pika.
Ash is taking too long.
I think we'd better go in and see how he's doing.
That's a good idea.
So, Misty, you're really worried about me.
Huh?
What's wrong, Misty?
I just thought I heard a voice.
-Come for a ride with me, Misty. -
- Ah! Misty! -Help!
The ghost has got me!
Okay, ride's over. Catch her, Brock!
Wait a minute. That voice...
I think something terrible's happened to Ash.
Yeah!
I'm flying!
Ah, cool.
Ah!
Ah!
You fooled me.
Pikachu.
Whoa.
Wow, look at all these toys.
Pikachu!
Haunt, haunt, haunt.
Gengar, Gengar, Gengar.
Gastly, Gastly.
Huh?
Do you mean you only wanted somebody to play with?
-Gengar, Gengar. -Haunt, haunt, haunt, haunt.
Really? Was that all?
You just wanted to have some fun, not scare people?
- Chu. -Huh?
-Gastly, Gastly. -Pikachu. Pika, pika.
I understand how you must have been bored for such a long time.
That's tough.
I'm sorry, but I can't stay with you and play with all these great toys.
There are still lots and lots of opponents out there for me to battle.
I have to fulfill my dream of becoming a Pokemon master.
Hmm.
Sorry, but I really have to go.
I'll miss you all.
Uh...
Ash? Pikachu?
Come on, wake up.
-Oh, Ash, can't you hear me? -Please say something.
Ash, open your eyes. Please, Ash.
Huh, I guess it's time to go back, Pikachu.
Whoa.
Hi, Misty.
Huh?
You're alive.
Pika.
Pikachu.
Hey, guys. Sorry to worry you.
No sweat. Glad to have you back.
But, Ash, what about the ghost Pokemon?
Ah, it's impossible to catch them.
What? Then how are you ever going to beat the psychic Pokemon?
Hmm, maybe I'll have to use my sense of humor.
Huh?
Pika!
Huh?
Huh?
Blah!
Pika. Pi, pika, pi.
Pikachu!
Well, it seems it was so much fun playing with Ash
that Haunter decided to follow along on his Pokemon journey.
Maybe together, their comedy act will knock out Sabrina's psychic Pokemon.
I can't take any more!
Let me off! I'm dizzy!
Stop the ride! I want to get off!
Looks like Team Rocket's throwing up again!
Pokemon! Its that time again!
A hundred and fifty Pokemon, five days a week.
Thats about 30 or so each day.
