Hey, Kanna-san, Kanna-san.
Want to come play at my place next time?
Your place?
Is it fun?
It's fun!
I have lots of games and snacks.
Plus we have our own maid, too!
Maid?
You could bring your maid with you, as well.
You know, the one who joined us for dodgeball.
When I talked about that, our maid said she'd love to meet her.
She wants to have a chance to discuss being a maid.
So it's okay, right, Kanna-san?
All right.
This is the place?
The reckless person who dares challenge me as a maid lives here?
I'll crush her!
Why am I here, too?
Because you know a lot about maids.
And your maid, and... Uh...
This is Kobayashi. She's my guardian.
Oh, hello, Kanna-san's mother.
Moth?!
Do I look that old?
Don't worry, Miss Kobayashi!
Compared to me, all humans are practically babies.
Young lady, I believe introductions are due.
Oh, right.
Let me introduce you.
This is our family's maid.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I am Georgie, and I serve this family as their maid.
Georgie
You don't seem to be dressed like much of a maid.
There's no black and white, for a start.
No, there actually isn't a set uniform for maids in the first place.
As their role as servants grew larger over a long period of history,
their outfits evolved into what we know today.
Yes.
This maid outfit is as one created with a young girl's
wages after entering the service.
I'm humbled by your discerning eye.
In other words...
You and I are...
Comrades!
Huh?! Miss Kobayashi, please don't be swayed by this strange maid!
You must be Tohru-san.
I've heard the rumors about you in the shopping district.
I've wanted to discuss maids with you for a while.
That's great!
This way please!
Huh?!
Oh, but this is the first time Miss Kobayashi's pulled me along so purposefully.
Well, Kanna-san, do you want to play in my room?
Wh-What should we play?
What's that?
Oh, this is twister. For kids.
I want to try.
Sure, let's give it a go.
Player one, left hand, yellow.
So you follow the directions and place your hands and feet on the proper colors.
Player two, right hand, blue.
Your turn, Kanna-san.
Mm.
Player one, left foot, red.
Oh, o-okay, red.
Player two, right hand, blue.
Blue.
Right foot, red.
Red.
Left foot, green
Green.
Ah, K-Kanna-san's so...
soft!
I want to play a video game.
I-I have plenty of video games.
A fun one.
A fun one, huh?
What a nice smell.
Is it first flush?
Impressive.
I did manage to acquire some first flush Darjeeling.
Oh! I know about that! It's a good, fresh tea, right?
I know that much!
Oh, this is an antique cup!
Is it from the Victorian era?
Yes, I picked it up from a flea market.
Georgie-san, what led you to like maids?
At first it was a picture book.
It was a story of a young lady becoming a maid...
I read that, too!
You, too, Kobayashi-san?
They were professionals entrusted with the house!
Their pride and dignified figures moved my heart!
Changing clothes between morning and afternoon...
Always paying attention to their appearance even when busy with work!
Their beautiful deportment!
How about this game?
Riko
Mm.
Okay.
Here.
Sit there.
Huh? Oh, sure.
Here, right?
Okay.
Wait, huh?
This spot's most comfortable.
I-I-I'm so happy!
Saikawa, that's too tight.
Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it...
Hey, Saikawa.
Yes?
Do you think I'm getting along with the kids in our class?
Well, of course you are.
You can do everything, and everyone praises you.
It feels different to me though.
I can't explain it well,
but I want something like what Kobayashi and Tohru share.
Kanna-san...
I like you a lot, Kanna-san.
I want to be even closer to you.
Frankly, I'd love to marry you.
Then...
Let's be even closer, okay?
U-Uh, um, I need to prepare my heart.
Saikawa...
I can't take it!
Don't run!
Join us in discussing maids!
Save me, Kanna!
Mm.
Huh?
So Georgie-san is Saikawa-san's older sister, huh?
I guess she goes by the nickname Georgie when disguising herself as a maid.
So she wasn't a maid, but a maid fanatic.
Back then...
What was Kanna-san about to do to me?
I wanted to...
Hmm, it's raining a lot.
Understood!
Wait, wait, wait!
You decided to move from your world to ours?
Yeah.
Why would you do that?
Lately I've been hanging out with you more often,
and being here's a little more convenient, y'know?
Plus it's closer.
Huh? To what?
I'm living at someone else's house, just like Tohru.
Do you mind if I keep stopping by?
I don't mind, but are you sure?
Yeah. I want to clear up the misunderstanding, too.
Misunderstanding?
Actually, that's partly why I decided to live in this world...
It happened one day while I was on my way home from here.
Huh?
Is someone performing a ritual nearby?
Hmm? A child?
Guess I'll go see.
You let yourself be summoned by a ritual some kid did because they were curious?
And you agreed to be their servant?
Well, what's wrong with that?
It seems they're from a family line of mages.
They accepted me pretty easily.
So the misunderstanding you want to clear up is...?
They think I'm a demon.
Do you think you could talk some sense into them?
Ah, we're here.
This is Shouta's house.
Come on, come in.
Huh? It's okay?
No one's around at this hour.
I'm using one of the rooms upstairs, so we can relax in there.
Tea's all I can offer you though.
Okay.
What?
First, there's something I'd like to ask.
Hmm?
What are you, Lucoa-san?
What do you mean?
Well, I thought you were a dragon like Tohru, but...
Oh right, I didn't tell you.
I guess I'm what you'd classify as an ex-goddess.
Ex?
Her colleague served her cursed liquor, and then while she was drunk
Oh, you mentioned that before.
Because of that, she was driven from her seat as goddess.
Then you might as well be a demon.
Well, I'm still responsible for spreading civilization far and wide,
so it's hard to call myself a demon.
Ex-Goddess
Which is why I prefer ex-goddess, feathered serpent, or Venusian.
Feathered Serpent
Venusian
How do you get Venusian?
Oh, someone's home.
Shouta, the one who summoned me.
He seems really fidgety.
Magatsuchi Shouta
He's always like that when I'm home.
Well, when he's with an older woman whose body is an agitator of lust...
That's why I've tried sleeping with him and bathing with him to make him less nervous,
but none of it has worked.
She invited people here!
A-A familiar can't be acting on their own!
Y-You demon!
Are you planning to gather your allies and take over our home?!
Looks like he wants to appear strong.
So cute, isn't he?
Ba-dump
Sorry, Shouta.
A-As long as you understand!
I called these two here today to help you properly understand me.
What do you mean?
I'm not actually a demon. I'm a dragon.
Huh? But I used a demon summoning circle...
I thought it might be dangerous
if a fiendish demon appeared in that summoning circle,
so I answered the call first.
N-No way...
But it can't be possible for me to summon a dragon with my magic power.
Y-You're just bluffing to make yourself seem more powerful, aren't you?!
You won't fool me, demon!
You see? It's like this every time.
I see.
Shouta.
Yes?
Apparently you're from a family of mages, but why did you perform that summoning ritual?
W-Well... Because I wanted to be accepted as a full-fledged mage.
In this world mages are living quiet lives, but one day we'll return to our original world.
My father's maintained our power
for the sake of that day, and worked hard to pass it down to me.
So I want to hurry up and...
Hmm, so you summoned Lucoa-san in order to prove your own power?
I kind of feel bad for Lucoa-san then.
Now that you mention it...
Even if she were a demon,
it would cause trouble for her to be summoned when she wasn't needed.
Even after summoning her,
you can't take her with you to elementary school,
so there's no point in her staying in this home.
Everything you say is right.
Hey...
Well, Lucoa, I'm sorry.
Isn't this implying I should leave?
No, I don't want to go home!
You don't?
But you can't just stay here doing nothing, right?
Even I'm working as a splendid maid to help Miss Kobayashi.
Huh? You are?
That's mean!
My mother handles all the housework.
In other words, you're saying I need to do something for Shouta in order to stay here?
How about more gold than you can ever use?
Don't need it, because Father can use alchemy.
I could teach you agricultural technology?
I don't want to be a farmer.
How about strong charisma?
That would just cause more problems if I had it now.
Then how about vast magical power?
Hmm, that's kind of appealing.
Then it's settled.
But I don't need it.
Huh? Why not?
I don't think there's much point if you don't work hard to earn that for yourself.
Huh?!
Useless
Shouta-kun's level-headed.
Miss Lucoa, I don't think you'll be much help to him.
Then this is all I have left...
My body.
You really are a demonic succubus!
Huh? Huh?!
You tied your own noose.
Man, it's novel seeing Lucoa-san getting flustered.
At this rate she'll be treated as a succubus for a while.
By the way, Tohru.
Yes, yes?
I've noticed something really bad about that house.
Huh? What is it?
From what I could see, it was just an ordinary home.
Well, Shouta-kun's father...
I found out from the pictures of him, but...
I think he's my company's director.
Wow, small world!
Shouta!
Stay out!
Come on, I'm not a demon. Look closer!
Go away, demon!
You need to look!
Don't come near me!
It's still pouring outside.
Well, it is the rainy season.
Let's hang this.
What is that?
A teruterubouzu.
A teruterubouzu?
Will something like that really make it clear up?
Well, eventually.
Episode 6
Home Visit! (And Homes Not Visited)
Well, Kobayashi-san, see you later.
Thanks for today.
Guess I should head home, too.
I'm hungry anyway.
Looks like you didn't work overtime today.
I'm happy you came home early!
I come home when I can.
Takiya-kun went home at the regular time, too.
Takiya...
I wonder if Takiya-kun and Fafnir-san are getting along well.
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him lately.
I saw him today.
Huh? Where?
On the way home from school, in the park.
He was jumping in circles over and over,
mumbling something.
That cursed dragon, what on earth is he doing?
What is he up to?
Kings!
Rule.
Citizens!
Suck.
Nyami-nyami.
Rules.
Kaboom!
Nice!
You're doing great!
You've improved a whole lot, Faf-kun!
Who's Faf-kun?
Oh, you don't like it?
My apologies then.
So, now you're all set for the call and respond part of tomorrow's event!
And I can obtain a limited edition item at that event, right?
That's right.
Today we're having curry.
Mild?
That's right.
Thanks for the meal.
Now...
I won't lose today.
Damn traps!
What did you just hide?
You idiot, you can't go that way!
Got the weapon!
Urk, I fainted.
Victory's mine.
I know.
I won't lose next time.
Bring it on.
Fafnir-dono, there's a game I'd like you to try playing for a bit.
The game you're selling at Comiket again?
That's right.
I'm at about the 80 mark.
Where's that?
About here.
Can't you add anything to this part?
Ah, that part does need something, doesn't it?
Fafnir-dono, how many hours a day are you logged in?
Roughly 21.
What level are you at right now?
280.
I've cleared all the limited time events, so I'm free now.
You're on the fast-track to gaming addiction, huh?
Hades 7: Huh? Ooyama-san, you're on again?
Hades 7: Huh? Ooyama-san, you're on again?
Hades 7: Huh? Ooyama-san, you're on again? Ooyama Takeshi: Don't talk to me, I'll kill you.
Hades 7: Huh? Ooyama-san, you're on again? Ooyama Takeshi: Don't talk to me, I'll kill you. Ebony Holy Knight: PK's impossible lolz
Hades 7: Huh? Ooyama-san, you're on again? Ooyama Takeshi: Don't talk to me, I'll kill you. Ebony Holy Knight: PK's impossible lolz Crystalite: He's here almost all the time, isn't he?
Hades 7: Huh? Ooyama-san, you're on again? Ooyama Takeshi: Don't talk to me, I'll kill you. Ebony Holy Knight: PK's impossible lolz Crystalite: He's here almost all the time, isn't he? Crystalite: Hard to believe he's human!
Ooyama Takeshi: I told you, I'm not human.
Ooyama Takeshi: I told you, I'm not human. Ooyama Takeshi: Don't group me with the rest of you.
Ooyama Takeshi: I told you, I'm not human. Ooyama Takeshi: Don't group me with the rest of you. Nayuta-san: As expected, Ooyama-san!
Ooyama Takeshi: I told you, I'm not human. Ooyama Takeshi: Don't group me with the rest of you. Nayuta-san: As expected, Ooyama-san! ChronosT: His roleplaying's crazy.
Oh, right, Fafnir-dono.
What?
Today I bought some hair conditioner on my way home from work.
And that will help with my hair?
Yes.
Another all-nighter today?
Well, I'm out.
Good night, Fafnir-dono.
Fafnir-dono, good morning.
This morning we have natto and rice.
Mild?
This doesn't work that way.
Rain, rain, rain...
Kanna's really happy about her new umbrella, huh?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Don't you know, Miss Kobayashi?
It's called sharing a lover's umbrella.
No, I know that.
But you have your own umbrella, don't you?
I prefer this.
Oh.
Looks like they're getting along well.
I shouldn't say this after recommending them for each other, but Mr. Takiya's incredible.
Being able to live with Mr. Fafnir.
Humans are either hits or misses.
The misses make themselves known quickly, but it takes time to know if you've found a hit.
And spending that much time on every person is bothersome.
As far as I'm concerned,
the misses that trespass on my home to steal my treasure are better.
Sorry for the wait.
However...
I can't wait for the event, Faf-kuah!
I don't mind.
Huh?
You're a hit.
Faf...
Let's hurry.
Oh, yes!
The teruterubouzu aren't working at all.
Yeah, it's still raining.
I love the rain.
True.
Rain's not so bad.
Next Episode
Lucoa, you're forbidden from approaching me naked from now on!
That's an order!
But my clothes are my scales, so I'm always naked.
Water Dragon Shrine
G-Get away from me you pervert!
