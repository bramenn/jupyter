Miss Kobayashi, Miss Kobayashi!
I'm the ultimate maid, aren't I?
Tohru
Maid
Of course you're not, but what's up?
Miss Kobayashi
No, I think I am the ultimate maid.
I told you, you're not.
I found this book.
Maid Cafe Open!
Welcoming you with the best maids
Maid cafe opening?
Welcoming you with the best maids
That's rather close.
The best maids?!
How can they make such false claims without me!
Yeah, no one should make false claims.
The dragon in front of me is doing that right now, though.
Actually a Dragon
For now, I'll turn them into ash from which nothing will grow with my cursed flames.
Literally burning love?!
No, you better not do that.
Regardless!
I'm going to scout out the enemy!
Is she okay?
I'm back home.
How was it?
You didn't do anything, did you?
Somehow, I wound up working there!
How?!
Because I'm
I proudly stormed the enemy's evil den.
Evil den?
Pardon me!
Oh, my. Are you here to interview for a job?
You're awfully motivated, wearing a maid outfit already.
You're so pretty, too.
You've conquered me with your zeal.
You're hired!
Yay!
So, I returned victorious!
Is that maid cafe going to be okay?
Well, I have had a lot of free time on my hands lately while you and Kanna are gone.
You're like a wife getting a part-time job because she's bored!
So, you are going to try working, then?
Will you be okay?
What are you talking about?
I work as a maid every day.
I'm used to it!
No.
Tohru, I may work at a company now,
but when I lived with my parents I worked at a restaurant.
So, listen.
You shouldn't underestimate the service industry.
M-Miss Kobayashi?!
The cosplay maids at maid cafes go against my personal principles,
but their spirit of service is worthy of respect.
This is a good opportunity, Tohru.
You should go learn about the service industry.
You're making me kind of scared now.
Several Days Later...
Well,
it's been some time since then,
so I wonder if Tohru is doing a good job at work.
Kanna Kamui (Actually a Dragon)
Kobayashi, you're a worrywart.
Is this it?
Oh!
And young lady.
Oh!
There're so many people like Lady Tohru!
Looks like this maid cafe went with plain style maids.
People don't use the word moe very much anymore,
but they've kept the spirit of those times.
Now, the menu...
Yeah!
This is also true to those roots.
There's a special service with every menu item.
I'm betting the magic chants like Turn delicious, moemoe kyun
are different for each one.
You know a lot, Kobayashi.
Just between you and me,
long ago I tried to work in a cafe like this.
It didn't work.
It didn't work out.
I don't get it, but poor you.
More importantly, where's Tohru?
Back there.
Table 10, order's up!
On it!
I'm running low on plates, so lay them out, lay them out!
Right away!
That's incredible skill!
Way to go, Head Chef!
You're really a huge help, Head Chef!
Head Chef Tohru-sama!
No, no, it's thanks to you all working efficiently...
Miss Kobayashi!
You came to see me?!
You're doing a splendid job.
I'm surprised.
You see that?
It's easy for me to handle!
I've taken another step forward as a maid...
As a maid...
I'm not working as a maid at all!
Yeah, you're the chef.
Hold on, I'll go ask someone on the floor to swap with me!
No, I think they put you in the right position.
No, it's the right position for a volcanic dragon!
Please go out and come back in again!
Eh?
Turn delicious.
It's good.
Tch, it's supposed to be Master!
When Head Chef first started on the floor she said,
I refuse to call anyone but Miss Kobayashi'Master'!
Wait, she doesn't even call me Master, though.
Please have a seat over here!
Now I can finally order.
Omelet rice! Omelet rice!
Okay, two omelet rices.
Yes, coming right up!
Now I'll cast a spell to make it delicious!
Be cute about it.
Of course!
I call upon the Shadow King that rules over this world,
make this the greatest it can be with these dark arts!
I beseech thee for abundance and quality worth praise!
Change its value and bring forth another monument to your glory!
Let my magic spread like mud and bring corruption,
let my principles erode the world and bring a deluge of madness!
Replace the genuine with falsehood!
Turn delicious, moemoe kyun!
Okay, now it's delicious.
Please eat up.
That was actual magic! A curse, in fact!
It's good.
Bring me the Head Chef!
Hello!
I'm the Head Chef, Maid, and Dragon, Tohru!
She has the skills, at least. Only the skills.
Though, I really don't want to be anyone but Miss Kobayashi's maid, so I'm quitting.
You can't!
Huh?
You can't do that!
Our cafe's already famous for the taste of your food, Head Chef!
There are so many posts spreading about it through word of mouth on the net!
Head Chef!
Head Chef!
Head Chef!
Uhh, then...
I'll teach you the magic chant to make food delicious.
Listen closely.
For a human to do it, you'll have to draw this magic circle first...
Oh, this is a nice cafe.
Okay, we'll take two omelet rices.
Coming right up.
Now I'll cast a spell to make it delicious!
I call upon the Shadow King that rules over this world,
make this the greatest it can be with these dark arts!
Takiya Makoto
This is an awfully unique maid cafe!
I beseech you for abundance and quality!

The Head Chef's Cooking Was Really Delicious.
I underestimated it because it was a maid cafe. I thought the food came second as long as I could enjoy the girls.
However, their most popular dish, the omelet rice, tasted better than any other restaurant's omelet rice.
Too Delicious for a Maid Cafe! Practically
Omelet Rice Was Superb!
food was delicious!
omelet rice
As a maid, not a chef!
Where are the reviews about me as a maid?!
Don't break my mouse, okay?
Episode 1
New Dragon, Ilulu! (Please Be Nice to Her Again)
We predict sudden changes in the weather patterns,
Ahhn.
so please pay attention to future weather reports.
Early This Morning Unexplained Landslide
Landslide, No One Injured
Next up is the news.
Early this morning there was a large-scale landslide.
It looks like the earth was sliced away,
That's where I met you, Tohru.
and there are many unexplained aspects,
so the local government advises people to stay away from the scene.
How could they do that to our precious spot!
The city has already requested an investigation
I'll find the culprit and send them to Gehenna, then Jahannam,
and aid for restoration from the prefecture and national government.
and finally feed them to Amam!
An emergency meeting has been called between local, prefectural, and national officials
But the only ones who could do something like that are...
Fafnir (Actually a Dragon)
I was reviewing the calls and responses for a game event at that time.
Magatsuchi Shouta
Lucoa's been out of the country since yesterday.
We're bound by... by my magic power,
so I can tell where she is.
Elma (Actually a Dragon)
Taiyaki! It's so good!
What are you doing here out of the blue, Tohru?!
You're the culprit!
What are you talking about?!
On today's news there was a mountain that...
Oh, yeah. I was curious about that, too!
It wasn't you either?
I just assumed Tohru had done that.
No, I didn't!
Hold on.
Then, that means it was some dragon other than the ones we know?
There aren't that many who could break my barrier.
Then... who?
Me.
Ilulu
Good afternoon.
Ilulu.
What a pretty city.
People laughing.
With so many here, you could enjoy all the destruction you wanted.
Yet here you are, a chaos dragon laughing with humans.
I was watching because I was a little curious,
but now I'm sick of it. So forget it.
Long and short,
you're an enemy!
Tch!
Who is that?
Ilulu.
She's with the most radical wing of the chaos faction.
She just plain loves destruction.
I'm sure she followed Tohru here.
Also followed Tohru here
See, what did I just tell you?
She's planning to destroy this world.
Well, still...
Tohru will do something about her.
Miss Kobayashi, Ilulu's might is only slightly below Tohru's.
If the two of them fight, they'll destroy this whole region.
She'll do something about that, too.
You believe in Tohru?
Well,
that's really
all I can do.
So, I'll just do that.
Destruction isn't allowed in this world.
What are you saying?
I'm with the chaos faction.
If you can't abide by that, I'll blast you back to whence you came.
I'm more than happy to fight.
Attacks like that won't affect me.
Oh, no! The city!
Hot!
Ow!
Uhh, is she struggling?
Tohru is trying to protect the city while fighting.
She's at a disadvantage.
You're not going to help her?
Me?
I'm with the harmony faction.
Normally, Tohru and I would be enemies.
Huh?
I have put up a barrier to keep humans away,
but that's just to avoid trouble.
What about the other dragons?
Sir Fafnir would tell her to clean up her own mess.
Lady Lucoa is with the spectator faction, so she won't intervene.
Kanna wouldn't be strong enough.
If she defeats Tohru, then I'll fight, as well.
I'll try to protect both you and this city.
But then, Tohru would be...
Even if I believe in her,
if that doesn't give her strength, it's no different than doing nothing.
But that's all I can
Elma!
Miss Kobayashi, if you're asking me to aid Tohru, I can't.
Pudding!
Wait! You can't just buy me off with...
Cream puffs!
Coffee jelly!
Chocolate cake!
Maple syrup pancakes!
All the sweets you can eat!
Ow.
I hit you with thirty shots of flaming acid.
I landed several good blows with my claws, too.
And all that earns is an ow?
Well, I'm stumped.
I can't think of a way to kill you.
Me, neither.
If I attack you all-out, the city will be destroyed.
But I can't defeat you otherwise.
Your attacks are starting to get irritating, too!
But I have to protect the city!
I'm ready to explode
and take everything with me.
You're bluffing.
Tohru!
Elma's put up a barrier!
Only because Miss Kobayashi made a deal with me!
So, what?
That's disgusting, acting all friendly with humans.
We're just getting started!
Now to destroy this world with my true form!
That was a close call.
I didn't take that much damage,
but I nearly forgot I had to protect the city, too.
For a moment I almost thought I could just let everyone but Miss Kobayashi die.
But then I wouldn't be able to stay in this world.
Miss Kobayashi, umm...
Shall we go home?
Yes.
I can try as hard as I must.
If it means staying with Miss Kobayashi,
I can break any obstacles that stand in my way.
That human...
She got Elma to act and saved Tohru.
Humans are our enemies.
That's what we were taught, but...
I want to know...
about that human...
Quetzalcoatl (Actually a Dragon)
Huh? Me? Me who?
Oh, yeah.
A cold? Hmm.
The train?
Your bag? Yeah.
Compensation?
By today?
Two million?
Oh, that's terrible.
It was hard enough getting the gate open.
I'm surprised Tohru so easily pulls off something that draining.
The last train, huh?
I guess I could have Tohru come pick me up.
You.
The human called Kobayashi.
Why are you living with a dragon?
Because Tohru chose to fit my lifestyle, not because I did anything.
Aren't you afraid?
Fear me!
Well, not when she's that cute.
So...
She makes you horny?
Stop
Huh?
You're in love with Tohru's human form.
That's why you're fine?
Huh?
No, no, what are you talking about?
A strong denial.
Suspicious.
That's not it!
Then...
What is this? Wow...
Well?
You're only human in the end.
You can't resist your desires.
Now, let your pitiful male instincts run free!
You want to be loved, right?
Tonight you can unleash your lusts on me.
Go on.
Go on, go on.
I'm a woman!
Ow!
Cut the crap!
I'll unleash flames of rage and resentment on those huge lumps of fat every day!
Ahh, the last train's about to leave!
Tatsunokuchi Station
Ah, wait!
Please do not rush onto the train while doors are closing.
What?
Haven't caused enough commotion?
I can't accept you.
Humans and dragons can't coexist.
When they're together their differences cause suffering,
and as that suffering continues it breeds hatred for others.
Respect turns to envy
and eventually creates pain.
What Tohru feels for you is nothing more than curiosity.
When that finally runs out...
Don't sleep!
Oh, it's fine.
I was listening, I was listening.
Liar!
You were talking about the differences between species or something, right?
You said you can't accept me, right?
So, is there something you want a human like me to do to satisfy you?
Correct your understanding!
I'll borrow your own words to say my piece, then.
When we enjoy our differences
and that enjoyment continues, it breeds love for others.
Respect is joined by trust
and eventually creates bonds.
I would say that's what I feel in my life with Tohru.
That's just a convenient interpretation!
There are still tragedies, too!
You're just glossing over it with pretty words!
Yeah.
We do fight and hurt each other,
but I turn a blind eye to that
and I don't care if it gets buried under something ugly.
Even if I don't properly understand her feelings,
I've done what I can to respond to them,
and we manage.
That's the kind of person I am.
Is that how you humans think?
No. It's how I, Kobayashi, think.
Don't you distinguish between how you and other dragons think?
There's no need to.
They're the same.
Really?
But the dragon who came up with what dragons should think
wasn't you, was it?
You can spout your pretty words, but you're still a human.
It didn't work because you're a woman.
Oborozuka
Whoa.
I guess Ilulu left?
Huh?
What is this?
