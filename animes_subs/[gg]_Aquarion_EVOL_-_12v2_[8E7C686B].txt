Skies of Aquaria
Next Time
The Fallen Giant
osore
living your life don't give up now keep moving on
kimi wo dakishimeru nandomo nandomo nandomo
ashita boku wa kimi ni deau darou
wazukana hoshiakari wo tayori ni
boku ni wa kimi ga wakaru yo wakaru yo
sen'oku no toki wo koe futari hiraku densetsu no tobira
naraku no ao tobikoete
kimi to hai ni naru tame
nagaki rinne wo kanashimi tsurete tabi shitekitanda
zenryoku de mikansei kimi no tonari de
kawaita kokoro hodoke chi wo nagasu kedo
soba ni iru yo zutto yorisotte zutto
futari hikari no fune ni noru
kaze no hajimari no oto kanadeyou
Even if you're scared
Just live your life, don't give up now, keep moving on
And I'll come for you over and over and over again
We'll find each other soon enough
By the faintest glimmer of starlight
I know you, I know you
It's been billions of years, but now we can open the door to our legend
I crossed over the deep blue void
so I could burn to ash along with you
I've had a long journey on the vast wheel of fate, gathering sorrows along the way
I'm not perfect, but I'm giving all I have
If I open my fragile heart to you, I know I'll bleed...
But I'll always be with you, always be in your arms
We'll get on a shining ship of light
And call forth the wind with our voices
kaze ni ubawareta wake janai
We weren't spirited away on the wind
katamichi bun no yuuki de bokura
We knew we could never return, and found the courage
higeki wo ukeireru
to accept the hardship
kokoro ga koko ni atta hazu no kuudou
There's an emptiness where my heart used to be
motto boku ga ookikereba
If only I was stronger
kimi wo mirai wo sukueta darou ka
I could have saved you, and our future...
taisetsu na hito wo mamoru sube ga tatta hitotsu shika motanai
I only know of one way to keep the people I love
sonna anata ga haguretadayou sora
And you left me and disappeared into the sky
anata ijou no hito ni deaenai
I'll never find anyone like you again
tsuki ni aragau nagai furea
A long flare reaches out against the moon
hajimaru mo sezu owaru monogatari
The story ends before it could even begin
kizutsukiuru yawarakasa
So soft, so fragile
tojikometa senritsu kanaderu hodo
I will call up the melody locked away
utau hodo kowareru hodo ni
And sing it until I destroy myself
anata ga koishii
That's how much I love you
Hey there!
I have some nice pics.
Photos of Rare Iguras!
See any you like?
Oh, uh, yeah.
I'll take this one, this one, and this one.
Couldn't make up your mind?
What? No, these are for investigation!
Investigation?
Nothing!
How much do I owe you?
I don't want any money.
Instead...
Let me take a few shots.
You shouldn't...
Oh, I insist.
You're shockingly popular.
You're the mysterious transfer student!
Get him eating the hot dog!
That's a good idea!
Do it!
Here, eat!
Say ahh...
Quit it!
Jin's making really good progress.
Good for him.
Are you serious? You didn't get to tell her?
No...
All right, all right.
Your bro Andy is going to give you a boost, or should I say dig you a hole?
You don't have to dig a hole for everything.
It's way too serious at Neo-Deava anyway.
Something exciting, something to get everyone to have fun...
That's what we need around here!
How are you going to excite anyone by digging a hole?
Dude, I got this.
You know what's tomorrow, right?
Tomorrow is the anniversary of Holy Angel Academy's founding.
On that day 12 years ago,
the school was founded to gather young Elements,
and prepare them to defend Earth from its attackers.
I expect that each of you will live up to your predecessors
No way.
and redouble your work and studies for the future.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of our school's founding.
Let's forget about the daily grind and plan our own awesome event!
We'll have a planning meeting after school in the boys' dorm.
What is this?
Andy wouldn't let it go.
Hey, what's going on?
You can come too, Zessica.
What did you invite Zessica for?
What are you talking about?
Nothing!
Hey, Jin. Give me a hand.
Wait! Hold on a sec!
What?
You can't go to sleep now!
The girls are coming over and we're going to have a sweet pajama party!
Yes, a pajama party!
A form of excitement enjoyed 12,000 years ago!
Wasn't it a planning meeting?
Come on, help me out!
You're not great with girls, are you? This is a good opportunity!
Better learn now, before you have to Union with one!
Union?
Hell yeah, Union!
When our hearts join, and we caress with our souls!
And at that instant, pure bliss!
It really feels that good?
It's a feeling that can't be put into words.
But you'll understand when you do it yourself!
You know, you still haven't done it with a girl...
Union...
Since when was this hole here?
Are you okay?
I'm fine! I'm not scared at AAHH!
I'm really sorry for scaring you.
Yunoha?
Can I please come with you?
What troubles you, my friend?
Shrade.
Something must be, to find you so lost in thought.
Are you still concerned about that transfer student?
He appears to bear darkness in his heart.
Much like yourself.
Do I look like I'm bearing darkness?
Finally, we're through!
Mikono!
Here we are!
Don't be shy! Come in and make yourselves at...
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
He just ran into us...
Seriously?
We're crashing this party.
Excuse us.
We're not trying to do anything weird here!
We just want to plan something exciting for the anniversary...
Did you say exciting?
Wait! He didn't mean exciting like, love exciting!
We just want to have a really fun party, and...
Cut that out! Stop nosing around in our stuff!
But Mix said boys hide all their tainted stuff.
I've never been in a boy's room before, so I want to see if that's true.
Well, stop it!
Hi.
I found a tainted picture!
That's not
Silvie?
It's that actress!
She was the female lead in Skies of Aquaria.
I'm kind of a fan of hers.
But this doesn't look like a publicity photo.
Jin's a fan of hers too. Aren't you?
Really?
Why don't you show them?
You know, that device that plays Alisia's song.
Whoa!
Can we see?
Wow!
Sweet!
Where did you get that?
Hey, I know!
What?
The anniversary party event!
Let's show Skies of Aquaria!
I think that would be great!
Right?
Tonight, the Berlin itself will become a giant movie screen!
There'll be an emergency screening of Skies of Aquaria!
The movie will begin at 12 sharp in the courtyard under the Berlin!
It will be opened with a live performance by Shrade!
You're showing a movie on the Berlin?
I take it you have permission.
Of course I do! It's the big anniversary event!
Come and have some fun!
You can join the crowd and go wild,
watch it quietly by yourself,
or make it a special, romantic night for two!
Hey, wanna watch with me?
With you? Never!
Is this wise? We never know when the Abductors will attack.
But we must also relax from time to time.
Life is but a dream.
A dream recorded on film is yet a dream.
Come in, command!
This is Jin! What's going on? Is anyone there?
What's happening up there?
This is a top priority message.
I've identified a Rare Igura who could be the true Eve.
I'm going to bring her back in one of the Machine Angel's components.
Be ready to open the gate.
Jin?
Did you hear that?
Did you hear?
I didn't...
What's the matter, Yunoha? Come here and give me a hand.
Wait!
No!
She'll never forgive me...
And if you get pineapple on it, it's even better!
No way! I can't stand pineapple on pizza!
Zessica! Come check this out!
We're gonna get a pizza delivered!
Sounds great.
But I'm kind of busy.
If I hadn't been in that theater that day watching Skies of Aquaria,
we never would have met.
Yeah.
And we wouldn't have this life either.
I'm sorry.
What for?
For getting you into all this danger.
It's not your fault!
All of this is my choice.
Alisia said it in the movie.
Everyone has the wings to fly beyond their destiny.
My mom flew away beyond her destiny.
She abandoned me when I was little.
And my mom... is Alisia.
So that's why you have that picture.
She flew off beyond her destiny,
went away, and left me behind here.
All I could do was watch her.
Mom never wanted me.
You're wrong!
I was like you! Cayenne did everything, and...
and I was useless.
The Suzushiro family is supposed to have great Element powers.
But I didn't have any, and he left me behind.
When he got into Neo-Deava...
But just because we're useless doesn't mean no one wants us!
Everyone is wanted by someone.
Everyone has someone somewhere who wants them.
Who's waiting for them.
You made me realize that, Amata.
Thank you.
Will you watch the movie with me?
I'll find a special spot where no one will bother us.
A special spot? How?
With... with my wings for flying beyond destiny.
That's no way to watch a movie.
Let's just keep our feet on the ground, okay?
Don't grab me there!
Now's not the time for that!
Mikono!
I have to tell her I'm sorry.
Otherwise she'll have her guard up and I'll never be able to take her back.
I think it turned out very interesting.
How do you intend to take responsibility for this?
Responsibility?
Are you saying I understand such a concept?
You...
But forget that for now.
Something fascinating is happening to Jin.
He has begun his journey into the realm of love.
What?
Love is the root of sin.
About before, I just...
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
I was shocked at the time, but it's fine now.
Everyone has secrets they really have to keep.
That's...
But you have to believe me!
I really didn't hear anything!
Jin?
It's nothing!
You fixed Tama for me!
Tama?
That's her name.
Oh.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
I know!
Let's watch Skies of Aquaria to show we're friends again!
I've never even seen it before.
I'm really looking forward to it.
Okay.
It's a promise!
Bye!
Wait!
I'll be waiting right here tonight!
Is this...
Could it be...
Union?
I thought I left it right here.
Oh well.
It's pretty...
Jin?
Are you there?
Jin, are you there?
Kagura is on his way.
The gate to Vega will open soon.
Bring your Rare Igura before he destroys everything.
Sorry I'm late.
What's the matter?
It's nothing.
Cheers!
Ladies and gentlemen, your feature presentation!
A masterpiece for the ages, Skies of Aquaria!
Sit back, relax, and enjoy!
A story of a meeting and a parting.
A story of a miracle.
A story of the promise we made 12,000 years ago beneath the tree of life.
A story of love.
Everyone has the wings to fly beyond their destiny.
Abductor alert! Abductor alert!
Seriously?
We're being attacked now?!
Kagura!
It's him!
Are you okay?
Where's my wench?
Yunoha Thrul.
Come with me.
When the boys feelings halta di mana,
the girl will learn cinca di mana for the first time.
But the two of them will ola ola o.
Next time on Aquarion Evol: The Fallen Giant.
