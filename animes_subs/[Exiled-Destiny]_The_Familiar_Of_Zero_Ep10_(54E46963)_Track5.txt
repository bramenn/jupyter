Princess?
What is the matter? You're here alone, and so late at night...
I have an urgent request to make of you two in secret.
A history of the couple's romance that starts from the first kiss
You, the one who cast magic on this destiny, suddenly appeared
The sky where two moons never fade away
That's an impossibility, right?
This is the first time I've felt anything like this
I'm feeling more and more at ease with this place
Even if you trip and become depressed
I will always hold you tight with a squeeze
The story where we met that day stays hot with a sweet kiss
See, you can cast magic, and the wishes will surely come true
A history of the couple's romance that starts from the first kiss
You, the one who cast magic on this destiny, suddenly appeared
A Princess's Request
I have decided to marry into a family in Germania.
What did you say?!
Of all things, the country of all those savage upstart nobles?!
It cannot be helped.
To protect our small country of Tristein,
we need a strong alliance with Germania.
A marriage of convenience to the country?
You stay quiet!
Even if it's for our country, to face such a hardship...
I am the princess of Tristein.
I do not mind sacrificing myself for the sake of the country.
However...
However, there is one thing that I must do before that.
Princess!
If there is anything that I can do, please tell me to do so!
Thank you, Louise FranCoise.
I would like you to retrieve a certain item.
A certain item?
A letter that I sent to Prince Wales in Albion.
Albion?
If the world finds out about that letter,
this engagement will be called off.
Princess...
What kind of letter is it, that would ruin a marriage...
I told you to keep quiet!
Albion is currently politically unstable,
and in a dangerous situation right now.
I hear the nobles started a coup d'etat,
and the royal family is about to fall from their reign.
I'm sorry,
for even asking such a close friend to do such a thing...
But now, you two are the only ones I can ask such a thing!
Thank you so much, Princess.
Louise FranCoise...
To request me to perform such an important mission...
I could not be happier.
Louise...
Then, will you go for me?
Who is it?!
Guiche!
I have heard everything.
Weren't you just eavesdropping?!
Please ask me, Guiche de Grammont, anything you wish...
Don't be so reckless!
Grammont?
Then, you must be General Grammont's...
I am his son.
You will be of service to me as well?
So Guiche is going to tag along after all?
He's just going to get in the way.
I think I just heard some noise...
Oh, well.
Um...
Oh, Siesta.
I'm terribly sorry.
That bit about the love potion really was true.
I was so rude to you, Mr. Saito.
You shouldn't worry about it.
Louise is back to normal too.
If it is Gundolf, it is worth believing.
Gundolf again, huh...
Hey, who at this school has a detailed knowledge of history?
History, is it?
Originally, there were five elements of magic,
not just Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.
The five elements are said to have been the pinnacles of the pentagon.
That lost apex is the element of Void.
Gundolf is the familiar of the legendary Void mage.
Void mage?
However, in modern times,
no mage has been confirmed to have Void magic.
The rune that appeared on your hand
closely resembles that of Gundolf.
But...
As long as no Void mage exists,
unfortunately, we cannot be certain that you really are Gundolf.
The master is far from legendary, the way she is.
I thought something smelled.
Is this it?
That is the blood of a dragon.
Dragon's blood?
In the past, two dragons never seen before
appeared in the skies with a tremendous roar.
One of them disappeared,
and the other fell somewhere, they say.
I happened to come across blood
that was said to have been shed at that time.
I am in the middle of replicating it.
This is blood?
I mean, this smell...
Prince Wales of Albion and our princess are cousins.
Cousins, and childhood friends?
Louise?
I'm not any good at magic.
Can I go through with such an important job?
What are you doing?
Nothing will get done if you worry.
We got through everything in the past somehow, right?
Must be nice to be so easy-going.
You know...
What?
If something happens, I'll protect you.
Of course, that's to be expected!
You're my familiar!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
This is the Ruby of Water, that my mother has entrusted me with.
Right now, this is the only reward that I can give you.
Princess...
I will send one of the guards with you.
Ask him to lead the way to Albion.
The guard...
It's about time he would show up, I'd think.
What?
Verdande!
Oh, my cute little Verdande!
You thought I would leave you behind again,
because I went to the lake without you the other day?
You touch my heart so!
Let me tell you, we can't take a big mole with us.
What is it?
No!
Wait!
Where do you think you're touching?!
Guiche!
I see, the ring.
The ring?
Verdande loves gems, especially ones that are valuable.
You've got to be kidding!
I won't stand for a mole eating the valuable ring the Princess gave me!
Enough of that! Help me out here!
Verdande!
Who is it?!
Up above!
A griffon...
Who are you?
I am Wardes, leader of the griffon squad,
ordered by Lady Henrietta to accompany you on this trip.
It's you!
Of the famous Magic Guards?
Louise...
Sorry to surprise you.
I had thought that my fiancee was in trouble.
Fiancee?
You're kidding!
You are as light as ever! Just like a feather.
It has been a while, Lord Wardes.
What's the commotion, so early in the morning?
Who's that good-looking guy?!
Louise... That wench!
The top of the elite, the leader of the griffon squad,
is going to guard us personally?
I can't feel anything but impressed by all of this!
Whatever.
I was very surprised.
I had not heard that you would be coming here, Lord Wardes.
We can't move the entire griffon squad on a secret mission.
When I was asked by the princess to do something about the letter,
I requested to guard you all personally.
You asked to personally?
Of course.
Hearing your name, there's no way that I could stay put.
Lord Wardes...
What's this Lord Wardes thing...
Something wrong?
Oh, nothing...
Hey, aren't we going to the port?
This is in the mountains, no matter how you look at it.
You really don't know anything.
Are you tired?
No, not at all...
This is a good chance to catch up on all the time we have spent apart.
Oh, yes...
Well, I won't be surprised at whatever comes my way.
Oh, it's in sight now.
That is the port village, La Rochelle.
All the buildings here are carved out of one boulder.
Thanks to Square-class mages specializing in Earth,
it's a work of art.
We will spend the night here, and depart tomorrow evening.
Understood?
Understood, Mister Wardes!
Saito, at least answer him. Don't you think it's rude?
It's all right, Louise.
I don't like to act like nobility.
There we go.
You know, I'll tell you this much.
What?
My parents decided on this fiancee thing.
Hmm.
What was that hmm for?
He's stuck-up,
but he seems to be the most decent of all the nobles I've met,
so he's a good guy, isn't he?
That's right! I've always looked up to him, from when I was a child!
He had lost his parents early on,
and went through many hardships to become leader of the Magic Guards!
Unlike you...
What?
Well, you know...
I guess I didn't have to tag along.
You're a familiar! It's a given that you're coming with me!
Oh man... I just don't know.
What, you were in love with Louise?
I'm not in love with her!
So savage, so selfish, such a twisted personality...
Then why are you so depressed?
I'll protect you!
I just wish I hadn't said something that cool.
That's all.
To summon a human familiar... Nothing less from you, Louise.
Even you would say that, Lord Wardes?
No, I'm not being sarcastic.
This is an amazing thing, Louise.
I heard that you two had a duel.
That was...
Is it true that the duel was the first time you wielded a sword, Saito?
Well, yeah.
Is it also true that you used the Staff of Destruction
to capture Fouquet the Sculptor as well?
I guess.
You really know the details.
Being where I am, I get all sorts of detailed information.
Even about a peasant familiar like him?
That's why I've grown an interest in you.
I had thought I would like to ask you for a practice match.
The ship leaves tomorrow night.
It's boring to just spend idle time, right?
Lord Wardes!
Of course, I won't force you to do so.
I don't mind.
Saito, stop it!
Lord Wardes, this is no time to be doing such a...
It's okay. I'll go easy on him, of course.
Now, let's get to our rooms soon.
Come, Louise.
Room?
No, I can't. We're not married yet.
It's all right. We're engaged.
But...
I have something important to tell you.
A romantic evening.
Not really.
It's pitiful that you're the one I'm sharing it with.
Same here.
Oh, that's right! I remember now, I have to do something!
Do something?
I just remembered that when we were eating,
there was a young lady!
I have to speak with her. Otherwise I'd be rude, yes?
What's with that logic?
Hey, Derf.
What is it, partner?
Do you know about Gundolf?
What are you talking about, this late in the game?
What are you, if you're not Gundolf?
My partner has always been Gundolf, 6000 years ago to the present.
Are you crying, mi lady?
Viscount, you were here?
You were scolded again by your father?
Now, come. I will speak well to your father.
It's all right. I am at your side.
Your magical powers were always compared with your older sisters,
and you always pouted in that small boat.
Geez, Lord Wardes!
But I always felt an aura from you unlike any other, even back then.
An aura unlike any other?
There is a special power that only you have.
That's not true.
I've had only failures in magic so far.
Let's get married when this mission is over, Louise.
We just happened to buy something
from the bargain rack in the armory, you know?
Even if it was coincidence...
There is no coincidence in this world.
You are my partner, and that's why I'm here.
Isn't that common sense?
Then why didn't you tell me until now?
Because you didn't ask.
Well, you have a point.
The power to freely wield weapons, huh?
I'll tell you this,
it only applies to things made to be weapons.
It doesn't work at all for things made to be ornaments,
like that shiny sword from the other day.
Then if I wielded you, would I win?
Even against that Wardes guy?
Are you stupid? That's all up to you. I'm only being used.
I don't intend to end as just the leader of the Magic Guards!
Someday, I would like to rule a country...
No, I want to be a noble that moves the entire world of Harkeginia!
But, such a sudden marriage?
I need you, Louise.
But it's so sudden!
Louise...
I will protect you.
If something happens, I'll protect you.
Saito...
No, that's not it.
Saito came here from another world, not knowing anything,
and I was the one that summoned him. I'm responsible...
It looks like someone is starting to live inside your heart.
It's not like that! That can't be true!
It's all right. I won't ask you to give me an answer right now.
Listen to me, Lord Wardes!
By the end of this journey, your heart shall be completely mine.
Let us rent one more room for now.
Lord Wardes...
Good night, Louise.
Good night.
Oh, wait!
Sheesh, I was only trying for a kiss.
These mountain girls are all so innocent.
Then shall we begin, Saito?
Sure.
Stop this foolishness! Sure.
Stop this foolishness!
Nobles are troublesome folk.
Am I strong or weak?
It gets on your mind and you can't help but to move.
Saito, this is an order! Stop it!
I can't hold anything back, okay?
No need to hold back. Come at full strength.
So agile... as I expected.
But you are still a novice, with many openings.
Del Wil Sol La Winde.
Look out, partner!
Are you all right, Saito?
You can't win against a real mage with your skills.
In other words, you can't protect Louise.
As if I were under a real magic spell
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart
But each time I see you, I give you a pointy, cold shoulder
Why do I act mean towards the one that I think about the most?
My true feelings, the shards of loneliness
In the deepest part of my heart, I'm calling for you
For the day to start from zero
Marriage? It's too sudden for such a thing.
It's true that, Wardes, my feelings for you...
But, but, what should I... Saito...
