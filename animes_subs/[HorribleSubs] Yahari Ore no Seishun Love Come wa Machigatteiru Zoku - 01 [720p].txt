I want to send them to you today
The suddenly serious look I see in your profile
Makes my heart race faster and faster
You know? We go! Miracle
Jesus, Jesus! Please hurry
Every time I look at you, my heart is pounding
I want to be closer to you
Please notice before this sweet premonition melts
I want to be special to you
Why is that the only way you can handle things?
See? It's easy.
I just created a world where nobody gets hurt.
My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU TOO!
After the cultural and athletic festivals ended with no major problems,
the temperature dropped,
and a wind better described as cold than cool blew through.
For that matter, it's even more bitterly cold around me.
Nothing new there.
Hey!
No fair leaving me out! What Hikitani-kun is that?
Whattytani-kun?
Yeah, yeah. Very funny.
Also, my name isn't even Hikitani.
Hikigaya
Yahello!
Hey.
You're coming to club today, right?
Yeah.
Okay, I'll see you there!
Hachiman...
I heard we're going to be picking groups for
the field trip in our next long homeroom.
Yeah?
I'd say everyone's pretty much decided already, though.
You think so? I haven't decided yet...
I want to protect this smile!
Want to be in the same group, then?
Sure!
Yeah, that's true.
Hello, hello!
Hayato-kun, where've you been?
Going off on your own like that... Are you Whattytani-kun?
At least let me go to the bathroom by myself.
Also, you use that joke too much, Tobe.
Huh?!
Yeah, go overboard with that and you'll flop.
It's bound Tobe a flop!
I'm the joke now? Gimme a break, seriously!
Thanks!
Your tea's getting cold.
I don't like hot stuff...
You know, I wish our school could've gone to Okinawa, too.
What is there to do in Kyoto, anyway?
There are plenty of things to do.
Like seeing and experiencing Japan's culture firsthand...
I don't think that's what it's about.
Oh? Why are we going on this field trip, then?
It's an imitation of social living.
Huh?
On a business trip with your superior,
you don't get to choose where you stay or what you have for dinner.
This trains you to fool yourself into thinking that by compromising,
you get some enjoyment out of it.
I bet you're no fun to go on a field trip with, Hikki.
There must be something you two are looking forward to.
Maybe...
Bathing with Totsuka?
I haven't looked into it at all yet.
What about you?
Well, I'm looking forward to seeing Ryouanji and Kiyomizudera,
but I'd also like to see famous places like Rokuonji and Jishouji.
Rokuonjishouji?
Don't combine them.
That sounds like some cool name for a character.
I suppose Kinkaku and Ginkaku are their more common names.
Then why didn't you just call them that?
Also...
I think that's about it.
You know a lot!
What are you, Jalan?
I think she's a little too excited about this...
Isn't familiarity with Kyoto considered common knowledge?

What?
Nothing, nothing!
Come in.
Hey.
Do you have business with us?
He wanted some help, so I brought him here.
Wait, I don't think I can ask Hikitani-kun for help, after all.
What?
We're the ones who came to ask for help.
Yeah, but you know, I can't tell Hikitani-kun about stuff like this.
He doesn't seem trustworthy at all.
Snap.
Tobecchi, was that really necessary?
Well, it's Hikigaya-kun's fault. We can't help that.
It's only natural.
Then, forgive my asking, but would you leave?
Okay, call me whenever you're done with stuff.
Hold it. Where are you going?
Huh?
I was asking them to leave.
No manners, no sense of propriety.
I don't see why we need to do any favors for someone like that.
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave right away.
Yeah, you're kinda rude!
Well... I guess we were wrong.
Tobe, let's go.
We should figure this out ourselves.
No, I can't back out of this now!
Look, the thing is, I...
For real?!
So basically, you want to ask Ebina-san to go out with you?
Yeah, something like that!
It'd hurt to get rejected, you know?
You don't want to get rejected, huh...
I love that sort of thing!
We'll back you up!
I guess it won't be that easy, huh?
Well, I'd say not.
Sorry, but it looks like we can't be of any help.
Aww, why not? Let's help him!
Wait a minute.
Don't try to force this decision on me.
Hikitani-kun... I mean...
Hikitani-san, please!
Wait, wait. You're trying to look polite,
Please!
but you lapped yourself and just ended up more impolite.
And you're still getting my name wrong.
Please, please!
Yukinon, this is really bothering Tobecchi.
Well, if you insist, I'll think about it.
Um, Yukinoshita-san?
You're a bit too soft on Yuigahama-san lately.
All right, let's do this.
So, what exactly do you want us to do?
Well, you know, I tell her I like her, right?
So you help me do that?
Aww!
Okay, it's clear what you're after.
But isn't that a little risky?
Risky?
A risk.
It means there's a possibility of danger or loss.
I know what it means! I meant, what kind of risk?
Well, he tells her, right? Then she rejects him, right?
That's already established?!
Not only that.
It's a given that the whole class will know about it the next day.
If they just know about it, that's fine,
but you'll hear it from all around...
Hey, I heard Hikigaya told Kaori he liked her.
Eww, poor Kaori!
I'm glad I didn't give him my address!
You're safe. He wouldn't say that to you.
Then you'll come up in their merry little conversations.
There is a risk that you'll be slightly hurt.
You were talking about yourself again.
I've got more.
Such as, what happens after you tell someone you're friends
with that you like them...
Okay, we get the point.
We'll take care of that part.
Well, I've gotta get to my club.
So, let's start by looking for Tobe-kun's good points.
I'm friends with Hayato-kun?
You're already relying on someone else!
Got anything else?
Uh... He's cheerful?
If cheerfulness were enough, bald guys could be popular.
You, Yukinoshita?
Let me see...
He's loud... No, he's noisy... Raucous...
He's very lively?
How's that?
Okay, I got it.
We're changing plans.
That was fast!
Instead of looking for Tobe's good points,
let's try appealing to what Ebina-san likes.
Oh, I get it!
By the way, how does Ebina-san feel about Tobe-kun?
Huh?
G-Good question...
Ah. Looks like we've got our answer.
Oh, man! You totally got me all curious!
Are you sure?
You know what this is, right? The final judgment.
Nah, I can't move forward if I don't know the answer to that!
Okay, go ahead.
She thinks you're a nice guy... I think.
Ugh, I could cry...
When a girl says a guy is nice,
that means she couldn't care less about him.
That's a plus for me, right?
The only plus here is your outlook.
I've got it!
You get a good mood going while we're exploring Kyoto!
Hina said she likes Kyoto, so I think it'll work!
That means we'll have to create a situation in which Tobe-kun
and Ebina-san are together, right?
Come in.
Sorry to interrupt.
Oh...
Hina-chan!
Hey, Yui. Hello, hello.
Yahello!
What is that? Some tribe's traditional greeting?
And Yukinoshita-san and Hikitani-kun, hello, hello!
Hi.
Please sit wherever you like.
What's up?
Well, actually...
I wanted to talk to you about Tobecchi...
T-T-T-Tobecchi?! What about him?
Well, Tobecchi...
Tobecchi...?
Tobecchi...
really well with Hayato-kun and Hikitani-kun lately,
and I think it's making Ohoka-kun and Yamato-kun frustrated!
I want to see more depraved relationships between them!
This is ruining their triangle heart!
Um...
Tobecchi's been talking to Hikitani-kun a lot lately, right?
And giving him suggestive looks...
Listen, if you're going to invite someone,
I wish you'd invite all of them.
And then accept all of them.
To cut to the chase, I want you to seduce them.
Nope. Not happening.
What are you saying?
Well, it feels like that whole group isn't the same now.
But there's some complicated stuff that goes on between guys, isn't there?
Like relationships with others...
Complicated relationships between boys...
Goodness, Yui, how lewd.
Did I say something weird?!
No, what you said was perfectly respectable. Don't worry.
But it's definitely something that's never happened before,
and I guess I don't like that.
I want them to get along as well as they always have.
Oh, but I think it'd be great if you'd get along with them, too, Hikitani-kun!
It'd be a feast for my eyes, too.
Well, I'll be looking forward to some...
tasty developments on the field trip.
Invite them!
Counting on you, Hikitani-kun!
What was that?
No idea.
Anyway, we just need to make sure they can all get along, right?
Yeah...
But, Hikki, how do guys get to be friends?
Don't you think it's a bit cruel to ask that of Hikigaya-kun?
Yuigahama-san, try to be a little more considerate, okay?
Yeah, what you just said. Be more considerate.

Hmm...
So, how should we sit?
However we want?
I want a window seat.
Thanks, Hayato.
Come on, Yui, Ebina.
Okay, Hina can sit there, and Tobecchi can sit next to...
Okay, Yui, you sit there.
I'm sitting here.
Kawasaki-san, you're across from me.
N-No, I'll sit somewhere el
Just come on!
Where should we sit?
Hachiman...
Whew, this isn't easy.
Did something happen with them?
Well...
Tobecchi's so freaked out with Kawasaki-san next to him,
he can't keep up a conversation at all.
Saki-san, do you think a window seat or an aisle seat is more uke?
Hina-chan is even more incredible than usual, though...
That's a disaster for Tobe, too.
I hope they'll have time to be alone...
I don't think anything would happen if those two were alone, though.
True...
You mean Tobe-kun's...
Sai-chan, you heard us?
Yeah... But I found out about it over summer break, in Chiba Village.
Right, Hachiman?
Y-Yeah.
I actually think Ebina-san's pretty cool.
Oh, it's Mount Fuji! Look, over there!
He's close...
I wanna see, too!
Wow! Mount Fuji's so pretty!
You know, innocent moves like that
will give most guys the wrong idea
and put them in a position no better than death.
If you understand that, never touch a guy,
sit in a guy's chair during breaks or after school,
or borrow from a guy if you forget something, ever again.
Listen...
Okay...
I'm gonna get back to my seat.
Uh, Hachiman...
Is that... long enough?
S-Sorry!
Hikki!
Got a second?
Later.
Did you forget we have work to do?
I already called Tobecchi and Hina! Hurry up!

It looks pitch dark.
If we all go in at different times, they can be alone, right?
Yeah...
Okay, let's go through here in pairs!
Yumiko and Hayato-kun can go first.
We'll go last.
We don't have much time,
so we probably shouldn't leave too much space between us.
True.
Yeah, but this doesn't look like it'll take long, so it should be fine.
Well, you can't go wrong in getting back early.
C'mon, let's just go, Hayato.
It looks fun.
See you guys on the other side.
Man, it's seriously dark in here!
This is it! This is as dark as dark gets!
Yep.
We're supposed to turn this stone and make a wish.
Did you decide what to wish for?
Yeah.
Okay, let's turn it together.
That's what you do at a shrine.
All done?
Uh... Yeah.
Okay! Then, let's go!

All right! I got very good luck!
Hey, but y'know what that means.
It can only go up from here, so it's good, right?
Maybe...
Hey.
If you're going to tie it on, the higher you put it, the better.
Here, let me do that.
Thanks. Glad I had a guy around.
He's trying pretty hard, even without our help.
I hope it'll keep going so well.
Yeah.
You think everyone's wishing for romance?
Huh? Yeah...
What is she doing?
That's really good!
Here, Hikki.
I keep telling you...
Nah, that's... I shouldn't... Not right after you did.
Y-You don't have to worry about that...
I will worry about it!
Besides, if I drank from that, I wouldn't notice how it tasted at all.

Souvenirs
Well, what a coincidence.
That's what you should've said a second ago.
What's wrong?
Felt uncomfortable in your room, so you ran away?
If I ran away over that, I wouldn't go on field trips.
You?
The topic of conversation among my classmates turned toward me.
Why do they enjoy talking about things like that?
But if they're talking about you, doesn't it mean they're interested in you?
Why don't you make friends with them?
You say that as if it's no problem of yours,
but it's all because of what you did at the cultural festival.
Huh? Me?
Hang on. This isn't my fault.
It's society's fault.
And? How's that service request going?
Neither good nor bad, I guess.
Sorry I can't help very much, since I'm in a different class.
Don't worry about it.
I'm in their class, and I haven't done a thing.
You should worry about that.
Man, that was good!
It was certainly an intense flavor.
Accurate.
But why did we have to come with you?
Should a teacher be doing this?
You know I shouldn't.
That's why I bought your silence with ramen.
That's an even worse thing for a teacher to do.
If you're caught, you'll get in trouble.
Being scolded isn't a bad thing.
It means someone is looking out for you.
I'm looking out for you guys, too,
so make all the mistakes you want.
I'm going to buy some liquor for the party.
Later. Be careful getting back.
Turn right here.
O-Oh...
If you walk that far behind, you'll get lost again.
You could just go on ahead.
I don't see much point in that.
It's right there.
Maybe you don't, but it bothers me.
What does?
Well...
It's late at night...
If anyone sees us together...
O-Oh, right...

Later, then.
Yeah. Goodnight.
Um...
Thanks for walking me back.

Is there anywhere you'd like to go, Hachiman?
Well, no matter where we go, we'll be together...
Or I should say, as long as we're together, anywhere's great.
That's just like you, Hachiman.
I think I'd like to see Studio Park and Arashiyama.
Ah, Arashiyama has hot springs...
Wh-What? Hot springs?!
Huh? T-Totsuka?
Hachiman...
Shut up! Zaimokuza, you're too loud! Keep it down!
