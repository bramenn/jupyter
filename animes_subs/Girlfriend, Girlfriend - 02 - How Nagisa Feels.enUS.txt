I got a boyfriend recently.
Naoya is way too proper, and he can be a bit weird,
but he really cherishes me.
Or so I thought!
Now he tells me that he wants to date this other girl, Nagisa-chan, who confessed to him.
That asshole declared that he wants to date both of us!
The Grovel
And now the three of us are living together at his place!
The Three of Us
Living Together
What's going to happen to us?!
I don't think I can go through with this.
There are way too many problems with him dating the two of us.
And my rival just has to be so...
So cute and big-boobed and irresistible!
Why did a girl like her have to ask out Naoya?
I'd like to do it with both of you... the three of us, together!
That pervert!
That guy!
Wait... Oh, right!
You must be sick of him now that you know what a freak he is!
If it's something Naoya-kun wants, I wouldn't mind a th-threesome.
C-Cute, big-boobed, and horny as hell...
H-Horny as hell?!
Even I want to be your girlfriend!
Huh?
Saki-san?
No, I'm completely losing here.
Naoya might lose interest in me if Nagisa-chan seduced him.
Hey, I set up our futons.

How Nagisa Feels
Wh-Wh-Why are there three futons lined up?!
I thought we might be able to get closer if we talked in bed.
Y-Y-You're going to try to pull something naughty, aren't you?!
Especially on Nagisa-chan!
No, I promised I wouldn't!
But if I were you, I totally would!
In that case...
I'll have to have my dick surgically removed.
That's too extreme!
Fine, then. You scare me.
Th-Thanks.
But...
Is it okay with you, Minase-san?
Nagisa-chan might be the one to start something.
O-Of course. Yes.
She's a total pervert.
Prevention
Whatever!
I won't let them have their way!
I'm going to watch them all night.
Saki-chan...
Thank you for putting up with my selfishness.
Saki-chan?
She must be tired. Maybe she's fallen asleep.
It was a busy day.
And all my fault!
So, what's your move?
Um, Naoya-kun...
May I come closer to you for a bit?
N-Nagisa!
Minase-san?
You're going to do him already?!
Are you a slut?
Is Nagisa a slut?!
I see.
You must be lonely, being here in an unfamiliar place.
I-I am.
Well? Is that better?
You adorable little slut!
I can't believe I'm sleeping with the person I've always liked.
It's like a dream.
Sleeping with, in a dirty way, right?
I'd like to get to know you a lot better, Naoya-kun.
In a sexy way!
Minase-san...
I want you to tell me more about you, too.
In a sexy way, Naoya?!
Naoya-kun...
If you do that, I'll...
Is it her boobs? Are you squeezing her boobs?
Sorry, did you not like that?
No, it just startled me a little.
But...
I'm so happy.
Don't be happy about it!
I wouldn't mind doing this forever.
She's totally enjoying it!
You're making me so happy.
I'm going to lose my mind.
Naoya hasn't done anything with me yet!
You totally put it in!
Put what in?
Naoya, you idiot! Idiot! Idiot!
H-Huh?
It's not in.
What's the matter, Saki-chan?
No, I, you s-see...
What do you mean, put it in?
Are you all right?
N-No, I m-mean...
I mean...
I'm going to put myself in your futon, too.
Kill me.
Just kill me.
Were you...
You must have been feeling lonely, too.
Y-Yes.
You're cute when you act lonely, too, Saki-chan.
Let's sleep together tonight, the three of us.
Y-Yay.
I'm so happy.
She definitely had the wrong idea.

U-Um... And lucky panties.
Naoya, snacks please.
I never would have thought Naoya-kun would suggest dating Saki-san along with me.
This relationship...
It's great.
Sure, there are some things about it that aren't,
but I get to date my beloved Naoya-kun.
That outweighs all of it.
And we get to live under the same roof.
We're even sleeping on the same futon.
But I don't think this is going to last forever.
If Saki-san gets fed up with this arrangement,
I'm probably going to be the one who gets dumped.
Still, if I work hard in the limited time I have,
and I make myself indispensable to them...
I'll be able to enjoy this happiness for one day longer.
Mizuse Nagisa is modest
I might even become Naoya-kun's favorite.
But how do I do that?
Naoya-kun and Saki-san's smartphones.

Chunks of personal information!
I can't make this arrangement last by being nice.
If I can find naughty sites in his browsing history,
I might even learn about what kind of girls he likes.
B-But what if he has really crazy tastes?
I-I'd still accept it, though.
But I'm not emotionally prepared for this.
Okay.
I'll start with Saki-san's smartphone.
I have to get to know Saki-san in order to make this work.
First, her browser history...

You suck, Naoya!
I can't believe you want to date two girls!
I hope your dick rots off!
She's definitely angry.
No, that would be a problem...
Maybe not that...
She's talking about sex again!
She queeted about me.
Nagisa-chan's too cute.
I really don't want her to be the girl I share a guy with...
But...
She's such a good girl, and she's cute...

I-I-I-It's not what you think!
My friend kept griping that she hasn't done it yet, so I...
I'm really sorry!
I mean... I-I don't really know what you're into, but...
It's not what you think! I swear!
I think it's all right, whatever you're interested in!
J-Just kill me!
What are you trying to accomplish, Naoya?!
I, uh...
I just wanted to learn about you more!
I promise I'll accept you for whomever you might be!
Just forget it all!
Naoya-kun!
A-Are you all right?
I'm going to sleep to try to forget it, too.
I'm sorry. It was my fault.
It's fine.
I get that you wanted to look because you were worried about me dating two girls.
Let me do this much.

No, I'm not really an otaku...
She didn't know what to bring now that she's living with Naoya and Saki, so she panicked and brought maid clothes that she bought from D*n Quijote.

What was I thinking?

Yum!
You're such a good cook, Nagisa-chan.
She forgot after she slept
She actually forgot
By the way, which class are you in?
You're a first-year, too, right?
Um...
I think I'm in Class B.
Huh? So are we.
Have I ever seen you in class?
Um...
I've been away from school.
Really?
Is something wrong?
I wanted Naoya to like me, so I was studying cooking and stuff...
And I didn't have time to go to school.
But it's all good now that I get to go out with you.
Wh-What...
What are you doing?!
How could you be so insane?!
Y-You've sacrificed too much!
Nagisa-chan, are you actually kind of messed up?
You put too much on the line! I'm worried for you!
I-I... uh...
Now that he mentions it, he's right!
Is that the only crazy thing you've done?
I think so.
Th-This is bad.
Naoya-kun's going to think less of me!
I have to impress him and redeem myself!
Shall I make you some snacks?
Really?
This isn't the time!
Minase-san...
We're going to spend all day studying together.
But I'm a really bad student...

You're behind in school, aren't you?
I can't just let that be!
W-Well...
You, too, Saki-chan.
I don't want him to lose any more faith in me.
I'm sure you can catch up if you try!
I'll just have to give it all I've got.
P-Please and thank you.
I'll do my best to teach you.
Let's start with the basics of factoring.
You just have to use the formula. It's easy.
I-I'll try.
What about you, Saki-chan?
This is easy.
Even though I hate studying.
Thank goodness. That's correct.
Minase-san, did you get it?
U-Um...
Minase-san?
You can't do it?
N-No, I...
I-I'm going to the bathroom.
I don't get any of it.
He's going to think I'm stupid.
He'll lose even more faith in me.

Do you think she's sick?
Um...
Minase-san, are you okay?
Are you feeling sick?
Shoot, I've been in here for half an hour.
Y-Yeah, actually...
I'll call the ambulance right away!
I'm just fine!
Wh-Which is it?
You've been in there for a long time!
H-Hey!
Don't be so insensitive!
But...
I can't keep this up!
Are you okay, though? Minase-san?
But I don't want Naoya-kun to think I'm stupid.
Seriously!
But...
I-I'm just really backed up!
Naoya, you...
S-Sorry...
I'm really sorry!
N-No, it's okay.
I think I protected my reputation, but I feel like I've lost something else.
But...
I'm going to overcome this, especially now that I have to redeem myself!
I want to look good in Naoya-kun's eyes.
I want him to like me, even just a little more.
I want to stay with him, even just a little longer.
I got it!
Naoya-kun!
Minase-san...
I'm really sorry.
D-Don't worry about it.
So, factoring, right?
Um...
It's like this, and...
There!
Of course I can do it.
You got it wrong.
Huh?
Don't worry!
Everyone's bad at something.
You don't have to worry about it.
I'll stick with you for as many hours as it takes.
N-Naoya-kun...
But...
It's not that I'm bad at it!

Listen.
You can't let anyone at school know about our relationship.
You mean about me dating two people?
Obviously.
Then what about Minase-san and us?
We'll be strangers.
N-No way!
I can't leave her to be by herself after she missed so much school!
We haven't done anything wrong!
It's bad for our reputation!
You understand, right, Nagisa-chan?
Yes.
Are you sure, Minase-san?
I haven't been to school for a while,
so I don't have any friends to tell, anyway.
That's so sad.
A-Anyway, if you want to keep dating both of us, you have to keep it a secret.
R-Right.
Who's she, again?
She's so cute.
Have you seen her before?
Hey, do you recognize her at all?
She's been out of school all this time, right?
I wonder what happened.
Did the teacher say anything?
I mean, I feel bad for Nagisa-chan.
But everyone already knows I'm in a relationship with Naoya.
I can't tell them he's seeing her, too!
This is bad.
No one's talking to Minase-san.
She's going to be a loner forever.
All right...
Hey!
I have to take care of this.
U-Um...
Naoya-kun!
N-Nice to meet you.
I'm Mukai Naoya.
N-Nice to meet you, right.
I'm Minase.
Such a lonesome face...
Naoya?
I can't.
I can't keep lying like this!
I'm...
dating Minase-san and Saki
Wh-What were you about to say?
D-Don't stop me.
This lie is only going to hurt Minase-san!
We and Minase-san are...
Who is she?!
We aren't strangers!
We live to
I told you to keep it a secret!
B-But...
I don't want her to look so sad.
I-I mean, I get it, but...
I can't have everyone finding out you're dating another girl.
People are going to think you don't care about me.
I don't want that!
S-Saki-chan...
I still love you, Saki-chan.
So...
People will understand if I explain!
Die.
I-I'm...
I'll be okay.
Minase-san...
I'm more than happy enough just being able to be with you at home.
So please don't fight.
Nagisa-chan...
But actually... I want to apologize for one thing.
I woke up early and made lunch for the three of us.
Come to think of it, I obviously wouldn't have been able to eat with you.
I'm so stupid.
You two have it together later.
I'd appreciate your feedback once we get home.
I'll eat alone in the restroom so people don't find out we're having the same lunch.
Nagisa-chan!
Minase-san!
I've been so selfish.
I'm sorry for pretending we're strangers!
Saki-san...
Can I tell people about us, then?
W-Well...

Let's hang out in secret at school.
