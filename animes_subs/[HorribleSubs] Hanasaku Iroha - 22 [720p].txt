Good morning, everyone!
It's a beautiful day!
Huh? Takako?
What? It's four in the morning...
The early bird catches the worm!
Not only do you have
your regular duties at the inn to take care of,
you also have to help with the preparations for our wedding!
Thus, I've concluded that cutting the sleeping time
of you young ones, will be
the first step to making this a success.
What?
Anyway, you now have a meeting with Enishing you must attend.
Here we go, to the staff dining room!
I wonder why Takako's so fired up suddenly.
Episode 22 A Determined One-Sided Crush
Good morning, Ms. Tomoe!
Let's begin a wonderful day!
Hey!
Oh... sorry.
Come on, have a seat like everyone else, Ms. Tomoe.
We'll now begin the meeting.
Let's get fired up!
Are you ready?
Anyway, what led Ryunosuke Akutagawa to write Rashomon?
His wedding with Yayoi Yoshida,
a girl he'd known since he was a child, had been called off...
Hey!
Oh... I'm sorry!
It never rings, so I...
Huh? What about your boyfriend?
Now's not a good time to bring up stuff like-
I'm sorry.
What were you thinking?!
I can't believe you called me in the middle of class.
Sorry, sorry.
I just have this image of you constantly at work.
I forgot that you're a high schooler.
So, what do you need?
Oh, I received an invitation.
Enishi's getting married, huh?
Yeah!
You're coming, right?
It isn't that simple.
What? You're busy with work?
I've got a lot to take care of.
I'll send him a congratulatory message, though.
Enishi, huh...
He's streaked ahead of you, huh?
Hush.
Hey, your relationships with your boyfriends last too long, don't they?
What?
What does it mean to you when you go out with someone?
What? You've gone and caught yourself another boyfriend?
N-No!
Hmm...
Maybe it's because I still have a one-sided crush on your father.
What?!
A one-sided crush?!
You didn't have to scream at me.
I thought I said something nice for a change.
A one-sided crush?!
I didn't expect those words
from my sex crazed mother.
Jeez...
I want to find a new love because
I can't forget my old one.
I couldn't get anything out of that love.
But, well, it's been 15 years since your father died.
Recently, I've been thinking that maybe
I don't need to get anything out of it.
Why not?
It's once in a lifetime that you meet someone you love so much.
Maybe the fact that I met him
was lucky in itself.
Huh?
Ohana?
What?
Hearing her talk about her one-sided crush made
my heart beat so fast!
Jeez!
One-sided crush?
Why...
Why did I try to forget about Ko?
Minchi is so serious about Tohru...
Why did I think I couldn't have a one-sided crush on him?
Home Economics Room
Okay, it's done!
Wow! Amazing!
Yeah!
It's not bad for an amateur's work.
All that's left is for someone to try it on,
so we can make some minor adjustments.
Could you try it on, Yuina?
What? I don't want to.
I hear that putting on a wedding dress
delays your marriage in the future.
If I tried it, I'd be dragging the bottom...
I feel like this is deja vu...
Not a pleasant deja vu either...
C-Can I take this off now?
What should we do...
Tomoe is doing our share of the duties at the inn right now, so...
Oh, we should ask Tsurugi to try it on, then!
She may not be as... big as Takako there,
but as long as hers aren't bigger, she can try it on!
As long as hers aren't bigger!
Right?
Looks like we're done for today.
You're going to start practicing making the dishes for the party now?
Yup.
I sort of have an idea, but...
Minko...
Umm, I...
I told you, I don't need your help.
Hey...
It's fine. I've decided to stop spoiling her.
Huh?
I noticed that you have to be hard on them when they're in a slump,
in order for them to overcome it.
Just like how you were ruthless with me back then.
R-Ruth... less?
Minchi sure is late...
Yeah...
Minchi!
We all made this together,
but there are some minor adjustments we need to make, so...
No, I refuse.
What?
I hate wearing things with frills.
B-But, Minchi...
Shut up!
Wait, Minchi!
I don't mind that you dislike me,
but we made that dress
together with Yuina for Takako and the young master's wedding!
We worked really hard on it!
How could you-
Shut up!
Worked really hard?
So has Tohru!
But you stepped all over his feelings for you!
What? T-Tohru?
I-I've decided that I have a one-sided crush on Ko!
I'm going to be direct like you, Minchi!
So I'm-
Cut the crap!
Die!
Why do you have a crush?!
Just go out with Tohru!
Die! Die! Die!
No!
If I die, I won't be able to go out with anyone!
Besides, I've already decided that I have a crush on Ko!
I've decided!
Why?!
He's just some loser!
M-Minchi!
You've never even seen him!
Anyone's a loser compared to Tohru!
Minchi!
Tohru's so handsome! He's perfect!
Both of you, stop already!
Minko, you...
Wait, Minchi!
What are you? Stupid?
What?
Well... you're right. I'm kind of interested in Ohana.
Perhaps I do like her.
But it's not like I want to do anything.
I just get excited watching her,
trying to imagine what kind of crazy stunt she'll pull next.
On the other hand, you keep me in great suspense.
H-Hey...
Sorry, did I just say something awful?!
No... No, it's just...
I'm happy...
You're willing to watch over me without even liking me...
You really are stupid, aren't you?
I've got most of the dirt off.
Ohana!
Wh-What?
I was really moved!
I've never been in love before,
but I thought what you said was wonderful.
Wonderful?
Yeah, about continuing your crush.
Fighting isn't nice, but I think both of you are wonderful.
You're both able to love someone so much.
I'm so moved!
Nakochi...
What do you mean, I'm moved?
Minchi!
Okay.
Wow! It looks great on you!
Hey, we should get her to hold some white flowers!
I've seen it on TV!
It's supposed to make it more appealing, right?
I'll borrow the flowers by the staircase!
N-Nakochi?
Is your nose okay?
Y-Yeah, absolutely.
See-
I won't give up.
What?
I'm not giving up.
A-As in you're going to try and force me to go out with Tohru?
No!
I want to go out with him, so...
I'm not going to give that up.
I want to go out with him,
so I'm going to continue my crush.
Minchi...
I'm going to be direct like you said, so...
Balut!
O-Ohana? Did you two fight ag-
Balut is back!
And after that, the preparations for the wedding went smoothly.
I sort of decided...
that I'd confess to Ko after the wedding.
Wow, amazing!
Perfect!
You decorated in even the smallest of places!
Thanks. I have the feeling that this will
Thank you so much!
be a wonderful wedding thanks to you all.
This is wonderful!
I think so too!
Minchi, this way!
Please excuse us!
You're so pretty, Takako...
Of course!
This is the day a woman looks the prettiest in her life!
In a woman's life...
I have a favor to ask you.
About the bouquet toss...
All right!
I haven't seen you since college.
When did you start dating Takako?
W-Well...
We've become bride and groom on this day,
and we're so happy to be able to announce
this to you all this afternoon.
We swear to work together as a married couple,
and to start up a warm, happy family.
Okay, bring it on!
The wedding ceremony's over!
Now we're in a race against time!
Okay!
What should I do...
I'm nervous about being the master of ceremonies...
Hey, Oshimizu,
does my hair look fine? Is it weird?
It looks fine! Later!
Oshimizu looks so nice when she's hustling!
A kitchen is a battlefield! Let's go!
Yes, sir!
Good!
Tohru, give me some orders.
Huh?
You're in charge today.
Okay!
Could you parboil those vegetables,
descale the carp,
fry those,
and decorate the dishes with the cucumbers?
Th-That's quite a lot of work.
Okay, I'd like to read the congratulatory greetings now.
This is from the groom's older sister, Satsuki Matsumae.
They always say that a relationship gets better after a stormy fight,
but I'm not sure what the weather is like today.
Either way, you need to make sure she's wet, all right?
Oh, Mom...
What about the next dish?
The previous one was the last of them.
Great work today, everyone!
Invitations?
We're invited to the wedding too!
You look so pretty, Takako.
Thanks.
Wow, these are all so delicious!
It's the first time I've tasted Tohru's cooking like this.
This is...
Sorry... I couldn't stop him from doing this.
So, for our next performance...
Where art thou?!
Oh, where art thou, my destined love!
There you are!
My beloved... Takako!
Wh-What in the world?!
Now, for the baiser amor!
W-
Wait-
Don't react, or you'll lose.
On a morning without clocks,
two lovers smile and laugh while being embraced by the white clouds.
Sunlight shines through a tiny gap,
and birds are singing freely beyond the windowsill.
Time will extend as long as their hands are held tight;
a short eternity is born.
I didn't help out with this wedding at all.
But these two, and the young workers at Kissuiso,
have created such an incredible ceremony.
I apologize for boring you with stories of my past,
but 40 years ago, I created Kissuiso
with my late husband, and with Denroku...
No, with Mr. Denroku.
That's what it means to be young.
Even if you stumble and get lost,
you challenge yourself to new things.
You'll be able to create something new.
I look forward to seeing the new things these two,
and the rest of Kissuiso create,
while I'll sit back and enjoy my tea from the far distance.
Everyone's future?
Watching from afar?
It ended without any troubles.
Yeah.
Looks like everything's just about cleaned up.
Madam Manager,
about that speech you gave earlier...
The reason why I asked you all here...
is because Mr. Denroku told me the other day...
This...
that he wanted someone
to succeed the logs he kept for over 40 years.
Does that mean you're quitting Kissuiso, Beanman?!
But, why?
These logs are like a history book of Kissuiso.
The tears, the laughs... everything is written in here.
Look how worn it is.
I'm thinking about sealing Kissuiso, along with these logs,
after the Bonbori festival this year.
You going to see him?
What?
Your crush.
Oh...
A man is responsible for waiting patiently.
Ohana, you're nothing like a bland coffee.
