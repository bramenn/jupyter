Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
Well, if you'll let me eat you, I'll tell you.
The one who reigns!
Mask of flesh, all creation, flap of wings...
the one who carries the title of human!
In the name of truth and temperance,
dig your claws into the wall of sinless dreams!
Destruction Spell 33...
Pale Fire Crash!
Good, at least this much of my powers are back... Huh?
Ridiculous! It didn't even scratch him!
But yours is so weak. I felt nothing.
Dammit!
As I thought, my Kido hasn't recovered enough to use a spell of that level.
How many years has it been
since I last saw Karin cry?
Until our mom died, Karin was a crybaby, just like Yuzu.
After she died, Yuzu, who was the clever and responsible one,
tried to fill in for our mom, and began to take over the housekeeping.
Karin, who wasn't good at much of anything,
stopped crying altogether so as not to worry the rest of us.
Even when she lost a fight with an upperclassman,
or when she hit a ball through the window
of the principal's office and was reprimanded,
or when she broke her leg while hiking,
she never cried once.
Karinleave this to me.
Are you really a Soul Reaper?
Why don't you take off that human form?
Huh?!!
Ohdid Iget him?
Huh? He hit a Hollow?
Can he see spirits?
Nomaybe not
What's this he just happened to hit me?
I thought he could see me-
There I got'im
I-Impossible
He shouldn't be seeing the Hollow, much less hearing his voice
He's calmly facing down an enemy he cannot even sense
Doesn't he have any fear?
Damn
Bet you can't touch me here!
What are you going to do, you good-for-nothing Soul Reaper?
Don't just stand there! Get away! He's up in the air!
Transfer student You can see ghosts?
Never mind about that! In any case, at that distance
Where is he? What?
He's flying isn't he? In which direction?
What good would knowing that do?
I'd do this
Now, what shall I do?
Shall I do a hit-and-run and snatch him like a falcon?
What is this?!
Nowwhere is he?
Right there! Swing down right there!
Now, give up.
Someone's on his way to finish you off.
What's so funny?
No wonder you Soul Reapers,
the whole bunch of you, are always getting beaten by us!
Looks like the shoe's on the other foot.
You Soul Reapers take us too lightly.
That's why you end up like this.
Nowwho shall I start eating? I think I'll save the guy for last.
What?!
T-This is crazy!
You think you can solve all your problems with muscle?
You muscle-headed idiot?!
UghThis one's got such sharp instincts!
This way, Chad! Kick the air above me!
Damn!!
No! Not there! Up above!
In the sky?!
I have an idea!
Transfer student
Will this really work?
Yes. We'll utilize your strength and my brains.
What can I say?
This don't seem smart at all.
I don't have to take that from you!
Let's go! In the direction of the tiger!
Which way is the tiger?
Humph! Left!
Left
You fool! That's too high!
Okay, here we go.
If I'm this far up in the air, no electric pole will reach me.
Fire!!
Give up!
O-Okay! I-I give up!
Just kidding!
W-What happened?
S-Sorry about that. He caught me by surprise.
Damn! What in the world are these leeches?!
Exactly!
They won't come off easily
Besides, they're my targets!
Transfer student!?
W-What happened?
Are you surprised?!
Those leeches are small bombs.
They respond to sounds from my tongue, and explode!
Your guard was wide open.
You wanna take me on, you lummox? But you
Oh!
I get it He ran off a while ago to gain some time to bring this here?!
I'm sorry, Mister He caught me
Shibata
Looks like you understand now, big boy.
Now, it's time for us to play, Soul Reaper!
Now run! Let me enjoy hunting you down!
Don't move from here, Chad
If you take even a step, he plans to blow up that birdcage.
Transfer student, what about you?
You needn't worry about me! I gave my word
not to foul up!
Your word?
This is getting fun!
You're covered with them!
How niceto see you covered in blood.
You're so pretty!
I can hardlywait!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
How long do you intend to keep running?
You can turn around and attack me, if you like!
Well?! Soul Reaper!
Huh? What is it?
Have you given up already?
That's no fun.
Come on, run, will you?
I haven't given up
I have no need to run anymore.
What?
You said that I could attack you, didn't you?
In that case, I will take you at your word.
In that case, I will take you at your word.
RightIchigo?
What do you mean, Right, Ichigo?
Didn't you promise to not worry me by fouling up?
Fool! That's a line for someone who's even a little bit worried, to say.
I guess you're right.
Damn you!
How long do you intend to sit on my head!!
Ichigo Kurosaki, 15 years old!
Currently a surrogate Soul Reaper!
If you want to chase someone,
aren't you running after the wrong person?
Surrogate Soul Reaper?
Damn! If that's soI should have
gone after you from the start!
Ichigo!
You slowpoke!
You look the tastiest
I see. So you used those bombs to pin Chad down
so you could enjoy attacking a girl?
You're nothing but a stinking pig!!
But now you're gonna be eaten by that stinking pig.
I-Ichigo?!
What's wrong, Ichigo?
Chad! Perfect timing.
Go and hide him and the parakeet somewhere safe.
Transfer student What is this?
Don't worry. He's now
in the middle of a battle!
Good move.
But remember, the leeches, that flowed out of their bodies
are also bombs!
There's something I want to ask you.
Are you the one who killed the parents
of the kid inside the parakeet?
What?
He said it's all my fault.
Because of me, the man and the girl got hurt.
Shibata
It's all because I wanted to bring my mom back to life.
I'm sorry
I want my mom to come back to life.
But...
Wait!
Did someone tell you
that he would bring your mother back to life?
Did someone tell you there was a way to do that?
That's right.
I'm the one who killed that kid's mother while I was still alive.
At the time, I was a serial killer. It was all over TV
I was famous.
That kid's mother was my last victim.
It was so much fun
She ran as hard as she could.
She barely had any breath left, but she still tried to protect her kid.
It was such a thrill.
But that's where it went wrong.
I chased her out onto her veranda
That kid! He grabbed my shoe laces
Who woulda thought I'd get killed by a slip up like that?
I decided to pay that kid back.
Three months! If you can run around in that form for that long,
I would bring his mother back to life.
Bring her back to life?
Fool! Of course, I couldn't do that bring a dead person back to life!
But that kid believed me.
He ran as hard as he could.
What's fun about this penalty game is that
I could kill off any and everyone who tried to protect the kid.
And each time, the kid would whine and beg to quit.
He didn't like it, he said.
That's when I used my clincher
Your mother is waiting for you to save her!
Hearing that, he would always regain his will.
He'd cry, Mom! Mom!
What are you sympathizing with him for?!
You dropped your guard!
This is the end for you!!
You can have this bomb back.
What's wrong? You're going to set it off, aren't you?
Come on and click your tongue!
Aren't you going to click your tongue?
In that case I'll take your tongue!
Ah, my tongue!
Get lost!
Wha..?!
It is Hell
The Zanpaku-to can only wash away sins committed after death.
For Hollows that committed major sins before their death
the Gates of the Netherworld will open!
Sohe's gone to hell?
Well?
It's unfortunate, but
his chain of fate has been severed; there's no sign of it.
There's no way I can return him to his body.
No
Shibata
Don't worry! Soul Society isn't a scary place!
You'll never get hungry, and your body will feel light.
You'll probably find it a better place than this!
Oh? You can say that when you're just a hanger-on?
But, that might be true.
At least, if you go over, you'll be able to see your mom.
Oh!
You can't bring her back to life,
but now, you can go to her.
Ichigo
Mister
Thank you for everything
You ran around with me in your arms, so I didn't get hurt at all
Yes You're safe
Well, I'll be going, then. Thank you very much.
Yuichi
When I die and pass over...
would it be okay if I carried you and ran around again?
Yes!
Now, then Shall we get on with the Konso?
Thank youIchigo
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Pardon me for the last time.
I'm Kisuke Urahara, owner of the Urahara Store.
I'm going to do my best to bring you the preview this time.
The Urahara Store got its start when I
What are you talking about?!
I told you we don't have much time, didn't I?!
