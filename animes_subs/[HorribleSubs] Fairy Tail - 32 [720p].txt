Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
You killed Karen, your owner?
Spirits who kill their masters cannot return to the Spirit World.
I will now start to disappear.
In front of her grave...
But, that's...
It'll be all right! I'll yell it out countless times.
I believe your every tomorrow will be shining.
The intersection of all people
Never giving up. And that's why we're not gonna lose!
When it seems like you'll be blown away by the headwinds,
grasp this hand, try to take a chance.
Because you're not alone anymore, got it?
Go forward, more and more!
Don't give up on your awesome dream!
That's right, don't cry!
Move on, my way!
Now, with the light shining down upon you.
Don't even think about something like giving up!
Even if you trade being hurt again for strength.
Your eyes, always looking straight ahead,
can surely see the light!
It all started three years ago...
Sorry, I'm heading to the spa now.
You be good boys and run home now.
Hey, what about our date today?
What's with her?
She's got another harem?
Ugh.
Oh, Karen my dear, you're back?
If I must...
Gate of the Ram, I open thee!
Aries!
Um... Did you call me?
I'm sorry...
Oh-boy!
She's fluffy and cute!
There she is!
Aries!
Do me a favor and keep them company,'kay?
B-But, I...
I'm sorry!
Fine by me.
Let's play, fluffy-wuffy...
I'm not a spirit for entertaining men, though...
Are you disobeying my orders, huh?
I'm sorry!
Okay, then it's settled!
Let's play, Aries!
Let's go for a drive in my magic wheels!
The Spirit King!
Honestly, when a spirit starts talking back to her master...
What's the world coming to?
Karen, deary... Don't go treating your spirits so badly.
I'm free to use my property as I see fit, aren't I?
Little Aries seems like she's suffering.
Like when you used her as a shield to block the opposing wizard's attack...
I'm sorry!
Suffering? Spirits don't have feelings like that.
They're just tools.
Karen!
Spirits are living things, too!
Treat them poorly, and you'll be the one suffering next!
Don't bring your petty grievances to the master!
No! I didn't say a thing!
I'm sorry...
Making Master Bob angry at me is no laughing matter!
I-I didn't... I'm sorry...
Playing innocent, are you?
What are you going to do?
As punishment, I will have you stay in the human world for seven days.
Seven days? But you don't have that sort of magical power, Madame Karen.
I'm sorry!
I wouldn't underestimate me if I were you.
You'd do better to worry about yourself.
I wonder what'll happen to a Spirit that stays in the human world for seven days?
I'm curious...
P-Please stop...
I'm sorry.
Running away?
It's no use! I'll call you back as many times as it takes!
You're wrong. I forcibly switched places with her.
It's you...
Let it go, Karen.
Leo, the Lion.
That's how I was back then.
Aries and I were both bound by contract to Karen.
How dare you open the gate on your own!
I'm a spirit designed for battle and quite tough.
I can overlook a bit of mistreatment.
But if you continue to do such horrible things to Aries, I will not forgive you.
And what do you, a spirit, plan to do about it?
I think I should just tell you straight out today...
I want you to release Aries and me from our contracts.
What?
I cannot bear watching your evil actions.
The other spirits fear their keys coming into your possession.
Shut up! Silence!
You are a disgrace to Celestial Wizards.
Go back!
Gate of the Lion, close!
Close!
Close!
Go back, Leo!
Why can't I do a forced closure?
Until you release us from your contract, I have no intention of going back.
While I am here, you can't call any other spirits.
With your magical power, you aren't able to call more than one spirit at the same time after all.
That'll be quite a problem for you, yes?
I wonder if this will go as you plan?
Your magical power isn't infinite, either.
In ten days, my magical power will be used up, and you'll be forced to go back to the Spirit World.
No. I used my own magical power to come here.
Your magical power is irrelevant.
I'll stay here no matter how many days it takes.
There are some ruins to the west of town.
If you reconsider, come see me.
How dare he!
Come back, Leo!
Aren't you basically at your limit?
The Lion is the leader of the 12 Zodiac Gates.
Things that the other spirits can't handle, I can.
Until you release us from our contracts, I won't leave the human world.
You've got to be kidding me!
You expect me to give up two of the 12 Zodiac gate keys?
With you, I can earn a whole lot more money!
Go away.
When you feel like releasing us, come back.
Why, you...
Come on...
It's been a month already.
I can't do any work with you doing this!
I promise... I won't mistreat Aries any more.
Promise?
You're a liar.
If you really regret what you did, you'd let us free.
Damn you!
Go to hell and die!
If you disappear, I can call Aries again!
It's all'cause you're here!
This is all your fault, damn you!
I'm getting used to being in the Human World.
I can't really stop my life-force from eroding, but I'm not suffering like before.
It's been three months...
Maybe I should forgive Karen now.
If she mistreats Aries again, I can always save her once more.
It can't be!
She took on a job recklessly without my permission.
She must have been horribly impatient not being able to work for three months.
But Karen shouldn't have been able to call any spirits!
And yet...
A wizard using a large amount of magical power at once
should be able to call forth two spirits at the same time.
Karen was betting on that.
But in the end her body wasn't able to take it.
All I wanted was for Karen to rethink her actions...
To realize that spirits aren't tools...
That we have free will, that we have hearts of our own...
That's all I wanted...
This...
This isn't what I wanted!
Karen!
Karen!
That is the sin I committed.
Human life cannot be returned once it is lost.
The dead never return, for eternity.
The only way to repent is for me to disappear myself.
Loke, hey!
I guess it's about time...
Time? Time for what?
Time for me to disappear...
What are you talking about?
Karen...
Ever since that day, I've been unable to return to the Spirit World.
Y-Your hand...
It's the law of the Spirit World. The rules.
I can't do anything about it.
I was never able to forget about Karen since then.
I tried a lot of things to get my mind off it, but I could never forget.
I've simply been persisting until this time came.
Until the moment I disappear in front of Karen's grave.
And, at long last, the time has come.
Thank you, Lucy, for letting me meet a truly wonderful Celestial Wizard in the end...
Wait! I'll save you! Don't give up!
Give my regards to everyone at Fairy Tail...
No!
Lucy...
I won't accept this!
If you return to the Spirit World, your life-force will recover really quickly!
I'll make it so you can return!
You can't do that...
The law is the law...
But... This is wrong!
You didn't actually kill Karen!
It was just an unfortunate accident!
Lucy...
Gate of the Lion, I open thee!
Return Loke to the Spirit World!
Open! Please!
Open!
Lucy... That's enough. Please stop...
I won't stop!
I can't stand by when a friend of mine is disappearing before my eyes!
Gate of the Lion, I open thee!
Lucy! Don't use so much magical power all at once!
I said I'm going to save you, no matter what!
I can force open the gate to the Spirit World... Watch me!
Stop it!
Gate of the Lion, I open thee!
Open!
It won't open!
Spirits who let their contracted owner die can't go back to the Spirit World!
Please, stop!
You're starting to erode along with me!
At this rate you'll disappear when I do!
You won't die!
I won't let you die...
What's the point of magic to begin with if I can't use it protect my friends?
Stop it!
Don't make my crime any worse than it already is!
What crime?!
If that's the rule of the Spirit World, then I'll change it!
What's that?
It can't be...
That's the...
Why are you here?
The King? You mean the ruler of the Spirits?
Old friend.
It is forbidden for we who have compacted with humans to kill the one who possesses the key.
It matters not if it was direct or indirect.
Leo the Lion, you are no longer allowed to return to the Spirit World.
Hey, that's going too far!
Don't, Lucy!
Old friend... Human girl...
That law shall not be changed.
Wait, did he show himself because Lucy blurted out that she'd change the rule?
Just for that, the King came himself?
For three years... Loke's been suffering for three years!
For his friend! For Aries!
What else could he do?
I too am pained by my old friend's wish...
What are you talking about?
He's not your old friend!
He's your friend, right now, before your eyes!
Listen to me, Mustache Man!
Mustache?
L-Lucy...
This was an unfortunate accident.
Loke didn't do anything wrong!
I won't accept anything but his complete innocence!
I won't accept it!
Enough, Lucy...
I don't want anybody to forgive me...
I want to repent for my sins!
I just want to disappear!
You can't!
You disappearing isn't going to bring Karen back!
All it will do is create more sadness!
It's not a crime!
Caring about your friends is not a crime!
This many spirits... All at once...
Even Karen couldn't do this...
If you disappear, then Aries, myself, and everyone else here will be filled with sadness!
You won't be repenting for your sins at all that way!
Lucy!
All my friends came forward to show that they feel the same way.
Your friends?
If you're a spirit too, then you should know how Loke and Aries felt!
Lucy, why are you forcing yourself like this?
You want to follow in Karen's footsteps?
If my old friend goes so far as to say that...
Perhaps it is the law that is in error.
Leo, who committed the crime for his brethren Aries.
And you, old friend, who tried to save that Leo...
Considering the beauty of that bond, I will make an exception for this incident.
Leo, I give thee warrant to return to the Spirit World.
You ain't so bad, Mustache Man!
You are pardoned.
Be grateful to the star's guidance.
Wait, please...
If you still wish to repent for your sins, I order you to aid your friend and live on.
I believe her to be a friend of such worth.
You should protect her with your life.
You heard the man.
Lucy...
Yeah.
Thank you, Lucy...
A spirit?
You're a spirit, Loke?
Yup, that's the deal.
So that weird feeling when we switched places that time was from that!
Yup, that's what it was.
I didn't notice at all!
But wait... You're not a cow or a horse or nothin'.
You know Virgo, Natsu. She has a human form, remember?
Yeah, but she can turn into a gorilla.
Oh, yeah. That's true.
Loke's the Lion Spirit.
Lion?!
A grown-up cat!
That's right.
No, it's not!
Cool...
But are you feeling okay?
I'm not 100 yet, but I figured I'd come to say hi to everyone.
And I wanted to see Lucy again as soon as possible.
He lllikes you!
Stop rolling your tongue!
So let's talk, you and I, about the future!
Hey, now!
Man, I'm jealous.
I wish I had a spirit.
What kind of spirit?
A dragon, duh!
Then I could test out my Dragon Slayer magic for real!
Spirits aren't things you summon to test your strength!
That's right.
Spirits are for spinning tales of love...
You, go back already...
You're still not fully recovered, right?
Wait a second.
Here!
What are these?
Tickets for a resort hotel.
You guys really helped me out a lot.
Fish!
I've never stayed at a hotel as fancy as that!
I already gave Erza hers, so please have fun.
Hey, people!
What are you standing around for?
Want me to leave you behind?
Now that's fast!
Yeah, let's go!
I'll head off just like this!
Me, too!
Idiot, I have to pack for a trip a little, so hold up.
Lucy...
It's not like my sins have completely disappeared,
but you've given me the confidence now to move on.
Where once I was a member of Fairy Tail, now I am your spirit, Lucy.
I'll show up whenever my owner's in trouble.
Think of me as your prince on a white horse.
I'm not your owner.
I'm your friend, right?
That's right.
From now on, let's count on each other, Lucy.
Same to you, Loke!
Lucy, we're leaving.
So, Erza...
If...
If someone here was hurt or lost their life because of me, I think I'd suffer a lot like Loke.
But, it's okay.
Because if we all work together, we can overcome any trouble we might have, right?
You couldn't have said it better.
Yeah!
Hey, let's hurry and go!
Aye, sir!
Let's party all day and night, non-stop!
It's a favor from Loke, so we're going to have lots of fun!
Aye, sir!
There was no way I could have known that before long,
Erza's smile would disappear...
Hey, hey, Natsu!
I'm going to head out for a bit!
Upa!
Wow, you're really rarin' to go.
Where are you going?
Aye! I'm going to Heaven on earth!
What are you talking about?
Did you hit your head or something?
You'll know if you come with me.
What's with you? You're creepin' me out...
Next time: Tower of Heaven!
Huh? A fish restaurant?
This is my paradise!
Happy, don't leave me!
