I love you, Haru.
I-I can't believe I just said that...
Wh-What now?
I kind of got carried away by the moment...
What does Haru think?
Oh.
Heh...
Hmm...
I-I was lying.
Why are you blushing?
You're such a child.
He's acting mature?!
Uh...
So...
Wanna go out?
G-Go...?
N-No... I was lying.
Wait, you were seriously lying?
That's brutal.
Oh, well.
That makes me feel better.
I feel much, much better.
What?
What?!
Nuisance
Sorry, I can't keep him at my place.
We have a pet cat.
Oh, that would be dangerous.
The cat will eat the rooster.
Actually, my cat's too scared
to come down from the dresser now.
You brought it back, Yoshida-kun!
You never stop, Saeko.
Hey, can we keep him at school?
We had chicken coops at my grade school and middle school.
I think we had one at our middle school.
Really?
I never noticed anything.
So Sensei, can you ask for permission?
What?!
No way!
You kids have no idea how much of a pain those geezers are!
They gave permission...
Hooray! Hooray!
What? What?
Why?
A-Anyway! You better take good care of it, Yoshida-kun!
I'm counting on you, Mizutani-san!
I knew it...
Don't worry. I'll help.
I can lend a hand,
since it's kind of my fault.
You're a nice person, Sasahara-kun.
You can call me Sasayan.
Sasayan-kun.
Library
Okay...
That should cover everything.
We just need to figure out what
Kick-off Meeting Name: Nagoya Clothing: Feathers Food: Chicken feed Shelter: Chicken coop
we're doing about the chicken coop.
Mizutani Shizuku-san,
please participate.
Gulp.
How do you build a chicken coop?
Oh, I can look that up.
You can find anything on the Internet.
There's a hardware store near my home.
I could go buy the materials.
L-Let's go together!
We can all go over the weekend!
The School Rooster Committee Kick-off Meeting Name: Nagoya Clothing: Feathers Food: Chicken feed Shelter: Chicken coop
Sure, I guess...
Mind if we go after my practice?
Spending the weekend with classmates...
That's perfectly okay!
Now that that's set,
it's time for the next step!
Next step?
Choosing a meeting place!
You know, a location and time!
So...
Wanna go out?
N-No... I was lying.
I feel much, much better.
Should I have accepted?
But that was a spur-of-the-moment confession on my part.
What's wrong with me?
In any case, it's clear that
he wasn't happy about my feelings.
Misawa Batting Center
Ah.
You're early.
Oh, yeah.
We got out of practice early.
W-Want to wait inside?
Sure.
Right, I don't like being alone with boys.
Huh?
And don't come back.
Did you see that?
He was pretty handsome.
Yo.
'Sup, baseballer.
Huh? Do you know him, Sasahara-kun?
Yep, I come here all the time.
What? Are you also one of Haru's friends?
We're in the same class.
I'll go take a few swings.
Sure.
Hmm? What is it?
You shouldn't lend strange people money.
Huh?
Yo, Natsume.
You're supposed to hold the bat like this.
Huh? What?
S-Sorry!
My brother broke my alarm clock...
Granny clothes.
Hardware
Absolutely not!
Why not?!
It's so cool!
There isn't enough money in the federal budget!
Borrow money! Take out a mortgage!
No! Roosters can't find work!
I've had enough.
Let's leave them here and go look for materials.
Sounds good.
Gold... Gold... Gold...
Brown... Black...
Excuse me.
Hey! Aren't you...
I-It's them!
Perfect timing.
We need to talk to you.
Mizutani-san, how big should the...
Sasayan-kun.
A-Am I interrupting something?
Who's the twerp?
What do you jerks think you're doing?!
Run, Mizutani-san!
That was scary.
I thought you were going to fight them.
That's crazy talk.
I've never been in a fight in my life.
Let's get out of this place.
Hey! Wait up!
Whoa, you're so slow!
Yoshida!
Behind you!
Mizutani-san's in trouble!
Haru!
Hey, Haru! Wait!
No way...
Oh, it's you guys.
Crap.
Just run, Haru!
You're so slow, Shizuku.
Uh-huh, yeah.
Sorry, but can you buy what we need, Natsume-san?
They might still be around.
Thanks.
I'll go help her carry everything.
Yoshida, look after Mizutani-san.
Sure.
Drink this.
Thanks.
Are you okay?
Yeah...
The surprises never end with you.
You sent him flying with one arm...
What am I supposed to say to the guy I just rejected?
You're acting weird.
Huh?
Normally, you would refuse to look after the rooster.
You would refuse to go out over the weekend.
It's weird.
Did something happen?
He's right...
This guy is weirdly perceptive.
Nothing happened.
Don't lie to me.
I-I'm not lying.
Are you sure?
If you say so.
They're taking forever.
Was he worried about me?
Hey!
We bring goodies!
Misawa Batting Center
Parking Lot
Cutting wood is a pain in the ass.
I told you to ask the store to cut it for us.
It doesn't seem realistic for the four of us
to build this coop by ourselves.
I went with the simplest instructions I could find...
I told you we should have bought that cool one.
Oh? What's this?
You're already giving up?
Sawing wood?
That's grueling work.
Oh, I have a chainsaw you can use.
Why didn't you mention that sooner?!
Man... I'll go grab it.
Then I'll go buy ice cream.
What do you want?
Get me a soda flavored Garigari-kun popsicle.
I'll have a Choco Monaca Jumbo.
You've got it!
Are we going to finish this today?
Found ya.
Whoa, they're back.
Don't be too hasty.
We want to talk.
Anyway, we kinda feel bad,
but he's been ignoring us.
Oh.
Why don't you apologize then?
Right, Mizutani-san?
I think it's selfish to expect him to listen after you hurt his feelings,
As long as you don't interfere with our work.
This girl is cold...
Can't you see that we're asking you to help us out?
Not my problem.
Oh, I see how it is.
You're in love with Haru.
Wow, for real?
I-I'm not!
Oh, really?
I said that I'm not!
Hey! It's you guys!
Haru!
Now, now. Calm down, Haru.
I'm outta here!
We're only here to talk.
Right, Mizutani-san?
Don't touch Shizuku.
That hurt! Listen to me!
Get that dirty look off your face, Yamaken.
You're always resorting to violence like a little brat!
So, why are they here?
Don't touch her like that.
Beats me...
Oh...
Hey, Haru.
They want to make peace.
As proof,
they're going to help us build the chicken coop.
What?! That's bullshit!
Why would we waste our time on that?!
If you want to make peace,
you need to show that you mean it.
Make peace.
She's right.
Oh, I see.
You should have said something sooner.
That's great. Come join us.
Too easy...
I-I've seen this happen on TV before!
We're going to become friends now, right?
Hey, you're actually attracted to this?
You're in love with this?
You guys aren't so bad.
I bought ice cream!
I got sidetracked, so it's a little melted.
There's more people!
Whoa! She's super cute!
Next, assemble these.
You're right. She's super cute!
Hey, don't let go!
M-Mitty...
What's your name?
Who are these people?
I can build something without doing any work myself...
Beautiful.
What?!
Nagoya
And so, we were able to complete the chicken coop.
It's not cute!
It's so cool...
Yeah, we did a good job.
I brought Nagoya.
He went inside!
Ain't it great?
Congrats, Mizutani-san.
You didn't do any work.
Why would I?
I told you not to touch her.
That hurt!
Cut it out!
You ticked me off.
I can't wait to take it to school next week.
Yeah.
I have a feeling we're going to get yelled at.
Just put it in a grassy spot and it'll be fine.
Your friends are a little scary,
but they're nice people.
Oh...
Yeah.
Hmm? Why did he look at me?
I'm going this direction.
Ditto.
I'll walk with you.
See you on Monday!
Good job, everyone.
Bye.
By the way, why did you name him Nagoya?
Now you ask?
Nagoya Cochin chickens are famous.
This is far enough, Haru.
Don't be shy.
Huh?
I want to stay with you a little longer.
There he goes again...
What now?
I can't bring myself to look up at him.
Did you know?
God decides when people get to be lucky or unlucky
so everything balances out in the end.
It nets to zero?
Well, I don't believe any of that.
It's a bunch of smoke and mirrors.
Still, I've been thinking lately.
If meeting you was my lucky moment,
it balances out everything else that's happened.
Only good things have happened
since I met you.
I give up!
You win!
I love you, Haru.
It's impossible to guess how someone else feels.
In that case, I should let it all out.
You said that you felt much better
after I said that I didn't love you.
You meant what you said, right?
I understand that you don't want my affection,
but I've fallen in love with you.
What am I supposed to do?
You're pretty blunt.
Only because you keep playing dumb.
Sorry.
It's not that I don't want your affection.
I love you, too.
I've had some dirty thoughts about you.
I didn't need to know that.
But my love is probably different from yours.
I thought you would leave me if you realized that.
I was scared.
I see.
In that case, let's start all over.
I'll wait for you to fall in love with me before I say it again.
Yes, this is right.
The answer was very simple.
Well, we should go home, Haru.
Y-Yeah...
After all, Haru said that he wants to be with me.
That's all I need right now.
Mi-chan Yuzan's on his way
Shizuku, don't go home yet.
Let's find a place to spend the night.
My simple answer
was immediately shot down.
What?
What?!
Seriously...
He's so much trouble!
I'm home.
I'm Yoshida. Thanks for having me.
Nice to meet you, Pops.
Uh, Shizuku-san? This is...
He doesn't want to go home tonight.
What?! What's that supposed to mean?
Takaya, have you eaten dinner?
Yes.
Nice place you got here.
N-No, it's just a normal house...
Isn't your mom around?
She's working.
You can stay in the guest room...
Let's find a place to spend the night.
For a moment there, I was picturing something else.
Here.
What's this?
It's just fried rice.
Did you make this?!
Weren't you watching me?
There's also pickled vegetables.
You're amazing!
Like one of those countryside grandmas!
Thanks.
Man...
I told you not to come back here.
Are you listening to me, Yuzan?
Hey, there's a spirit in this house.
H-How can you walk around my house naked like that?!
Wait, you study at home, too?
Wh-What do I do?
I can't look at him...
I'm bored. Let's play a word game.
No, thanks!
Actually, Dad always walks around in his underwear.
I-Is this normal?
I-I guess I could sneak a peek...
Use the futon if you're going to sleep.
Where is he?
He's not coming home tonight.
What?!
Sweet
But I brought him a present!
Whatever. Make me some tea, Mitsuyoshi.
Yeah, yeah.
Haru's such a coward.
He can't run away forever.
He was acting a little strange,
but maybe it was my imagination.
Oh, why were you guys in the spray paint section?
Duh.
For graffiti, of course!
It's a crime to deface public property.
It's not against the law to spray the statues in my own home.
His yard is full of sculptures!
Why do punks like to draw on walls?
Because the wall's asking to be drawn on!
And because walls are a big draw for punks!
My point is...
Hmm?
Yard is full of sculptures...
He's rich and an art buff?!
Hey, don't be too...
Do you want to know why I named you Nagoya?
It's because...
No, forget it.
Something happened with Nagoya Cochin in my past...
No, I can't tell you.
It's a secret.

Sorry! I can't tell you!
Cut me some slack!
