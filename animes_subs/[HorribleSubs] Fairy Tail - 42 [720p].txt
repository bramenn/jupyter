Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Miss, that's dangerous!
Phew, that was close...
I haven't been able to find any decent jobs.
What am I going to do about this month's rent?
It'll work out somehow?
I never realized you had such a positive outlook, Plue.
No one's here...
And why exactly do I get so tense every time I come home?
Yeah, I have been through a lot.
Anyway, time for a bath!
It's like I'm back from the dead!
Hey, who're you callin' dead?!
Comedy doesn't work so well when I'm doing both parts...
Wow, you actually do wilt if you get soaked in hot water.
How cute!
Battle of Fairy Tail!
Good night!
Somethin' seems familiar here...
Good morning, Lucy.
One: I'm over here!
Two: This is my house!
Three: That is my bed!
Aye...
Get out!
Nope, not happenin'...
Is he even listening?
Give Natsu back his scarf...
Now that you mention it, I never see him without it, do I?
He said that he got it from Igneel.
Hey, is Natsu really okay?
Yeah.
This is a side effect from when he ate Etherion.
Oh, it is?
Aye. He got this way before when he ate Laxus's lightning once.
I guess eating magic other than fire isn't any good for him.
And wait, why did he eat Laxus's lightning?
Natsu challenged him in the past.
Although he was wiped out instantly, of course.
Laxus is seriously that powerful?
Aye! He's really majorly strong.
Although there's Erza and Mystogan too...
Mira used to be really dangerous herself.
She was called the Demon.
Mira-san was what?
I wonder who would win if Fairy Tail held a contest to see who was the strongest?
I don't want us fellow wizards to be ranked like that.
There's also Gray and Elfman...
Gajeel and Juvia are obviously strong too...
Sure, whatever.
Everyone's awesome...
Anyway, see you tomorrow!
Aye...
What's this?
I was thinking about giving it to you.
You need the money, right?
Fairy Tail is participating in the Harvest Festival.
Look at the bottom right.
Miss Fairy Tail Contest?
Aye!
The prize for winning is 500,000 jewel!
500,000?
That's seven month's worth of rent! And it's perfect for me!
Mira and Cana are participating, but I don't think you'd lose, Lucy.
Mira-san, too?
She used to do photo spreads for the Weekly Sorcerer...
But I'm younger!
So with my fresh new charm...
I can do this!
I can get that 500,000!
I'm gonna win this thing! Oh, yeah!
Didn't you say something about not wanting your fellow wizards ranked like that?
Happy, would you like a yummy fish?
Natsu... So this is what they call human ego...
This is the town of Shirotsume.
The Dark Guild, Ghoul Spirit is to the north-west.
You laughed at us?
You came for a beating, you punks!
Don't let them leave here alive!
Honestly, what does a guild like yours that sneaks among the shadows
think they are doing making fun of an official guild...
What happened?
They turned to stone?
Get'em!
Go now, my babies!
That's enough, Bickslow.
What? That's it?
How dare they form a guild, as weak as they are.
My babies ain't had enough fun yet!
More!
More!
Then I've got something perfect for you...
Oh, you mean what Laxus was talking about?
He's finally going to do it.
I've been waiting for this moment forever!
So have my babies!
Just three of them completely wiped us... wiped Ghoul Spirit out!
That's Fairy Tail's Raijin Tribe... Laxus's personal guard!
My Raijin Tribe is coming back.
Finally, my moment has come.
Time for the Fairies to destroy each other.
Old man, your time is over!
The whole city is focused on the Harvest Festival...
Everyone said they're busy preparing for the Fantasia.
Yes, since this is Fairy Tail's grand parade that's the pride of the entire continent!
It'd be nice if Laxus would participate.
Enough about him.
I heard from Levy that he's returned to town.
He's what?
Master...
He had to come back now, of all times...
Gramps, Gramps!
Gramps!
Oh, Laxus!
Aren't you going to join the Fantasia?
I promised to watch it with you, remember?
Yay, yay!
I hope I can join Fairy Tail soon!
Not so fast there, kiddo!
I-I can't see!
No kidding...
How'bout that, Laxus?
Those are Fairy Tail wizards!
Wow!
Wow, Gramps!
You're the best guild master ever!
When I grow up, I want to join Fairy Tail!
I see, I see!
And then, the day of the Harvest Festival...
It's a festival!
Aye!
Time to chow down!
Gotta eat'em all!
Let's eat!
He still doesn't seem so well.
Is he okay?
Just leave him be...
You never change, do you?
Warren!
How long has it been?
I made it back for the Harvest Festival, somehow.
You take on too many jobs at once, man!
Wow!
I'm the new recruit, Juvia.
Oh, I've heard about you.
Warren Rocko.
He has telepathic abilities.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you as well.
But...
What a lot of people!
People have come from all over to see the Fantasia.
I want to see it too!
You're participating in it, remember?
Oh, yeah! That reminds me...
The Miss Fairy Tail Contest is starting!
My rent!
Juvia cannot allow herself to lose to Lucy-san.
You're going to participate too?
Everyone, I'm so glad you could make it!
The battle of beauty between our female Fairies...
Let's start the Miss Fairy Tail Contest!
I am Max, the sand wizard, and I will be your host!
You don't care about this stuff, right?
I'm a Man!
The exotic beauty with a bottomless pit for a stomach,
Cana Alberona!
Now it's time to appeal to the audience with your magic!
The cards are hiding Cana's body...
She changed into a swimsuit!
I'll take that beer-money, thanks.
A swimsuit?
No fair!
I see...
That's a good idea.
You're participating too, Erza?
When I hear there's a contest, I can't help but get motivated.
My rent is slipping away from me...
She might be a newcomer, but her abilities are S class!
Rain or shine, this woman will steal your heart!
Juvia Lockser!
May these feelings reach you, Gray-sama!
She put on a performance that matches her swimsuit!
Gray-sama, did you see?
Another one going for sex appeal?!
Everyone's favorite poster girl of the guild...
Her beauty is known throughout the land!
Mirajane!
We've been waiting!
We have a winner!
It's really her!
She's cuter in person!
Now, appeal to the audience!
My specialty is transformation magic, so I'll transform!
Head-only Happy! Aye!
Head-only Gajeel-kun!
You're the only one happy about this, you know.
Neechan...
The crowd favorite just shot herself in the foot.
She needs no explanation... Titania!
That's my cue!
Erza Scarlet!
She's here!
Erza, you're so cool!
Fairy Tail's strongest woman!
She's really popular!
I will show you all a very special requip.
G-Goth Loli?
That decided it.
That's really different of her.
Oui...
Entry number five!
The little fairy with cutes and intelligence...
Levy McGarden!
Levy!
Solid Script!
Levy!
The sexy sniper Bisca Moulin!
Requip!
The Gunner!
Yeehaw!
How cute!
Everyone's really amazing...
Our guild's super rookie!
That's me!
This upcoming star will sparkle with the guidance of Celestial Spirits!
Lucy Heart-
Don't say my last name!
What's this?
She's cute...
If they found out who my dad is, they'll never award me the 500,000!
Now, appeal to the audience!
Um, I'm going to do a cheer dance routine with my Spirits!
Hey! I'm not done appealing yet!
If you want a Fairy, then you want me.
If you want beauty, then you want me.
Yes, I am all you want!
The winner is obviously me, Evergreen!
Okay! The idiotic contest is now over!
Evergreen?
She's back?
Hey, don't get in my way!
My rent is counting on this, you know!
Lucy, don't look into her eyes!
What's with this kid?
What's this?
She's turned to stone!
Is this supposed to be appealing?
This is bad...
Everyone, quickly escape!
What are you doing, Evergreen?
Do you plan on ruining the festival?
You need some entertainment for a festival, yes?
Neechan!
Even Erza!
You fool!
Return them to normal at once!
Hey, you Fairy Fails!
This festival's just getting started!
Laxus?
Freed?
Bickslow?
The Raijin Tribe...
Laxus's personal guard!
Let's play, old man.
Enough of this foolishness!
Return them to normal at once!
I wonder how many will be left to be in the Fantasia?
Don't!
These women are my hostages.
If you break the rules, I'll shatter them, one by one.
I told you, remember?
This is entertainment!
This isn't funny, Laxus!
I'm being serious.
Let's just see who the strongest is in Fairy Tail.
Time for fun!
Fun, fun!
The rules are simple!
That last one standing is the winner!
Battle of Fairy Tail!
I like it! Simple!
I'm getting fired up!
I like that eager spirit of yours.
Natsu!
It's a festival, Gramps.
Let's do this.
Don't you remember when you got beat by Laxus before?
I was just a kid!
It was last year!
I was a kid last year.
But I hate that you have no sense of flair.
So cool down.
Natsu!
See what I said?
What a Man...
Aww, and he had just recovered...
If you want these girls returned to normal, you must defeat us!
There are 4 of us, and around 100 of you, right?
100 on 4!
You have 3 hours.
After that, they turn to dust, I'm afraid.
The field of battle is the entirety of Magnolia.
When you find us, the battle begins.
Laxus...
Stop this foolishness!
Now, now! I said to cool down!
It's entertainment for the festival, see?
Let's have fun!
Battle of Fairy Tail... Begin!
H-He disappeared!
So we have to play tag in Magnolia?
Damn it!
We have to save my sister and the others!
Get Laxus!
Bisca, I'll save you. Just you wait.
That fool...
I'll... I'll stop you!
Gramps!
An invisible wall?
Don't be silly!
There's nothing there!
What's going on?
What's this?
There are characters floating in the air...
Freed's runes?
Runes?
A type of barrier.
Anyone who steps in its boundary is bound by the rules.
If you don't obey them, you can't get out.
Establishment Magic!
What's written?
Those older than 80 or stone statues may not pass.
A magic where the guy who sets the rules wins?
It takes a long time to write the runes.
It is not suited for a sudden battle,
but when it comes to setting traps, there's nothing better.
Can't you break it down, Gramps?
The rune's rules are absolute!
Man, they planned for everything.
So I guess we'll have to handle it ourselves.
Gray...
I don't care if he's your grandson or whatever, I ain't holdin' back.
I'll get Laxus.
Is there anyone who could beat Laxus?
Erza might be able to...
But in her condition...
Who's there?
Reedus?
I-I'm scared of Laxus...
Fine, fine...
Instead, I'd like you to pay a visit to Poluchka in the East Forest.
Oui?
She might have some potion that'll cure petrification.
Oui.
You're awake!
Huh?
Where's Laxus?
And wait, everyone's gone!
If Natsu really got serious, then perhaps...
Gramps, where did everyone go?
Should I count on his latent ability?
Natsu!
The festival has started!
Laxus is somewhere within Magnolia!
Get out there and beat'im!
All right!
Just you wait, Laxus!
Why?
Find them, Alzack?
They aren't here.
How about you?
No, not a clue.
Damn it!
How dare they do that to Bisca!
Hey, calm down Alzack!
How can I be calm at a time like this?
We only have three hours!
What's this?
Shoot!
Runes?
So there are rune traps around the city?
This must be Freed's work!
Only the strongest wizard is allowed to exit these runes?
He's trying to make us fight each other?
That's cruel, Freed!
Sorry...
What's going on here?
Natsu! Are you 80 years old?
Are you a stone statue?
As if!
Current Status Report.
Jet vs. Droy vs. Alzack?
W-What's this?
Why are they fighting each other?
Falcon Heaven's Soar!
Knuckle Plant!
Guns Magic!
Tornado Shot!
Winner: Alzack.
Jet and Droy: Out of action.
What?
Damn... I'm sorry.
I wonder how long you can stand to see the Fairies destroying each other, old man...
The hell with this, Laxus!
That time we laughed, saying we're both like each other,
we even kindly overlooked the little lies.
If we lose a place to go back to together, I don't care.
Because I'll protect that smile.
The meetings and partings numerous as the stars in the sky...
All the things I don't want to lose...
Right now I feel like I don't need any of them.
I just want to see you by my side,
all my happiness and sadness.
Let's start from here.
Let's start our tomorrow.
Let's do it like we've just been reborn.
Like flowers blown in a summer wind,
let us bloom brightly in this instant.
It's finally time for the Raijin Tribe to enter the fight!
Evergreen, Bickslow, Freed...
Those guys are crazy strong, you know!
I'm gettin' fired up!
Natsu, sorry to kill your excitement,
but unless you can get out of the barrier, you can't join in.
Oh, right...
Next time: Defeat your Friends to Save your Friends!
Now that you mention it, Gajeel doesn't seem to be able to exit the barrier either.
Why don't you get to know each other better over a cup of tea?
Tea with him? No way!
