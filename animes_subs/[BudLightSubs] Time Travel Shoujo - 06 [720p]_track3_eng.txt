I put on the armillary compass I found in the laboratory basement,
which sent me back to 19th century London with Mari.
You've got to be kidding me!
This is the worst possible time, when I'm still fighting with Futa!
There, we met the scientist, Mr. Faraday.
And then he used his electromagnetic... um... rotation device...
for an experiment that proved a relationship between electricity and magnetism.
But Mr. Farraday's patron, Sir Davy, said this about his results...
These experimental results and your thesis are both stolen from our research!
Wait, sir!
Things were looking real bad, but...
Sir...
Something happened, so I couldn't even worry about that!
Where's Mari?
Episode 6 Faraday's Resolve
No... I don't like this...
I can't go home... I can't go home!
Go on, drink this. It'll warm you up.
As I understand it, when Mari would go back into the past,
she would return naturally after a certain amount of time had passed.
You came here this time under the same circumstances.
Yet Mari returned to her own time without you. Right?
Waka?
Hey, it's okay. When a scientific experiment fails,
or presents a phenomenon you've never seen before,
there's always a reason for it.
If we can figure out a reason...
Shut up!
What would you understand? Science is all you talk about.
Look at the situation your science has put me in!
I can't take this!
Let me go home! Send me home!
Waka! Calm down!
Let me go home!
It's no use. I can't find a single clue about how to bring Waka back.
Shun! Awful news!
What's wrong?
She's panicking...
I'm sorry...
Mari...
If I had only told her the way to get back...
I'm sure we'll find a way.
Waka...
Breach of contract? My husband?
Yes. I can't tell you all the details,
but Dr. Hayase may have committed a severe breach
of the contract he signed with me.
Therefore, I want his laboratory opened
and a full delivery of all his research materials to me.
His research materials?
What kind of contract did he sign?
There's no need for you to know that.
Just be quiet and comply with our request.
Request? This sounds more like a threat.
We don't mind taking this to the authorities.
Take it anywhere you want!
What was that?
Then I'll be able to have a good look at the contract. I'll go through the whole thing.
Now, please leave.
I'm losing all my customers because of you.
This is obstruction of my business.
I apologize. We'll return later.
As apology for sending your customers away, I'll buy a few things.
From here...
No, thank you! I don't accept such random purchases!
I work hard to make those for people who love cake!
The layering in these mille-feuilles was done with great care.
I can tell just from looking how much time it took you.
This gateau chocolat
has a hint of chocolat mon amour from Dolce de Michelle in France, right?
They're very good cakes.
Thank you for your patronage.
Mr. Mikage... Are you sure about this?
She's a smart person.
Good morning!
Good morning! Have a good sleep?
Um... I...
I'm sorry to make a lady sleep on the sofa,
but it was all I had.
I see.
I got tired from all the crying and fell asleep.
Hold on. I can make breakfast.
Um...
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Don't sweat it!
Go on, wash up.
It wasn't just a nightmare...
Waka! It's done!
Wow! It looks delicious!
You haven't eaten since yesterday! It's only natural.
Go on!
Th-Thanks.
First, eat a good meal.
You can worry about the rest after that.
Sure... Let's eat!
Delicious!
I'm glad.
I believe...
My brother's still back in my time.
Your brother?
Yes.
He's really smart and reliable.
Mari, too. She can be a scatterbrain,
but she really comes through when it counts.
Anyway, I trust them both.
I'm sure they'll find a way to help me.
I see!
I wonder how long it's been there...
I guess there's no way to get Waka back...
Waka must be feeling so lonely...
What's wrong?
I remember! Papa told me!
And when you get back,
tell Shun to press the triangle button in the middle of the keyboard.
The triangle button?
Yeah! He said it would teach you the system controls!
In the center?
This one?
Probably!
I was being careful not to touch things
when someone was in the past, so as not to cause any trouble, but...
Would you like more tea?
Yes, please!
Faraday! Awful news!
What's wrong?
Sir Davy's been going around everywhere since last night,
telling everyone you stole his and Dr. Wollaston's research!
What?
I guess he didn't like that his apprentice got results when he didn't.
Of course, we don't believe you'd do something like that.
But it's been the talk of the society all morning.
It's just a rumor... but it's possible he may oppose your membership
in the Royal Institution.
Sir Davy has a lot of influence with the Institution.
Yeah... And some people might use this to curry favor with him.
Oh, no...
Wait, please! Sir Davy!
I swear, I didn't steal your research!
I got those results from my own experiment!
I will firmly denounce you
as a shameless fraud who stole his patron's research.
Sir...
At this rate, you may be left unable to take part in scientific study anywhere.
He wants to take science away from me?
Is that it?
Wait!
Please, wait!
W-Wait!
Please...
You were Faraday's...
His friend.
Please! Don't take science from him!
Did you come running after me to say that?
Pathetic.
He really does love science!
To take that from him... It's going too far.
He's getting what's coming to him.
You're a scientist too, aren't you?
Then... you know how painful it would be to lose your scientific work, right?
Do not compare me to Faraday!
He can't even do math!
He hasn't had a day's proper education!
He can't do anything
except for running experiments over and over!
What's wrong with that?
What?
Getting results through constant experiments.
That's how he does science.
That's how he does the science he loves!
Losing yourself in something...
Losing yourself in just one thing... What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with losing yourself in what you love?
I'm back.
Mr. Faraday!
Where did he go?
How's it going, Shun?
Well, it says synchronization rate is 100...
Brother? Mari?
Is that you, Mari? Can you hear me? Hey!
Waka!
I can hear you!
Hey, what's going on?
It's not on fast-forward anymore!
I see! The armillary compass and the system have synchronized!
I'm so glad!
Waka! Listen close!
You know the knob at the bottom of the compass?
Knob?
This?
Yeah, that!
If you turn that, you can come back here!
Really?
Yeah!
That's how I got back from Mr. Volta's time!
Thank goodness!
I thought I'd never make it home!
Now, now. Don't cry!
Waka, come back.
Okay!
What's wrong?
Hey... What's going to happen with Mr. Faraday's discoveries and research?
To put it simply, his discovery will be the basis
for the invention of the modern-day motor.
Motor?
Then cars and washing machines and stuff...
We owe them all to Mr. Faraday?
Yes. His influence won't stop at the scientific world.
In a way, he's the man who laid the foundation for all modern culture.
Waka?
Is it okay... if I stay here a little bit longer?
Where are you, Mr. Faraday?
Mr. Faraday!
I've been searching everywhere!
Are you going to quit...
You can't quit. You can't!
What you're doing now will lead to some very important inventions in the future.
In the future?
It's called a motor.
You invent that, and it improves everybody's lives.
Motors have an incredible power... the power to move things!
Waka...
You believe that science exists to make people happy, right?
You love science, right?
Then you can't stop!
Come on now, Waka. Who said I was going to give up on science?
What? But... you'd cleaned up all your things...
And you were here, staring off into the distance... so...
No, no!
I came up with a new experiment,
so I cleared off my desk to make space for it!
Then why didn't you tell me that earlier?!
Sorry! Anyway, let's get started!
If running electricity through the copper wire
can cause a magnet to rotate,
then thinking backwards from there,
you should be able to generate electricity using copper wire and magnets, too.
Anything?
No reaction.
Let's run some electricity through it, to make sure the galvanometer is working.
Working normally.
Okay, let's try it again!
No reaction.
Let's change the direction of the magnet.
What now?
Nothing.
What about now?
No reaction.
No use, huh?
It seems theoretically possible, but...
But not getting any result in an experiment makes it a failure, right?
A failure? That's no big deal!
That means I get to try an all-new experiment!
What should I change for the next experiment?
What result will come from it?
Just thinking about it gets me excited!
No matter how many times I fail, no matter how hard it is,
I could never hate science!
Mr. Faraday...
So I'll never quit science, either.
Never!
I see.
Then I'll be going home.
Huh?
I see!
You found a way to get back, right?
Yeah!
Goodbye... Mr. Faraday.
Say hello to Mari. And your brother, too.
Okay!
Good luck!
Thank you, Waka.
Waka!
Mari!
I'm so glad! I'm so glad!
So, so glad!
Thanks...
Brother...
I'm sorry I worried you.
Did you do what you had to?
Yeah!
After conducting the electromagnetic rotation experiment in 1821,
Faraday continued exploring the relationship between magnetism and electricity
until 1831, when an experiment led him to discover the Law of Induction,
which would later be known as Faraday's Law.
The faster the lines of magnetic force change,
and the more coils in the circuit,
the greater their induced current becomes.
That law became indispensable in later thinking about generating electricity,
and became the cornerstone of the study of electromagnetism.
Huh? This book...
Brother!
What's this?
What's wrong?
It didn't disappear.
Huh?
Morse. Bell.
No way!
Hertz. Edison.
Is it because we're in control of the machine?
Or because our power source has switched from a battery to a standard outlet?
I will not acknowledge it. I won't!
I will not acknowledge Faraday's assertion!
I'd advise you to stop, Sir Davy.
Is there something else you want?
Faraday will make enormous contributions to the scientific world in the future.
And, Sir Davy,
your greatest contribution will be discovering him.
You realize that, don't you?
Intermediate English Problems by Level
What are you doing?
Wh-What do you want?
This isn't for club! I'm just taking a break!
I'm studying properly, I tell you!
It's upside-down.
You won't accomplish anything by doing such a half-baked job on everything.
What?
Next week is your match, right?
I got them to give you permission to practice.
Huh?
But you have to get 80 or more on the next test.
That's the condition.
Where did this come from?
After practice, I'll teach you.
So get going, okay?
Futa.
What?
You're really good at soccer.
And... you love it.
So... you should aim for the top... or something.
Huh?
Well, you know...
I'm telling you to work hard at soccer!
You know I will!
I'm going to the World Cup, no matter what!
And if I need it to get there...
I know you'll make it, Futa.
Yeah!
Thanks, Mizuki.
Mr. Mikage.
You have a call from Mr. Sekota, the research assistant you met with before.
Understood.
Yes? Mikage speaking.
You remembered something?
A book?
Magnets and Electricity...
Next Episode: Morse's Inspiration Magnets and Electricity...
Mari and Waka's Quick Science
Mari and Waka's Quick Science! Mari and Waka's Quick Science
What was Mr. Faraday trying to accomplish?
Last time, he learned that changes in current and magnetic field produce power, remember?
Yeah.
He was testing the opposite of that.
That the movement of a magnet could generate electric current.
But it didn't work...
Later, he learned that by coiling copper wire and running a magnet through it...
It worked!
Let's test it!
Wrap a coil around an acrylic tube,
pass a magnet through, and...
The needle moved!
Structure of a Generator
The truth is, when the magnet gets close to the coil, Structure of a Generator
it changes the magnetic field inside the coil and causes electricity to flow. Structure of a Generator
This principle became the basis for the generator. Structure of a Generator
This principle became the basis for the generator.
When we rotate the handle of this hand-cranked generator, attached to an LED...
So bright!
It turned on!
Electric Current Power Magnetic Field It turned on!
Electric Current Power Magnetic Field There's a coil and a magnet inside the generator.
Electric Current Power Magnetic Field Huh? That looks like a motor.
Huh? That looks like a motor.
Now, when we swap the LED for a battery...
The handle turned!
Which means the system is the same, but the principle is reversed?
That's right!
Faraday invented the basic principle behind the motor,
and from there, he arrived at the principle behind the generator.
Thinking backwards really can advance science, huh?
