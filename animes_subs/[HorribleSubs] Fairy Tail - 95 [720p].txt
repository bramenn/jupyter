This is Earthland, in the outskirts of Magnolia.
We're back!
Everything's back to normal!
The city of Magnolia is, too!
Yippee!
Wait.
It's too early to rejoice.
We need to make sure everyone is safe, first.
Everyone's fine!
We got to Earthland a bit before you, see.
We've already flown around a bunch!
The people in the guild and the city are all safe!
It seems like none of them even realize they were turned into a lacrima!
Earthland sure is amazing!
There's magic everywhere!
What's going on?
Why... Why are the Exceeds in Earthland?
Lisanna.
This is no joke.
They're dangerous!
We should return them to Edolas.
Come on, now...
Extalia's gone, remember?
Forgive them, will you?
No.
I'm sorry I threw stones at you.
I'm sorry!
But, we don't have any place to return to.
We'll change our ways!
Please, forgive us!
Who cares about that?
You sent me to Earthland with orders to eliminate the Dragon Slayers!
That's right!
The Queen stole our eggs!
I ain't ever gonna forget that, no way!
Dear...
Hey, Mister!
But even if you tell us to go back...
We never really explained carefully, did we?
This story goes back 6 years ago.
I believe we've mentioned how the Queen, Chagot,
has the power to see the future, yes?
One day...
Extalia is falling!
If the Queen saw such a vision, there can be no mistake...
Such violence... The only ones who could do such a thing...
It must be the humans!
Thinking back on it now,
it was probably the drying up of magic power that would cause the islands to fall naturally...
However, at the time, we thought the cause would surely be the humans.
What shall we do?
We would not win a war against the humans.
We'll evacuate the children...
Evacuate?!
Then, that means...
Huh? That's not exactly... what you told us before...
Indeed.
This plan was kept secret even from the citizens of Extalia.
And the Queen lied... She put on an act.
This is a plan to destroy monsters from another world... The Dragon Slayers!
Please, I wish for everyone to trust me.
Having the Queen lie like that pained my heart so...
We had no other choice.
How could we say publicly that Extalia would crash into the ground?
And of course, we had no particular grudge against Dragon Slayers.
We know!
You needed to create a convincing story, right?
Plus, if you told the truth I'm sure everyone would panic.
No kidding.
We borrowed the human's Anima, and our plan was a success.
But...
There was just one thing that happened we didn't account for...
It was... your power, Carla.
You have a similar power to mine that can predict the future!
But you seem to activate it subconsciously and confuse it with your own memories.
Out of the 100 Exceeds that evacuated...
I suspect you're the only one who foresaw fragments of Edolas's future...
Everything is for the Kingdom...
The magic power in this world is vanishing.
The children are for defeating the Dragon Slayers...
That is their mission...
And, it seems like you mistook it for your mission.
But...
Then, I'm...
There never was such a mission.
Bad luck piled up and you somehow created a non-existent mission for yourself.
That was all seeing the future, too?
We took advantage of the fact that you didn't know your own power
by making you think you were being manipulated.
Sorry!
It was all an act to maintain the majesty of the Queen!
I truly apologize...
Much bad luck, and the false front I had to show the citizens,
combined to cause you great suffering.
And moreover, six years ago,
when I stole up the eggs from people's families, I caused incredible sorrow...
That is why I handed you that sword.
It is not the Exceed as a whole who are at fault.
It is I alone.
Men!
That's not true, Queen!
Everything you did, Queen, you did looking out for us!
And we were overconfident in ourselves.
Since we're here in Earthland and all...
We've discovered a new goal!
This time, let's get along with the humans!
It's our big new start!
Forward-looking bunch, aren't they?
Everyone...
A new beginning... What a wonderful thing to be able to say!
Fine. I'll accept it.
Carla...
But, why do I have the same power you do?
G-Good question...
I'm hungry...
Nice weather we're having...
They're acting weird...
Hey, Mister.
Yeah?
Don't you think the Queen and Carla look kinda similar?
You think?
Aye! You know, like how they move.
How they move?
See, like that part!
What part is that?
Well, I'm just glad that ended with everyone safe and sound.
Yes!
Hey, it looks like you caught it from him, Natsu!
So did you.
Wait a moment, what beauty!
Yes, a lovely parfum!
This guy's...
More...
I want to smell more of your parfum!
Cut it out, you!
H-How cruel... And after all I...
Sorry... You reminded me of someone I know.
For now, we'll live near here.
We can see each other any time!
Why're you so happy about that?
Yes...
We can see each other whenever we want, Carla!
Qu...
So warm...
Come over and play whenever you'd like, Happy.
Aye!
Not like I'm expectin' ya to, or anythin'!
I like the way you two smell.
I wonder why that is?
You're a hundred years too young to start smelling me, buddy!
Later!
Stay well!
Yeah! See ya!
Later!
Bye-bye for now!
Thank you so much, everyone...
I hate these depressin' farewells.
Oh, Dear...
Come play anytime!
Until next time!
Bye-bye!
Lovely parfum!
See you later!
Why didn't you tell her you're her mother?
Until every child I sent to be evacuated 6 years ago is found,
I have no right to claim that name.
And what about you?
A greenhorn like that ain't no son-o-mine!
You can see him whenever you'd like now, though...
It's just...
I didn't know your own daughter was in one of those eggs.
I was just Queen in name only.
For a parent, one's child is always the most precious.
Can't argue with that!
Okay!
Let's return to our guild.
How should we report this to everyone?
But, no one noticed what happened, right?
But we can't keep quiet about what happened to Mystogan.
Everyone... Your hands...
Hold it a sec!
Wait, Gajeel? You wanna do it, too?
It's fun!
If there was a point to it!
Where's Lily?
I ain't seen Panther Lily around anywhere!
Lily?
That super-strong Exceed.
If you want me, I'm right here.
Dinky!
Dinky!
You sure got cutesy.
It seems as if Earthland does not match well with my constitution.
Are you sure you're okay there?
Right now, I want to join this guild that took care of the Prince.
You'll keep your promise and get me in? Right, Gajeel?
Of course I will, partner!
He's crying!
Now, about another matter... I caught someone suspicious.
A big catch right off the bat!
That's my cat for ya!
Come here!
W-Wait!
I-I'm not... anyone... suspicious...
Hey!
I'm a member of Fairy Tail, too...
Lisanna...
What's with this cat? Are you an Exceed?
I am Panther Lily.
What's yer problem? You talkin' crap'bout my cat?!
But that's impossible...
Lisanna!
My... Somehow Edolas's Lisanna...
What'll we do?
Natsu!
Finally, I get to see you...
I get to see the real Natsu...
Happy!
It's me, Lisanna!
And Gray, Erza... How long has it been?
Wow, this brings back so much!
These are new guild members, I gather?
A little Wendy...
And Lucy?
Hold on a sec... Don't tell me you're...
Yeah.
No way!
You came back from the dead?!
Hold it!
We all thought you died two years ago.
I can't believe you've come back from the dead.
I never died.
Two years ago...
Lisanna, open your eyes, Lisanna!
What the...
What's happening? Stop it!
Lisanna, why?!
Wait!
Don't leave me alone!
You can't disappear!
No, please!
I suspect that I was sucked into an Anima then...
At the time, there should have been a lot of small Anima around Earthland, I bet.
When I came to in Edolas, I was shocked.
A guild?
Everyone was a little different, but there were familiar faces right there.
Plus, everyone assumed I was Edolas's Lisanna.
I figured that Edolas's Lisanna had already died.
I could tell from the way the guild treated me.
Lisanna's alive, Nee-chan!
When you fell from so high up... I thought you were done for!
I didn't understand at the time, but when I think about it now,
perhaps the Anima was trying to complete something Edolas lacked,
by sucking me up when their Lisanna died...
Don't go anywhere ever again!
Lisanna!
Um...
I couldn't say the truth.
I pretended to be Edolas's Lisanna.
I'm... home.
I was unsure at first, but soon my memories got jumbled,
and I learned bit by bit about Edolas...
Together with everyone, I got used to the way of life in Edolas.
Then, after two years passed...
Six days ago Earthland Natsu and Happy showed up.
Back then?
Why didn't you tell us the truth then?
I just couldn't...
So you're saying you've come from another world called Earthland?
What's the matter, Lisannna?
It's Natsu...
That's the Natsu and Happy I know...
I can't let them find out...
I don't want to make Mira-nee and Elf-niichan sad ever again...
I've got to get through this..
I'm going to live on here in Edolas!
But...
Hey, Lisanna!
Your body...
T-That's not it, everyone! I'm...
It's okay... We know.
Sorry about not saying that we realized...
You're a kind girl, just like our Lisanna that died...
So you mustn't make your real big brother and sister cry any longer.
Mira-nee... Elf-niichan!
Go back to the world you came from, Lisanna.
Give our best wishes to the Earthland versions of us...
Mira-nee!!!
Earthland... Kardia Cathedral.
Nee-chan, we should get going...
Just a little longer.
Mira-nee!
Mira-nee!
Elf-niichan!
No way...
Lisanna!
I'm home.
Well, that's strange... Where'd it go?
What's wrong?
The thing I left out for a snack today is all gone.
You've been leaving stuff out all over the place.
What did you leave out?
I had flames left over from last night's dinner, so I put'em into a tin...
But now it's totally empty!
Next time: That Which Erases Life.
Oh, yeah... Mira put it out, saying it could start a fire...
It was her!
I'm with Mira on this one...
