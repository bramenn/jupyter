It appeared as though humanity would be destroyed by the demons.
But a single mage saved them all.
He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
Yami, Asta, Charmy, and Finral came to report to the Wizard King
after their battle at the Underwater Temple.
And then...
I'm sorry to interrupt.
The border town of Kiten, which has a history of skirmishes with the Diamond Kingdom,
is under attack by a Diamond Kingdom squad.
Wh-What's with that massive horde of people?!
Three of the Eight Shining Generals.
What are the Eight Shining Generals?
The eight strongest from the Diamond Kingdom.
They're similar to the Magic Knights Captains of the Clover Kingdom.
The first ones to arrive at Kiten in their time of need were...
That's
The Clover Kingdom's most powerful Magic Knights Squad.
The Golden Dawn!
Yami and the others headed to Kiten as reinforcements.
Just you wait, Yuno!
Let's make them regret barging into our country with their muddy boots.
Whoever's Strongest Wins
Man, you girls sure are cute!
I know a meadow where there are flowers as beautiful as you two.
Say, why don't we take a little trip there with my spatial magic?
What's the matter? You look like you just saw something really scary.
They're going to murder us!
Hey! What's the big idea?!
Relax, la.
Shut up! Hurry up and get us to the town called Kiten!
Huh? But I thought we were off today...
You don't get any time off.
You can have all the time off you want once you're dead.
What?!
Let's do this, Finral!
Hurry up with the portal already, you bastard.
C'mon, let's see how far you can jump.
Are you mugging me now?!
We're counting on you, Finral!
Why are you so raring to go?!
My meal-saving prince!
What are you even talking about?
Let's go!
Huh, what?
Hurry it up!
Okay, fine! Here we go!
It's the Golden Dawn!
So you're the advance guard for the Golden Dawn?
Not bad for a little brat!
Goodness.
Such a wretched form for a Shining General.
How unsightly.
Lagus!
I can't bear to watch. I'll lend you a hand.
No one asked for your help!
He's mine!
It appears that the people have great faith in him.
Lagus! Listen to me when I'm talking to you!
In that case, let's see if you can protect yourself as well as your people!
Arrows... Bell.
Yup! Leave it to me!
Wind Magic: Swift White Bow.
What?!
Impossible!
He easily deflected my fastest lightning-coated arrows
and even broke through my barrier?
See if you can actually protect them?
That's my line.
Wh-Who are you?
Let's see if you can protect yourself and your comrades.
Yeah! Yeah!
Yuno and I are one, right?
Hey, why are you ignoring me? At least say something!
Something.
Really?! Quit messing with me, you smart-ass!
Want my help now, Lagus?
How dare he make me look like a fool?
He's mine! Stay out of my way, Brocks!
He's mine! You stay out of my way!
He's mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
What are you talking about?!
Yuno's mine!
Not a chance.
Good grief.
The kid I encountered in the dungeon has gotten a lot stronger.
Man, it's not fair how fast kids grow.
Way to make an old man feel older.
My girls are growing up fast, too.
When they were younger,
they always said they wanted to marry me when they grew up.
But now they won't even take baths with me.
And they don't want my underwear washed with their clothes...
A-Adjutant General Lotus?
And they say my breath smells like onions...
Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!
There's no end to them!
All these people...
They're all so weak!
His magic keeps clinging to us, making our spells not work properly!
There.
Slime Creation Magic: Mucusnail!
This spell drastically weakens the magic of anyone it catches.
You'll never be able to get out of there.
I just love watching powerless weaklings writhe in agony.
Wow, that looks like a tough spell to deal with.
Though, I mean, it's pretty useless against me.
What was that spell?
Spatial magic?
Yikes... The one thing about this spell is that it sort of destroys anything.
Oh, well. I guess someone will just have to rebuild it.
Let's see... That guy's definitely the leader of the Golden Dawn.
I wonder why he's just standing there. How creepy.
He's got his grimoire open, so I think he's using magic, but...
All I see is what looks like tree roots spreading.
A spell to grow a huge tree?
That sounds nice and peaceful.
But there's no one who could summon a spell big enough to protect this whole city.
He's using other people's magic?
Why do I always notice stuff like this?
Calling the three generals! This is Adjutant General Lotus.
The enemy general, the captain of the Golden Dawn,
Mine!
seems to be activating a large-scale magic attack.
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
At the very least, the range will include all of Kiten.
Mine!
I repeat! The captain of the Golden Dawn is activating a large-scale magic attack.
And they're definitely not listening.
What should I do? Run?
The time is at hand.
The great tree shall now bloom!
What the heck is this insane magic?
World Tree Magic: Great Mistilteinn Tree.
All for the Clover Kingdom's prosperity.
So this is Kiten.
Wait, whoa! What the heck is this giant tree?!
Trees like that grow around here?
Do you think there's giant fruit up there?!
Okay, that's enough out of you idiots.
This is probably Captain Shiny's spell.
Wait, what?! This is a spell?
Maybe they didn't need us after all.
Really? Let's go back, then! Please?
Nah. I'm gonna go check and see how the battle's going.
I'm assuming Captain Shiny's up top.
I'm gonna head up there. You three help the townspeople, and try not to die.
Leave it to us!
Hey! Y-Yami!
First, I'm gonna get me a piece of that fruit.
Asta's hurt, and Charmy's... drooling.
Yeah... I'm nervous.
Good grief.
Apparently, there was an incredible amount of magic on that battlefield.
I suspect this cleaned up most of it, though.
We've suffered a huge loss! Our army's basically wiped out!
Our army... has basically been wiped out?
Curse you!
You know what they say about people who get greedy.
How unsightly.
My arms might be useless, but I've still got my legs!
Everyone! Please come this way to escape!
Please get on this, la.
Are you hurt? Please, come this way.
Thank you.
It is our duty as Magic Knights to save the citizens of the kingdom.
If you're not busy,
why don't we... get some tea later?
Whoops. If I look down, my tears will...
La?
Someone's going head-to-head with one of the Diamond guys in the sky.
Yuno!
My meal-saving prince!
Go! Go! My lovely prince!
You can do it, you can do it, my lovely prince!
This young man is so strong...
Inconceivable! I'm one of the Eight Shining Generals!
You shall fall before my beautiful magic!
Beautiful?
Beauty doesn't matter in battle.
Whoever's strongest wins. That's all there is to it.
So beautiful...
He defeated him with a single blow!
Such a refreshing breeze...
I thought I saw a familiar little speck.
What are you doing here, Asta?
That guy joined the Magic Knights the same time Asta did.
Not to mention you're all torn up, scrambling around, and soaked with sweat...
Talk about ugly.
He worked his way up into the Golden Dawn's elite?
Of course he'd make fun of the Black Bulls. All that and he's handsome, too.
He's probably super popular.
The fact that you're so beat up means...
You got stronger again, didn't you?
Huh?
I'm not losing to you, Asta.
Yuno's... smiling?
La...
I-I could eat a hundred bowls of rice along with that smile.
Look who's talking! You got crazy strong, too, you jerk!
I'm not gonna lose either, Yuno!
He's an elite in the Golden Dawn,
has super powerful magic, and is super handsome...
Yet he's competing with Asta,
a member of the Black Bulls, who's a meathead with zero magic!
They must be great rivals.
Are you all right, Yuno?
Are you hurt at all?
Asta!
Asta!
What happened to your arms?!
Are they gravely hurt?! Are you all right?!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Not that I was worried or anything.
You got hurt because you let your guard down!
Pay more attention!
R-Right...
I'll heal you immediately with my recovery magic.
I'm fine. Go ahead and heal all the citizens.
Oh, my goodness! I shouldn't have been so forward!
I'm so sorry!
That's right! We don't have time to deal with you!
Let's go, Mimosa.
Right.
Yuno, you stay near Asta.
I'm sure you can't fight with your arms like that.
But I'm not trying to spoil you or anything!
You can go now.
Please take care, Asta!
Bye-bye! Ow...
I finally found you.
You must be the captain of the Golden Dawn.
I had completely underestimated you. Who knew you'd have such tremendous magic?
You've got impressive magic yourself.
There's no reason to perish in vain.
Take your comrades and leave this land.
What?
Diamond soldiers never retreat!
Red Clay Magic: Brilliant Armor Heavy Artillery!
What's that weak little spell supposed to do?
Let me guess... You must be out of magic already.
Victory is mine!
World Tree Magic: Mistilteinn Seed.
You should be honored.
Your magic has nourished the Clover Kingdom.
A Diamond ambush? He must've been hiding with his magic concealed.
Yami!
'Scuse me... Shiny Oddball Masked Dude.
Ouch.
I thought that if I could manage
to bag the Golden Captain, I could turn things around, but...
To think the guy I fought back then would show up.
And he's even stronger now to boot.
Please stop leaving this old guy so far behind.
Looks like you owe me one, Vangeance.
You saved me, Yami.
Ki, was it? How astounding.
Hey, old Diamond dude that I don't know.
Wanna surrender?
Wait, really? You don't remember me?
Look. Right here.
I've got no interest in your filthy-looking chest.
Don't make me cut you down.
D'oh...
So, what's it gonna be?
This is definitely bad news...
But now's the time to show you guys what a true Diamond looks like, and...
Retreat!
Didn't hesitate one bit. I like that.
Well, then...
Now that we're alone in a spot with such a great view,
why don't we have a little chat, Vangeance?
Man, your world tree magic is as impressive as ever.
Please. It's possible thanks to the enemies' magic.
Right... Your magic is world tree magic.
It is.
Exactly what are you trying to say, Yami?
I'm someone who believes his gut instincts.
Vangeance...
Could you take off that mask?
Petit Clover!
