Great, great, Issei! Push it, push it, Issei! One more time!
Karasuno Wakunan
Sorry... I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
So go on ahead.
He's really pumped about going to the bathroom.
He must need to take a shit.
Say poop! You're so vulgar, Kageyama-kun!
Crap.
I don't think he actually went to the bathroom...
Poop.
Crap.
Poop.
Crap.
Poop!
Ukai-san...
I'm sorry for wasting my chance.
How effectively you serve
will determine if you can win or not.
I heard your direction during the Fukurodani match and understood it...
And I understood my role.
And then I thought I wanted to be able to fight, too...
But...
I ran away at the last minute.
Please...
Give me one more chance.
Oh, shut up already. I know.
Please put me in.
Haikyu!!
Kyotani, get one more in!
Sorry! It's long!
Mattsun!
Episode 22: The Former Coward's Fight
All right!
Damn it. Sorry!
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
This isn't good.
Seijoh's 16 is finding his groove.
Great, great, Issei! Push it, push it, Issei! One more time!
They're ahead by five...
Karasuno, fight!
Let's move back a little.
He's probably not going to drop it up front.
Yeah.
Right.
Nice serve!
Bring it, bring it, bring it...
Tanaka!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
It's only just begun!
Shoyo, nice serve!
Hey! That guy...
Pardon me. We're switching players.
Oh, there he is. The scaredy cat pinch server.
Right. The guy who was in the match with Wakunan, too.
Though I totally understand getting freaked out.
I would hate having to serve during a pinch.
He's the one that got all stiff and failed miserably last time, right?
Yeah...
Yamaguchi, get 10 points!
That'd end the match...
I'd forgive you.
G-Give it to'em good, Yamaguchi!
R-Remain calm... Calm.
Nice serve!
Nice serve.
Give it your all!
Right!
One, and...
Yamaguchi, one more! Nice serve!
Eight seconds...
You know there's time after the whistle blows for you to serve, right?
Yes.
You basically get freaked out by the whistle and then
do your serve toss almost every time.
Don't be so panicky.
Yes...
Well, all that's left is this.
You went to Ukai's, right?
Yes.
On your own.
Then you're already a completely different player.
Go out there and do what you want to do.
All of their players have the nerve to get serious...
Out!
All right!
All...
He did it...
Tadashi!
Nice serve!
It got in!
We're...
Wait, what? Isn't that a bit overboard?
Yamaguchi, nice serve!
That's just one point.
That's it! Get one more!
A no-touch ace!
Go and catch up!
I'm sorry.
Don't mind! Don't worry about it.
It changed a lot... Even I thought it was out.
This is why I hate jump floats.
That was awesome, Yamaguchi! Why, you little...
R-Right...
It's not that surprising.
There you go again...
In these five months,
he practiced serving more than anyone else.
Why you little...
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
Yamaguchi, one more!
Give it all you've got!
Give it all you've got, Yamaguchi!
He'll be fine.
You always feel worse after you run away.
I'm pretty sure Yamaguchi feels that way, too.
A shot to break through the skin...
Yeah, and...
The start of our counterattack.
Cut it off!
Yeah.
In volleyball, where it's important to connect with your teammates,
the serve is the only solitary play.
Yeah...
It can also be said that it's the only play where you can score on your own.
As volleyball evolved,
the serve's power and motive has evolved more than anything else.
And in modern volleyball, the serve is a powerful attack
that won't get caught by the wall known as the block.
Kyotani!
Damn it!
A s-second service ace!
Yes!
All right!
Yamaguchi!
Nice serve.
What the heck is that serve? That was awesome.
Yamaguchi-kun!
Yamaguchi!
One more!
Bring it!
Got it!
You catch jump floats
with an over-handed hit!
Makki, nice.
He picked it up! They're going to attack.
This fear when you change from being the hunter to becoming the hunted...
Iwaizumi!
He received it with his body?!
Not yet... Not yet.
I'm not going to let you serve just yet!
Cover!
Thanks, Kageyama...
Tsukishima, get the last!
All right!
Tsukki...
A wipe!
They used that block really well.
Tsukishima!
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
Now they've gotten three consecutive points.
One more.
Yeah!
Oh? Seijoh's taking a time out.
They're physically stopping the momentum.
All right!
Making Seijoh take a time out is amazing, Yamaguchi!
Yamaguchi!
Th-Thank you...
That 12... made a really bold receive.
That was just luck, though.
Wow...
It hurts a lot...
All right! Let's win this!
Keep it up!
I want to be able to control my body like the other guys!
I want to be able to control the ball!
I want to fight head-on with strong opponents!
All right!
Yamaguchi!
One more!
Keep your eye on the ball!
Right!
Listen up, Tadashi.
You can't give them the chance to take the ball.
Aim straight through, as close as you can get to the white...
my serve.
The chance I received is just one service chance.
I'm going to fight putting my pride and the flow of the game into that shot.
I am...
a pinch server.
It's in!
Is luck on our side now?
No, it's not just that.
Now...
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
We're tied.
Haikyu!!
Haikyu!!
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
Now they're tied!
Karasuno caught up!
Yamaguchi!
That same net drop happened during the Wakunan match, too, right?
Tadashi's a lucky boy!
Yup, yup!
It might be a net drop,
but it's completely different from the one during the Wakunan match.
During the Wakunan match,
Yamagauchi, one more!
Tadashi was thinking about whether or not the ball would go in.
Yamaguchi, nice serve!
Right now, he's thinking about
where he's going to serve it.
This net drop was a result of switching to offense.
How awesome, Tadashi!
Though I'm sure he's entirely comfortable with that.
One more, Yamaguchi!
The serve toss keeps getting really low.
Right!
Let's calm down, now.
I am calm.
That one couldn't be helped.
We'll get the next one.
That's it, you guys!
You guys are too great. It makes your captain sad.
It's got a loose spin!
It's not changing direction!
Got it!
Nice receive!
One-touch!
Nice one-touch!
Azumane-san!
Nice, Kageyama!
Three blockers!
And a very high block...
Back!
Out!
All right!
Tanaka, nice call!
H-Hey, seriously?
They...
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
Karasuno's at match point!
One more! Nice serve!
Yamaguchi-kun...
Just one more point...
Just one more point and we win!
Get it in! Please, get it in!
Tadashi!
Yamaguchi! Just one more!
Get it in there!
Feels good...
I'll get it!
Damn it, they're good.
Nice, Watacchi!
Stop it!
Stop it, please!
All right!
Nice kill!
Great, great, Hajime! Push it, push it, Hajime! One more time!
We finally cut it off...
How many points did he get, anyway?
That was magnificent!
Good job!
Thank you.
You did great, Yamaguchi!
All right!
Thanks!
That was awesome!
Concentrate on the one!
Next time,
I'll get 10 points.
I'm not gonna lose!
Hanamaki, nice serve!
The chance that Yamaguchi gave us...
Daichi-san!
We're not gonna let it go to waste!
All right!
Nice, Azumane!
They're there again!
Match point!
Go!
All right!
They got it back so easily.
They managed a quick even though they're being cornered right now.
Not to mention, right up front.
If it were me, I'd be relying on the ace.
Yeah!
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
Nice receive!
There're two!
All right!
Tsukishima, nice kill!
Hey, your movements are stiff, Kindaichi.
Yes! No!
Which is it?
This is a critical moment for us.
We can't make this the third-years' last match.
Don't think about anything unnecessary.
No matter what, you only need to focus on
the ball in front of you.
Right!
Asahi, get this!
Nice serve!
It's long! Get this!
Great, great, Yutaro. Push it, push it, Yutaro! One more time!
All right!
Nice kill!
Thanks!
I guess that's to be expected of Seijoh.
The next one is going to be huge.
But...
And...
that won't get caught by
the wall known as the block.
That was basically a spike...
All right!
All right!
Great, great, Toru! Push it, push it, Toru! One more time!
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
Seijoh turned it around into a set point!
Are they going to get the set?
Damn it!
This isn't possible with just the two of us.
Asahi, please. We're counting on you.
Yeah.
Azumane-kun's going to be receiving the serve, too?
If that's what Sawamura and Nishinoya decided,
then that's probably best.
It appears that Oikawa's serves focus more on power than control.
Rather than them scoring a no-touch,
touching and getting the ball up in any way is better.
We received plenty of Ubugawa's and Fukurodani's serves.
It's okay. We can fight.
Bring it!
Nice serve!
Daichi-san!
Good!
Tanaka, nice!
Kageyama!
Asahi!
Asahi-san!
Nice receive!
All right!
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
They got the set back.
I thought Karasuno was just going to win straight through.
And we had them cornered!
Don't mind!
We're just getting started!
Damn it! That third set is gonna be rough!
Let's change it up!
Right!
His serve really is amazing.
You were awesome, too, Yamaguchi.
He's much more experienced than I am.
That might be obvious because he's a third-year,
but I don't think that's the only thing.
Not the only thing?
A jump serve is a serve that balances a lot of power with a high risk.
To be able to add force to his serve
and still have it land in when they were cornered like that...
He's something special.
Yamaguchi!
Those were nice serves!
Th-Thanks.
But I've still got a ways to go.
Only half of my serves were any good.
Then be super happy about the half that were good!
Even if you put aside regret, you'll end up feeling it anyway.
Right now, you need to make sure you grasp this good feeling
and never forget it.
Grasp really hard.
And do it again next time, too.
Yes!
So we ended up getting a full set...
Our first practice match,
the Inter-High prelims...
And now...
We're having our most intense match yet.
Difficult opponents...
Troublesome opponents...
We didn't even have much of a connection with them until last year...
They were supposed to be beneath us...
But apparently we're fated to play to the fullest.
Aoba Johsai Karasuno
The final set...
Rule the Court
Fly
This is our last battle!
That was amazing, Yamaguchi-kun!
Th-Thank you very much, Yachi-san.
Just in case, I had an AED, stretcher, and coffin prepared,
but they weren't necessary at all!
Huh?! Wasn't there something that didn't belong at the end there?
