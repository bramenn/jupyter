Hey all you viewers out there!
When you're watching Fairy Tail keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen, all right?
Previously on Fairy Tail...
Let's go on an S class quest, Lucy!
And that's how we were forced by Lucy to come to the cursed island, Galuna!
You're the ones who invited me!
And there were dogs, and eyebrows, and sideburns and a giant frozen monster!
You lost me there.
Deliora...
A demon your teacher sealed?
Yes, it's Deliora all right.
So it was transported from the Northern Continent to here?
Maybe the island's curse has to do with this demon?
Seems like the obvious conclusion.
This demon is still alive, after all.
All righty then!
All we's gotta do is bust up this demon!
Is force your only solution to every problem?
Just watch me!
Gray hit him!
That's not really that uncommon. but...
Hey! What's the big idea?
Don't get near it, you Fire Wizard!
If that ice melts, and it's freed, no one would be able to stop it!
What? Would that ice really melt all that easily?
No...
Are you okay?
Hey, I'm the one who got punched!
You're a barbarian!
My master, Ul, encased the demon using an Iced Shell spell.
That's ice that can't melt.
No matter what kind of magical fire you use, you couldn't melt that ice.
If they knew they couldn't melt it, then why move it here?
I don't know, but maybe they're trying to melt it somehow?
But, why?!
I don't know!
Something isn't right here.
Who brought Deliora here, and for what reason?
Well, it's pretty simple.
We should just chase after those guys from before.
Yeah.
No.
We wait here.
For what?
We wait until the moon comes out.
The moon?
But it's still noon!
No way, no how! I'd be bored to death!
Gray, what are you talking about?
I think that this island's curse and Deliora are both connected somehow with the moon.
And those guys also said, Soon we'll have collected enough moonlight.
I see.
I am curious about what'll happen and what they're up to.
I can't stand it!
I'm going after them!
That was fast.
Aye!
Moon Drip!
This guy really just lives on instinct, you know?
Aye. That's Natsu for you.
I'm almost kind of jealous.
Gray, can you keep up?
My training is harsh.
You bet! I'll do anything!
Waiting is pretty boring.
Aye.
That's it!
Gate of the Harp, I open thee!
Lyra!
Heya! Long time no see, Lucy!
Hi, Lyra!
Why don't you call me more often?
I want to be lots and lots more helpful to you!
Lucy, you're such a meanie!
A meanie?
But I can only call you three days a month!
Oh, really?
We got another weirdo here.
So, what kind of song would you like me to sing today?
Whatever you want. Your choice.
I'd like a song about fish!
Then I'll play whatever comes to mind!
Lyra is very good at singing.
Mira is also a good singer. She sings me songs about fish, too.
Words given birth...
Words dieing out...
The words living on inside of you...
Time seems to stand still, changes into courage...
Now, step out...
You'll become stronger than you were.
Be lost no longer.
Believe in those words back then.
Hey, uh... Gray?
What?
You're crying?
It's true that Lyra has the power to sing songs that reflect what's in people's hearts.
Gray was crying.
No, I wasn't!
Sing a happier song, Lyra!
Oh! Then tell me that before hand.
Now that I think about it, what if someone comes along?
Be quiet.
What's that noise?
It's night?
Light's coming down from...
Purple light!
It's light from the moon!
What the heck?
What's going on?
It's landing on Deliora.
This ain't no coincidence!
Let's go!
We'll search for where the light is coming from!
Aye!
A magic circle is spread over the center of the ruin!
It's farther above!
Zeram...sem... Deioluna!
What's that?
Kuupelar Kulrakar Zeram...sem... Deioluna!
Kuupelar Kulrakar...
The moon!
They're really collecting the light from the moon.
What are they trying to do by shining it on Deliora?
It's a spell in Belianese... Moon Drip!
Wait, you're still here?
I see. So that's it.
What? What is it?
They're using Moon Drip to resurrect that demon!
What?
You're kidding me!
Iced Shell is ice that can't be melted!
The magic that can melt it is the Moon Drip.
The collected magic of the moon has the power to undo any magic.
Oh, no!
These guys don't know the horror of Deliora!
I think the curse that the people believe is on this island is a side-effect of the Moon Drip.
The collected magic from the moon is contaminating their bodies.
That's just how powerful a magic it is.
Damn them!
Hold it!
Someone's coming!
Damn it, I'm all sleepy after waking up at noon.
And we never did find the intruders.
If they even existed!
It is saddening, Reitei-sama.
There seemed to be intruders around noon, but we failed to catch them.
I cannot express my love like this.
Intruders...
So that's Reitei.
What a big shot... He's even wearing a funky mask.
Really? I think it's cool.
Has Deliora been revived yet?
At this rate, either today or tomorrow...
Which one is it?!
Finally...
As for the intruders, I will brook no interference.
Yes. The only other people here should be the villagers on the far side of the island.
Destroy the village.
Yes.
Understood.
What?
But the people in the village had nothing to do with it!
That's messed up!
I would rather avoid bloodshed, however...
That voice... It couldn't be...
I can't stand sneakin' around anymore!
Your interferers are right here!
Well I guess we have to do this now, don't we?
How can I help?
Want me to sing again?
You, go back.
Aw, you're no fun.
That mark... They're from Fairy Tail.
I see. So the people from the village requested a guild save them.
What are you doing? Eliminate the village now.
Why?
Anyone who interferes or plots against me is my enemy.
Why?
Why, you...
I'll stop this crazy ritual of yours!
He also used ice?
Lyon...
Huh?
Lyon?
You bastard... Do you have any idea what you're doing?
How long has it been, Gray?
What's the meaning of this?
I can't believe you were the wizard the villagers called here.
Did you come knowingly?
Or is this just a coincidence?
Well, no matter.
Reitei Lyon, you know him?
Go now. I can handle things here myself.
You think we'll let you go so easily?!
Stop Natsu! Don't move!
Natsu!
Happy! Take care of Lucy!
Aye!
Hey!
Damn it, I can't move!
Happy, are you abandoning Natsu?
He got encased by magic that freezes air!
At this rate we'll be turned to ice next!
But, what'll happen to Natsu?
If we're all done in, who'll protect the village?!
I'm sorry... It took a lot of effort to keep yourself from helping Natsu, didn't it?
I'm sure Natsu'll be fine!
You think ice'd work against the Salamander?
Aye!
So you bought enough time for the woman and cat to get away?
No matter... Sherry and the rest should have no problems against them.
Don't underestimate Fairy Tail wizards, you!
Aye!
What are you doing?
Always the one for theatrics.
Wasn't he your ally?
You could magically explode that ice ball whenever you felt like it.
So you made sure he's out of my magical power's range?
Not bad, there.
Enough with the elder-student act already, Lyon.
You're no longer Ul's pupil!
Neither are you, Gray.
Since Ul's no longer of this world.
She gave her life to seal away Deliora!
You're the one trying to destroy her legacy!
Don't rewrite history.
You're the one who killed Ul!
And yet you lived on, unashamed, Gray.
Damn that Gray! I'll remember this!
What's with this ice, though? I can't melt it with fire...
I don't have time for this! I've got to get to the village!
Damn it! It's hard to run like this!
Why do you want to go to that island?
Shut up and steer.
Give us a break here!
Galuna island is cursed! The rumors say that humans turn into demons!
I don't care.
Uh... Oh.
I am going to punish some rule breakers.
That is all.
Cool!
You're awesome!
Let's go, Ma'am!
We'll follow you anywhere!
Hurry!
Aye, sir!
Uh, can I join you too? Madam?
I'll say it again. You're the one who killed Ul.
How dare you even speak her name!
L-Lyon...
What's the matter?
Is the guilt stopping you?
Then don't get in my way.
Let me revive Deliora.
I won't let you!
So be it.
Let's have a match, just like old times.
Ice Make Eagle!
Ice Make Shield!
Your specialty is creating inanimate objects.
Static Icemake.
My creations are creatures. Moving Icemake.
Did you forget about ice that can move?
Ice Make Hammer!
Ice Make Ape!
Pitiful.
You still use both hands when you use creation magic?
That's what Ul taught us, remember?
If you use one hand to create, it'll be incomplete and off-balance!
I'm special!
I've long since surpassed Ul's ability!
Don't get a big head!
Same to you.
I wonder if you'll be able to land even a single hit on me.
Don't think I'm the same as I used to be!
Ice Geyser!
Same as you were.
I am the elder apprentice.
And stronger than you.
I could use creation magic with one hand, and you could not.
Nothing's changed.
We may have traveled different paths,
but both of us are frozen as we were at that time.
That's why I'll melt the ice!
In order to walk the path that was sealed!
My goal was Ul.
Surpassing Ul was my dream.
But you stole that dream from me.
I thought I would never have the chance to surpass Ul again.
But, there was one way.
If I could do what even Ul could not: defeat Deliora...
Then I can surpass Ul...
I can finally dream again!
Are you serious? That's your goal?
You should know all too well the horror of Deliora!
Stop! It's impossible!
Stop, it's impossible, you say?
That's exactly what we said to you back then...
You can't have forgotten that.
It's because you challenged Deliora that Ul's dead!
You have no right to speak Ul's name!
Begone!
Die!
It's Professor Happy's Fairy Tail Lecture!
Today we'll be telling you the secrets of Natsu, a Fire Wizard!
Natsu was raised by a dragon named Igneel.
He uses a rare kind of magic called Dragon Slayer where he eats and punches with fire!
His only weakness is transportation.
Until next time!
Stand, Bow, Aye!
That Deliora thing's damn big.
Almost 100 fish-lengths.
I wonder what it ate to get that big?
Fish has got lots of calcium in it, so it's got to be fish!
You think? I'd rather eat meat than fish.
Next time: Natsu vs. Yuka The Wave!
But you'd get arrested real quick if you got any bigger.
Huh? Why?
It'd be too easy for you to destroy towns.
