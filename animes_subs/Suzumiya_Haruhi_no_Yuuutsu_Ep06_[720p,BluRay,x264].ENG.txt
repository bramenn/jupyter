Good morning!
Apparently, the three of them, each for their own reasons...
Kyon-kun!
Wake up already!
Come on!
Even if I accept everything that's happened or been said...
You'll be late!
Hurry up!
Why me?
Aliens, time travelers...
Then what about me?
Why have I...
I'm off!
I'm a 100 genuine...
No special powers or anything.
Good morning!
Who came up with this scenario?
Was it you, Haruhi?
Yeah, right.
It's no concern of mine.
Why should I have to worry about this crap?
It looks like everything is Haruhi's fault.
In that case...
And as for Nagato, Koizumi, and Asahina-san...
Whatever happens to the world afterwards...
Run around all you want.
Just don't get me involved.
Yo!
Taniguchi.
I'm a normal high school student, right?
Not too sure about that.
A normal high school student...
And it was Yuki Nagato, an A- by my ranking.
I explained.
The story going through Taniguchi's mind...
Nagato was the unfortunate victim...
She was troubled...
I had to sympathize with her sincere request...
We decided to discuss remedial measures in the classroom...
Then Nagato's chronic anemia kicked in and she fainted...
Indeed, once the truth has been brought to light...
Liar.
Bah
Even if I believe your lies...
Nagato was that famous, huh?
Plus, you're one of Suzumiya's people.
If you can be considered a normal high school student...
Say, Taniguchi.
Can you use ESP?
I see...
You've finally been infected by Suzumiya's poison...
Stay away from me...
I'll catch Suzumiya.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya VI
Why aren't you getting changed?
Because it's hot.
Who cares.
I'll have to change again once I get to the clubroom anyway.
And I have cleaning duty later, and it's easier to move in these.
Guess that makes sense.
What should we have Mikuru-chan wear next?
After bunny and maid...
Wait!
There's more?
Kitty ears?
Nurse outfit?
Or perhaps a queen?
Kitty ears...
Nurse outfit...
Or a que
Dumb face.
You're the one who brought up the subject.
Seriously...
It's so boring...

I see.
That's what she meant.
Did you just figure something out?
No. It's nothing.
Huh?
What is this?
Jacked up!
Why is my name on here?
What's inside?
Show me, show me!
Uh, this is just, well...
I wonder what this is.
I'm sure it's nothing important.
Sounds like a lie.
Asahina-san.
Could you let go...
Geez.
Come on.
Just for a bit!
Okay? Okay?
Pretty please?
What are you people doing?
So maids turn you on?
What are you talking about?
I'm going to get changed.
Go ahead.
I said I'm going to get changed!
What about it?
Get out!
What's with her?
She never has any qualms about changing in the classroom.
My arms and shoulders feel cool...
Oh?
Was today a costume party?
Don't complicate the situation.
Mikuru-chan.
Sit down here.
They almost look like a pair of close sisters.
She probably just wants to turn her into a maid with braids.
In the end...
We didn't know what we wanted to do.
We didn't know what we should do.
We just let the clock tick by...
A moratorium sort of life.
The everyday happenings...
While I did feel a bit dissatisfied...
I could just tell myself, Oh well. There's still plenty of time.
And aimlessly look to the next day and repeat.
But still...
As for almost getting killed by a classmate...
That's right.
I wanted everything to stay this way.
Wouldn't anyone agree...
But there was someone who didn't agree.
You know who.
Haruhi Suzumiya.
What are you doing?
Scissors!
I need them for art tomorrow!
Okay.
Just say something first next time.
Premeditated crime, huh?
Incidentally...
Sleep...
When the body is resting...
This is when we dream.
Kyon.
Kyon!
My alarm clock hasn't gone off yet.
Wake up!
Don't wanna.
I told you to wake your ass up!
Do you know where we are?
I thought I had woken up...
What's going on?
Why are we at school?
Closed space.
I know I was sleeping in my bed...
And the sky looks strange...
Did you see Koizumi?
No...
Why?
No reason.
Just asking.
For now, let's escape from the school.
We might run into someone somewhere.
You don't seem very surprised.
I'm surprised.
Especially at the fact that you're here.
What is this!?
It extends all the way around the school premises.
So we can't get out?
If you're scared...
Creates more of an atmosphere.
Stupid.
Doesn't seem to work.
That's what I figured.
Kyon...
Look.
Where are we...
This gives me the creeps.
Want tea?
Don't want any.
What's going on?
What is this?
I don't get it.
Where are we?
Why am I in this place?
And why is it just you and me?
Hell if I know.
I'm going to go explore a bit!
You stay here.
I'll be right back!
Guess that's typical of her.
Koizumi?
Well, hello.
Took you long enough.
I was expecting you to appear in a more tangible form...
Regarding that...
I need to tell you a few things.
I'll be frank.
This is an abnormal situation.
When it's normal closed space...
However...
And it probably won't last very long.
The powers that rest within us...
What's going on?
Are Haruhi and I the only ones here?
Precisely.
What we feared has already begun to happen.
Suzumiya-san...
In other words...
What was that!?
The higher-ups in our organization are in a state of panic.
Nobody knows what will happen to our world...
If Suzumiya-san is feeling merciful...
But it could also return to nothing in the next second.
Why did this...
Who knows.
In any case...
You are not in ordinary closed space.
It is an entirely new dimension created by Suzumiya-san.
Perhaps all the previous instances of closed space...
The world you are in is probably the manifestation...
Though we aren't sure what it is that she wants.
Indeed, who knows what will happen.
Why am I in this place?
Do you really...
You have been chosen by Suzumiya-san.
The only person from the old world...
I thought that you had realized this long ago.
It would appear that I'm almost out of time.
The way things look now...
Do I have to live in this gray world...
Adam and Eve.
If you reproduce enough it'll work out?
I'll smack you.
Just a joke.
I would assume...
However...
Well...
If I happen to be born into the new world...
We can no longer go back to the old world?
If Suzumiya-san desires it...
The possibility is slim though.
As for myself...
Ah, that's right.
I was asked to deliver messages from Mikuru Asahina and Yuki Nagato.
Mikuru Asahina wanted to apologize.
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
Yuki Nagato said to turn on the computer.
Then, I'll be going.

Nagato!
What are you telling me to do, Nagato?
Koizumi?
Kyon!
Something's here!
What is that!?
A monster!?
It isn't a mirage, right?
Maybe it's an alien!
Or the revival of some super weapon developed by an ancient race!
Hey! What are you doing?
Say.
Do you think it'll attack us?
I don't think...
Dunno.
What is all this, seriously?
This weird world...
Don't you want to go back to our old world?
We can't stay in this place for the rest of our lives.
Doesn't look like there's a place to eat when we get hungry.
It's kind of strange...
I wonder why.
I'm having fun right now.
What about the SOS Brigade?
It's the club you made.
You're just gonna ditch it?
That doesn't matter anymore.
After all, look.
I'm having this really fun experience right now.
There's no need to go look for anything mysterious anymore!
I want to go back.
I found out something after being thrown into this situation.
I may complain all the time...
Including that idiot Taniguchi and Kunikida...
Koizumi, Nagato, and Asahina-san...
You can even...
What are you talking about...
I want to see them again.
I feel like I still have so many things I have to tell them.
I'm sure we'll see them.
This world won't be covered in darkness forever.
The sun will rise tomorrow.
I can tell.
That's not what I mean.
I don't mean in this world.
I want to see the old them...
I don't get it.
Weren't you fed up with that boring world!?
Didn't you want something more interesting to happen!?
I did indeed.
You know, Haruhi.
I've been through some really...
You probably don't know anything...
You just didn't know...
Nagato said...
The potential for evolution.
According to Asahina-san she was a time warp.
Koizumi treated her as God.
Then what about me?
What does the person Haruhi Suzumiya...
Haruhi is Haruhi and nobody else.
I'm not gonna use such tautology to dodge the question.
But...
Isn't that natural?
If someone points to the classmate sitting behind you...
How are you supposed to respond?
No, sorry.
Guess that's still dodging the question.
Haruhi isn't just a classmate to me.
Of course, she isn't the potential for evolution...
Couldn't possibly be!
Do you know what Snow White is?
What is it...
Actually...
Ponytails turn me on.
What?
That ponytail you had back whenever...
Are you retarded?
The hell was that dream!?
Freud would have a field day with this!
The most realistic dream l've ever had...?
Or...
This is no longer the old world.
It's the new world Haruhi created?
If that's the case...
Yo.
How you doing?
I feel miserable.
I had a nightmare last night.
I ended up not getting any sleep.
I've never wanted to skip school as badly as I do today.
Oh, really?
Haruhi.
What?
Looks good on you.
I must be grateful to you.
It looks like I won't be out of a job just yet.
Well, we can't discount the possibility that this world was...
In any case...
I'll see you after school.
You and Haruhi Suzumiya...
How many others like you...
Many.
Will another one like Asakura attack me?
Don't worry.
I won't let them.
Kyon-kun!
I'm so glad I could see you again...
I thought you'd never...
Asahina-san.
We... We mustn't!
If Suzumiya-san sees us like this...
I don't understand what you mean!
That's right, Asahina-san.
You have a star-shaped mole around this spot on your chest, right?
H-How did you know!?
I never knew it was shaped like a star!
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-When did you see it!?
What are you people doing?
Mikuru-chan.
You're probably sick of the maid outfit, right?
Come on.
Time to change!
Stop struggling!
Resistance is futile.
This time, you'll be a nurse. A nurse!
A nurse.
Or do they say hospital attendant these days?
Doesn't matter.
It means the same thing!
Let's talk a little about what happened afterwards.
I finally turned in...
The save the world by overloading it with fun...
The city-wide magical mystery patrol is also going strong.
Today would be the second occurrence.
By some freak coincidence...
So I'm waiting for Haruhi myself.
I arrived an hour before the meeting time.
Because the person who arrives last...
Is the scowl on her face...
I'll have plenty of time to ask later.
While Haruhi treats me at the cafe.
In fact...
Like what kind of activities she has planned for the SOS Brigade.
The costumes I'd like to see Asahina-san in, etcetera etcetera.
But well, when it comes down to it.
I already know what I'm going to tell her first.
Yes, for now...
I'm planning on telling her about aliens, time travelers, and espers.
