Here I am again.
Really? Are you sure?
Fwap
How many days of food expenses will we save from this?
This is wonderful! Thank you!
We got extravagant for New Year's, so she told us to be frugal for a while.
But now we can have delicious food from tomorrow!
Warm Warm
We were already done eating. Those are the leftovers, so I hope that's okay.
D-Delicious!
Th-The egg rice is delicious!
Hey, Rei. Can you sleep with Momo tonight?
That's a good idea!
Let's do that! After all, tomorrow's Saturday.
I have to go home tonight.
Why? Let's stay here together!
Why? Why, why, why?
Momo.
I've got a match coming up that I just can't lose.
So I have to go home and study.
Study? Do you have a test?
Yes. That's right.
It's a test where I show my opponent and myself how hard I've been trying.
Momo.
Then you have something to tell Rei.
Tell him what?
Um, Rei says he has a test.
Right. So what do you say at a time like this?
You say, Do your best.
Rei, do your best!
I will.
I'll do my best.
Black River (Part 2)
All right...
After that, I spotted Kiriyama just once at the Shogi Hall.
He was looking at shogi game records and making copies of them.
I was going to talk to him, but...
I saw that stern look on his face, and stopped.
Kiriyama had been gathering the game records for Shimada 8th-Dan, and Gotou 9th-Dan.
Just those two.
Sheesh. The little punk.
Man, that pisses me off. What a jerk.
He's totally ignoring the possibility that I could win?
And he expects to crush Mr. Shimada, then move right on to Gotou?
Who does he think he is?
I don't have it. A vision of me beating Gotou and then facing off against Mr. Shimada.
But I understand.
That's right.
That's what the problem is.
The vision Kiriyama sees isn't just a selfish figment of his imagination.
We're professionals.
Whether I accept it or look away,
deep down I measure my own ability with cruel precision.
Measuring that is what it means to be a professional.
There are some people who think, I may win
and there is a possibility that they will win.
I don't have it.
A vision of me beating Gotou and then facing off against Mr. Shimada.
And that's how it is.
But going from there, trudging on and sidling up to victory
is also part of a professional's job.
Gotou often uses the forms of Static Rook and Bear in the Castle.
In response, I'll use the Windmill.
If Gotou is heavy and stiff
I'll be light and expansive.
All right, please begin.
Let's have a good game.
This is my second time playing against Gotou.
Last time, to prepare for a drawn-out battle from Gotou's heavy defensive position,
I also strengthened the defense around my king,
but the nimbleness I always put my faith in was weakened by the armor it wasn't used to
and the result was a crushing defeat.
Based on that, I've come up with a number of countermeasures.
This time, I've decided to face him with what I excel at.
I won't shield my king much, but I'll move the pieces around quickly,
making countless small wounds, and stealing his vitality.
Against that...
Gotou will make a firm, measured defense, and attack me with a single massive strike.
If that strike hits me, it's over.
I can't let my concentration slip one millimeter.
But I'm ready to do this.
A match in which victory and defeat is decided 100 beforehand
doesn't exist between professionals.
Such unpleasant clouds, like it'll rain.
Actually, on the news they were saying it'll snow tonight.
No wonder. I thought it was especially cold out.
Just how much vitality does he have?
I keep wounding him, but he won't crumble.
There are no openings to attack.
I've drawn a lot of blood, but he hasn't flinched.
Conversely, my moves aren't getting very far right now.
And then...
Sacrificing his Rook for my Silver?
What the hell is he doing?
What is...
He's attacking me with tremendous force.
He'll pry me open!
Pitch black water is rushing in.
I can't breathe...
Just like that, I'm getting dragged down...
There's nothing I can do.
I lost.
You were light.
But still a little heavy.
After I moved 2-f-Bishop, you defended with 5-b-Gold from the left.
You should've gone up to 6-c-Gold instead.
The way you did it, the heaviness came out.
Lightness is your creed, right?
If so...
That was pathetic.
Not only was it a helpless, complete defeat, but my delusions were shattered as well.
A full course, huh?
Don't hesitate.
What's the deal with that heavy manliness?
How old is he? 41?
Will I be able to project that kind of punch in ten years?
I bet he's popular with the ladies.
Now I'm getting pissed off.
All right. For the rest of the night...
Course A. If it goes in, I drink my cares away at the usual hostess pub.
Course B. If I miss, I go home, get under the covers, and sob.
Rustle Rustle Rustle
Gasp!
Shiver Shiver Shiver
Could it be?
Perhaps a Course C?
Shrink Shrink
Course C: Bring a stray cat home and take care of it.
Mew...
What should I do?
Okay, already! I get it!
Okay, okay. Stop crying.
We'll start again.
You and me both, from square one.
Black River (Part 2)
Hey.
You look well.
Too bad.
I see.
If we keep going like this, you and I will go head to head.
Well, I'm looking forward to that.
It should be a little more interesting than beating you with my bare hands.
That's right.
I want you to pass on a message to your old man, Kouda.
It's about that stalker woman.
Tell him to get her off my back.
She's really annoying.
You know?
Beyond the Door
He was provoking me.
I know that.
But...
I have to do it.
First, I have to deal with today.
Nothing will start unless I win today.
Kai Shimada, 8th dan. Five years in Rank A.
I've been looking at a lot of his game records, but it's strange.
I can't find any distinctive features.
Tactics he's good at, his weaknesses...
There's nothing I can pinpoint.
I haven't played against him before.
But, wait...
When I was in grade school, he was a guest speaker
at a children's shogi tournament I attended.
He was awfully thin and tall, and I remember he spoke quietly.
I'd had a winning streak, so I just watched from afar.
He didn't really make an impression on me.
Instead of playing to win, he's someone who plays not to lose shogi.
Matches against people like that are usually drawn-out battles.
It's not my favorite.
But...
I can't get irritated.
That's where he'll eat me alive.
Stay calm.
Gotou recently gave it to me.
I can not lose here.
No matter what.
I went first for this match.
It's a Double Fortress.
It's been standard moves up to now.
All right, time to start the battle.
Here I go.
5-b-Rook?
Does he intend to block everything?
In that case...
He moved his Gold back.
Does he mean to move the Rook around? Then so will I.
Somehow...
At a time like this,
it's a good idea...
to surround the king.
Surround...
Wait a second.
Something's wrong.
I was supposed to be attacking.
And yet...
What is this?
When did the situation get this bad?
I didn't... make any mistakes.
No mistake, and yet...
And yet, what is this?
This...
This intensity?
I can't...
Crap!
Gold General
Knight
Geez. You finally look this way.
Shogi Hall
Big Brother!
What did you come here for, kiddo?
You don't have a match today.
Sorry, Big Brother.
How's your fever?
You still have one.
You need to take care. Your promotion is on the line.
You promised you wouldn't overdo it, remember? To both your teacher and me.
In exchange, we promised we wouldn't tell anyone.
Yes. I'll head home and lie down.
Sorry.
Well, me too.
Sorry for getting on your case like that.
I was just surprised to see you here.
So why are you here, kiddo?
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
Yes. Actually, Big Brother...
I want you to...
I want you to split Kiriyama's head in half.
Dang it, kiddo...
I was wondering what you were going to say.
Such a troublesome thing...
Well, then...
Let's continue, shall we?

You can't be eating cold food when you're depressed.
You'll lose half of your hit points.
Is that how it is?
What should I do? I can't understand it anymore.
Well, let's try advancing it from here.
March Comes in Like a Lion!
At long last, my Big Brother appears! You'll watch our brotherly love, right?
Big Brother!
