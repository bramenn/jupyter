hajimete no kimochi my first feelings
shonbori no mune ni upon my downhearted chest
sotto nagerareta hidamarine a sunny ray of light was gently thrown
hitori aruiteta walking alone...
sora miageta toki when I looked up at the sky,
haru ga soko ni kiteta spring was near,
misetekureta it showed me
kowareru omoiwa these trembling feelings are
maichiru hanabirane fluttering petals,
sukininatte iino is it okay for me to fall in love?
soretomo or will...
tamerau kokoro ga my hesitating heart
bureiki kakerukedo put on my brakes,
kurushikute it's so painful
ikiga tomarisou desu I can't breathe
Heat haze
That was my middle school.
Let's go see.
Okay.
You used to wear those too?
Yeah.
Looks like middle schoolers from the country.
Jeez.
Hello.
Hello.
He owns a tea shop in the neighborhood.
I see.
It sure is cold today.
You're right. It looks like it might snow.
My...
You must have left home very early to get here this early.
Sorry. We just suddenly decided to come.
That's right
I slept over at my brother's house last night.
I see. You guys must get along very well.
Oh yeah. What's that?
Oh, that?
That's just for a little change of mood.
Oh.
Well, take your time.
Yeah.
Yes, please. Oh yes, the shampoo you gave me last week, it's so good...
Koshiro?
Yeah?
Do be careful.
I think it's because a tile is cracked.
Could you at least try?
The leak is terrible.
I guess it can't be helped.
Man, it's freezing.
Is it fixed?
Probably... Actually, I don't know.
Eh, what? Which one?
That's because the kid next door...
Even if that's so, this is so bad.
Ah! Don't look!
You really do look like a middle schooler from the country.
Just because there aren't many photos of you, brother. It's not fair!
Jeez...
Oh, yeah. I found these too.
Your collection of compositions from elementary school.
Ah, mom, not that.
My dream is to become a beautician.
Jeez...
That is because my mother is a beautician, so I want to take after her.
I will also get married. I want lots of children.
I will call my mother, father and brother and we'll all live together.
Then I think it will be a lot of fun.
So she said.
It does seem like a lot of fun, though.
Your husband is going to have a tough time.
Umm...
Sorry for dropping in all of a sudden.
Umm... I'm sorry.
What are you saying?
You actually helped me out a lot.
At this rate, I would like you to come everyday.
Bye then...
Good night.
Be careful on your way back.
Should we commit lover's suicide?
I don't mind either way.
If you're okay with it, then I don't care which.
Don't say things like that.
I can't decide which...
I don't know... what to do... so easily...
Let's go home.
If you're not sure, then let's just go home for now.
I think it's fine to go home and then think it over.
Are you okay with that?
I'm fine.
That's why I said that I'm fine as long as I'm with you, brother.
And in the end, we're still alive.
Resignation
Unable to find the answer to...
What the right thing to do is...
Yo!
Hey.
You really did quit?
Yeah.
I really did quit.
What are you going to do from now on?
I haven't decided yet.
You sure do have absolutely no direction in your life.
If you're not able to do anything anymore, then you should just come back.
If I'm not able to do anything?
Do you really think it'll solve itself?
Sorry. I said that I wouldn't say anything anymore, didn't I?
Whatever happens... I can't wish you good luck, but...
Stay well.
Bye, now.
Let's go home, Nanoka!
Do you want to do some karaoke on the way?
Sorry, but there's somewhere I have to go.
Next time.
She doesn't hang out with us much anymore.
Yeah.
I bet it's a boyfriend.
I wonder.
Probably, most likely.
Yeah.
Do you want to follow her?
Let's follow her!
I want to see what kind of guy he is!
Nanoka's boyfriend!
But...
You guys peeped at my date!
Let's go!
What's wrong?
Let's not.
I'm kind of scared.
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
The one thing I do know is...
I'm home.
I'm home.
Let's eat.
This moment...
Itadakimasu.
Do you have everything?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Suburban shopping malls are the trend of life.
But if this place is gone, then I think that many people will be sad.
Actually, there are more people in favor than in opposition.
There isn't that kind of an institution around here, so...
I think many of the residents felt that it was inconvenient.
Ah, is that so?
I feel that destroying the row of trees would be wasteful.
But I guess you can't do business with just sentiment.
Sorry, but you...
Why, you!
No!
Come here, you...
Stop it.
You rascal!
I'll go clean myself.
Yeah.
Here!
For me?
Thank you.
What are you doing?
Come here.
Hey...
Hurry, brother!
Amusement parks are...
Hmm?
Is that so?
Wow!
How disappointing...
That it doesn't move.
I thought you said that it was fun even if it wasn't moving?
The ferris wheel is different.
You sure are hard to please.
But... it's better if it moves.
I bet it would be beautiful.
The town.
Yeah.
I wonder if we can't move it.
I was wondering if we can move it somehow.
How?
By praying.
Ehh...
You don't know unless you try.
But...
Come on, you try praying too.
It's impossible!
Don't give up so easily.
Come on, once more.
Ready...
We did it!
We did...
I can't believe it!
Once more, again!
Yeah...
Aren't we doing something stupid?
You're the one who started it!
Don't say that!
Ready? One... two...
Really... what are we doing?
Nanoka
Here.
Let's come again!
Sure.
Every year, when it's spring.
Yeah.
It's a promise!
Yeah.
I'm going home then.
Do you want to take a bath at my place first?
I'm fine like this.
I see...
Bye!
Ah!
Ah, no... It's nothing.
What?
It's nothing.
Later.
I love you.
I love you!
yasashii yume ga a gentle dream
sotto mune no haru wo yobi calls the spring in my heart
yasashii kaze ni nari and becomes a gentle breeze
kimi ni furete satteyuku that touches you then leaves
chiisana potto ni wa in the small pot
daisukina kimochi are feelings of love
yurayura to swaying softly
ii kaori nosete that carry a sweet scent
itsumo matteita always waiting...
kono toki wo atatamete warming up this moment...
futari dakara wakaru koto things we understand because it's the two of us
kotoba janakute are not just words
hohoemu dake negaudake we just smile, we just hope
shizukana sora e to the quiet sky
ashita mo mata aeru yo ne we'll see each other again tomorrow...
shizukana sora de at the quiet sky
