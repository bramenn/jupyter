It appeared as though humanity would be destroyed by the demons.
But a single mage saved them all.
He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
The Royal Capital of the Clover Kingdom
Time passed, and the title of Wizard King has been passed down to the present day,
where the Wizard King still protects this kingdom
along with his Magic Knights.
The Magic Knights have a total of nine squads under the Wizard King.
They are squads of mages trained in combat.
The band of heroes who risk their lives to protect the kingdom,
the Wizard King and the Magic Knights,
are what all citizens of the Clover Kingdom aspire to be.

Two thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight... Two thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine...
Three thousand!
Training!
I'm going to train... and train some more!
And I'm going to get stronger and stronger!
So I can become
the Wizard King before him!
I'm going to become the Wizard King
and go back for Sister Lily!
Sister!
Please marry me!
Who would've thought that even Asta would do so well as a Magic Knight?
I guess it pays to live long.
Fifteen years ago, Asta and Yuno were abandoned in front of our church, and now...
How they've grown!
Because of the money they send us monthly,
we were able to fix our roof,
and we won't be short on tatoes this winter!
Father...
I apologize.
Thank you.
It's all yours.
Really? Okay.
Magic is everything in this world.
Asta and Yuno that day...
We've never had a Wizard King from this area,
nor anyone who's actually achieved greatness in the Magic Knights.
I sincerely hope that one of you will become the Wizard King someday.
Ahem.
Now it's time
for the awarding... of the grimoires!
This is my grimoire?
Yuno received the legendary grimoire with the four-leaf clover.
I'm going to become the Wizard King.
However, Asta, who had no magic...
Um...
My grimoire's not coming.
Now to down some moguro leaf juice that I haven't had in a while, since it
supposedly increase magical powers!
Yeah!
What the heck?!
That's actually amazing!
That's way too funny!
What is that grimoire?
That sword!
Just who are you?!
You little wretch with no magical powers!
He... nullified my magic?
Even without magical powers...
I'm going to become the Wizard King!
Not giving up...
is my magic!
Look! Look!
My very own grimoire!
I don't even know how, but I was able to get one!
Everything turned out all right.
Yuno, Asta... You're the pride of this village.
There, there...
My Observation Diary of My Very Best Friend, Asta
The first time I encountered Asta was at the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.
He shone from the moment I laid eyes on him.
One of us is going to become the Wizard King. Our legend's beginning now, Yuno!
I'm gonna show you just how much I've grown in six months...
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
What the heck are these birds?!
What's with that kid?
Talk about a loser!
That's pretty bad, even for someone from the boonies.
Get away from me, you stupid birds!
That's...
All right. The next exam shall be the last one.
You will engage in actual combat.
Fighting is our duty. Show us your true abilities!
I have to stand out by fighting someone who looks strong.
Bah-ha! Fight me, Asta.
Sekke! You're willing to fight a loser like me?
Let's both give it our all and fight fair, so we can achieve our goals!
Begin!
No holding back, all right?
Let's do this, Asta! Bah-ha!
Bronze Creation Magic: Sekke Magnum Cannonball!
There's no need to hold back. Come at me! Bah-ha!
Sure thing.
Here I go.
I'm not joining
the Magic Knights so I can have a good time and avoid working hard.
I'm here to work my butt off and become the Wizard King!
So cool.
So cool.
S-So much pressure!
This is...
the magical power of a Magic Knights Squad captain?
You said earlier that you wanted to become the Wizard King, didn't you?
Now that I'm standing before you, do you still have the nerve
to say that you're going to be the Wizard King,
even without any magical powers?
E-Even if I can't join the Magic Knights today...
No matter how many times I fall,
no matter what anyone says to me,
I'm still going to become the Wizard King someday!
You're funny, kid.
Join my squad.
Huh?
I'm telling you that I'll let you join the Black Bulls.
I wasn't the only one who had realized Asta's brilliance. The captain had, too.
That's how Asta became a member of the Black Bulls.
And as for Asta's childhood friend, Yuno...
All who wish to offer, please raise your hand.
What?
Seriously?
All of the captains...
Th-That's amazing.
I-I thought that only royalty and nobles could join the Golden Dawn.
All of them! That's amazing!
I'll take the best path to becoming the Wizard King.
Please allow me to join the Golden Dawn.
Being Asta's childhood friend
would also make him Asta's best friend's childhood friend.
That would mean Yuno and I are also best friends.
My Observation Diary of My Very Best Friend's Best Friend, Yuno
Now, then...
I guess I'll write my entry for today.
My dearest friend Asta was working hard again today.
Scrubbing the floors...
Cleaning...
Doing laundry.
B-But my heart belongs to Sister Lily.
Next!
Taking care of the beasts.
Sit!
There, there. Good boy.
Here.
What the heck are you doing, you jerk?!
Let go of me!
It's hot!
This kind of heat is nothing to a member of the Black Bulls!
What? You're getting out already?
N-No, not yet! I'm not done yet!
It's hot. I want to add cold water. But...
Hanging out naked really is great.
Ugh, he's so stupid.
Don't you agree, Nero?
He's so reckless.
He's been like that ever since our first mission.
When we had to hunt that wild boar.
And when we finally got to Saussy Village, we ended up running into those weirdos.
Hey!
Yes, sir?
This is your execution.
I won't forgive this!
Do you think you can protect those beasts now?
Asta!
Too slow!
You have no chance of winning. Why won't you give up?
If I give up, who's going to protect them?
I've realized something.
It's not just because of our promise.
I'm going to become the Wizard King
so I can protect everyone!
Wizard King, my butt!
What does he think would've happened to him if I wasn't there?
Well, I mean, I guess there have been times where I thought he
may have actually done a good job.
Wait, no! That's not what I meant!
Why would I care about that shrimpy little peasant?
I'm a royal!
He's so stupid.
Even in the dungeon...
Your opponent...
is me!
How's that?
Disappear!
What are you doing, Stupidsta?
Noelle...
Hurry up and
defeat that guy, Asta!
Yeah, leave it to me.
I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!
Move. I'm going to make that girl, that weakling, disappear!
Like hell I'll let that happen!
I don't have any magic,
but I've got...
my friends!
I don't really get it, but I did it!
I messed up...
Asta...
Asta!
I mean, at least he was okay, but...
You saved me. Thanks.
I'm so sorry!
Thanks, Asta. I feel so much better!
Nah. Sorry for ruining the mixer.
It's fine.
Hey, Asta... D-Do you have anyone that you like?
Yup! There's somebody I've got my heart set on!
If you've got your heart set on me, don't make me worry so much.
Who are you worried about?
S-S-S-S-S-Stupidsta! How long have you been standing there?
I just got back from training!
What are you up to, Noelle?
Hmph.
Huh?
Why?!
Hmph!
Tonight's mission will be a bit rough.
I'll do my best!
Is your body back in tip-top shape, Yuno?
If your wounds still haven't healed
I'm fine.
You're so kind, Klaus.
Nonsense!
Bringing along someone who's wounded would slow us down.
It's not as though I'm actually worried about Yuno!
Let's go.
You're not getting on?
Huh? Um...
I was just thinking it'd be nice to ride on my broom tonight...
There's no reason to hold back.
It won't take that much more magic to carry you two.
Oh, I'm not holding back.
The thought of not wanting to be seen on that ship by anyone I know
never crossed my mind.
Not happening.
You bastards! You dare mock my ship?!
I didn't.
Hey! Hold it, Yuno!
You're not allowed to act without permission!
If you'll excuse me, too.
Huh?
I don't have any time to waste.
I need to become stronger.
Stronger...
But you're the one who gave me hope.
Even if you're poor, an orphan...
or even us...
We can become greater than anyone else in this world. And to prove that...
To make Sister and everyone else happy...
Let's see who can become the Wizard King!
Petit Clover!
It's Not as Though I'm Actually Worried
It's Not as Though I'm Actually Worried.
Yes, he's brushing each tooth carefully, with short strokes, ten to twenty times.
You mustn't scrub so roughly!
The bubbles are heading toward his eye!
Safe!
He's not kicking off his blanket and getting too cold, is he?
You're so kind, it's almost creepy, Klaus.
Not happening...
We're off work today?
I feel like all we ever do lately is take time off.
I'm going to play with Rebecca's younger siblings, then!

All right! I'm going to play with all I've got!
