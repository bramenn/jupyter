Edolas...?
Yes, Edolas... A different world than this one.
Over there, the world has begun losing its magic.
Losing magic?
Say what?
What's that mean?
Unlike this world, in Edolas, magic is limited.
If people use too much of it, it'll eventually vanish from the world.
When resources began to dry up, Edolas's king made a decision to save their magic...
He invented a magic spell that would absorb magic from another world, namely this one.
Yes... It's the Hyperspace Magic, Anima.
It's what that hole in the sky was.
That's... Anima?
Anima?!
No, it'll be dangerous to come with me.
Edolas.
The plan started 6 years ago,
and Anima were opened at various places around this world,
but it didn't produce the results they expected.
Someone was going around and closing the Anima...
When I heard the story from Wendy about Jellal, I mean Mystogan,
I didn't think it was possible, but...
I'm sure of it now. It was him.
But the Anima this time was simply too large for anyone to defend against it,
and the guild was absorbed.
Why did they suck up Fairy Tail?
Didn't I tell you?
This is all for Edolas's magical power.
There are a ton of powerful wizards at Fairy Tail!
Is that why it was targeted?
Yes.
Man, how selfish can you get?
Give everyone back, you jerk!
Damn it...
So this... is Carla's and my fault?
Indirectly, yes.
Indirectly?
We were sent to this world from the Kingdom of Edolas with a separate mission.
That can't be!
You were born from an egg... In this world!
So was Happy! I found him!
True.
Just so you know, I've never set foot in Edolas.
Like Wendy said, I was born and raised in this world.
But knowledge of Edolas and our mission was ingrained in us.
We should have known it all from the moment we were born.
And yet...
Why don't you know anything?
So that's that.
We're from Edolas, and what happened here is our fault.
You said something about a separate mission, Carla?
I can't say.
Please tell me, Carla! I want to know what I am!
I told you, I can't say! You have to remember yourself!
Righto!
We've got everything settled, so let's go!
Off to this Edolas place!
Everything is hardly settled!
You don't understand at all...
Natsu-san...
Natsu... I...
All this unease is making me hungry.
That just proves you're alive!
Everyone's in Edolas, right? In that case, we gotta go save'em!
What about that, Carla?
They might be there...
But I don't know if we could save them.
I don't even know if we could return from Edolas...
Well, as long as my friends aren't here, I don't need to come back.
Everyone except for Igneel, anyway...
I agree.
Can we really save everyone?
I guess I'm basically a member of Fairy Tail too...
And I do feel somewhat responsible about what my home Kingdom has done...
I guess I might take you there...
But you need to promise me a few things.
Returning to Edolas is a violation of my orders.
We can't be discovered by the people from the Kingdom.
Everyone has to be in disguise.
Me, too?
You sure about this, Carla?
Yes. I've made up my mind.
And you, he-cat... Don't ask me about our orders.
Aye...
And thirdly, I don't know anything other than basic info about Edolas.
I can't guide you.
Got it.
Roger that.
Finally...
If I or the he-cat do something to betray you, do not hesitate to kill us.
I wouldn't do something like that...
And would you shut that thing up!
Let's go.
He-cat, grab onto Natsu.
We're going to fly there?
Our wings...
Our wings are for returning to Edolas.
Let's go, Happy! To your home country!
Aye!
He-cat, open up your full magical power!
Aye, sir!
We can enter Edolas through the remaining traces of the Anima!
We'll cut through with our wings, Aera!
Now!
So bright...
This is... Edolas...
My roots...
The islands are floating.
This is your homeland, Happy.
This is Edolas.
It really is...
It's full of strange trees and plants!
Wow! Look at that, Happy!
A river is flowing in the sky!
How's it do that?
Come on, you people...
I know how you feel, but we didn't come here to sightsee.
Don't get so excited.
Yeah, you're right.
My bad...
My wings suddenly...
What happened?
I told you, remember?
You can't use magic freely here.
Oh, you're right!
I feel kind of strange...
Okay then!
Let's go search for everyone!
Natsu, where exactly should we be searching?
Leave it to me!
I can rely on my nose for something like...
Huh?
It's no use.
There's so many things I've never smelled before, I can't tell what's what.
You're right.
The air tastes a little different, too...
Does that mean fire'll taste different, too?
Don't ask me, thank you.
And I'm hungry!
We should have packed lunches...
Is this any time to be relaxed, people?!
Anyway, where are we walking toward?
Who knows...
For now we'll walk, and we'll get somewhere eventually.
That's not going to solve anything.
We don't have any other way.
It can't be helped.
Now look here, you!
That was me, actually.
Anyway, there's no one here...
It's just one big forest.
Even so, we need to get in disguises.
Sure, but how?
Hey...
Natsu...
I really don't think so...
This isn't a disguise, it's camouflage!
Whatever! What's important is that no one finds us, right?
Don't sweat it.
This is kind of embarrassing...
I can't say much for your fashion sense, but the idea has its merits.
Really?
I'm kind of hot...
These leaves are stuffy.
You're pitiful.
Deal with it.
Aye...
It's that weird river from before!
I can't believe that a river is flowing into the sky!
Oh, right! I was hungry!
I said, deal with it!
I bet that river is filled with yummy fish...
Look, over there!
It looks like an Edolas human.
Phew... He looks like us.
What did you imagine they'd look like?
And he's fishing, of all things!
I'm jealous...
By the way, where's Natsu-san?
Yo!
Got a sec?!
Natsu-san...
What are you doing?!
Yeah, that's definitely scary...
I'm searching for this guild named Fairy Tail.
Have you seen them around somewhere?
Hey, wait!
What's wrong with him?
I just asked a little question...
What were you thinking?
You're wearing a weird outfit, then ask about Fairy Tail?
How's he supposed to know what that means?
How else are we gonna find out where everyone is?
Well, in that case...
If that man goes and reports to the Kingdom...
This camouflage is pointless, isn't it?
Anyway, we have to hurry and find everyone.
Phew, finally cooled off.
Too bad that person didn't leave his fishing rod behind...
Did I do something?
Anyway, that's a strange sound...
Another fisherman?
All right! This time, I'll...
You just don't learn, do you?
Look, it's a fish!
All right!
We'll catch it and have a meal...
It's huge!
Looks delicious!
And huge!
Ooh, a big, strong fella!
I'm gettin' fired up!
But Natsu-san... We have to get going before...
I'll only need 3 seconds.
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
Huh?
Natsu-san!
Huh?
My fire don't work...
I told you, remember?
You can't use magic freely in Edolas!
Which means...
We run!
It's still chasing us!
Not being able to use magic is gonna be a real pain, isn't it?
It's a little late to realize that now, Natsu!
Anyway, middle of the forest or not,
isn't making such a big scene gonna get us in trouble?
Tell that to the giant catfish!
Oh, crap!
It's a dead-end!
Happy, fly me!
I can't use magic, remember?
Dang!
This is what happens when we can't use magic?!
Is everyone okay?
I'm hungry, but otherwise still alive.
Give it a rest already, okay?
We're not in disguise, so don't cause any more commotion!
Carla...
My fault? Really?
Not entirely, but for the most part!
I don't know what the Kingdom would do if they found out we're here.
In that case, I couldn't predict what would happen to us,
let alone whether we'd be able to save everyone!
I-I see...
I don't really understand, but it's my fault, I guess...
What don't you understand about it?
Carla, you're going too far.
Natsu-san didn't mean to do any harm.
If he meant it, that'd make it even worse!
Stuff happens in life, you know, Natsu?
That's not cheering me up, Happy.
Plus, this isn't a time for your stomach to be growling.
We got spotted again.
What'll we do?
Um...
We are travelers who have lost our way!
Please forgive us!
Oh great Exceed, please spare our lives!
Exceed?
I wonder who they're talking about?
Um...
Don't, Natsu!
We can't exactly fix things up now, right?
Uh, we have something we'd like to ask you!
Our friends are here in Edolas, and...
Save us!
Oh, for cryin' out loud...
When those people saw Carla and Happy, it seemed like they were frightened...
See? It wasn't my fault.
Was I making that scary a face?
Maybe they thought you'd eat them!
Aw, I'm not that hungry.
What is it now?
I have a bad feeling about this.
We fell again...
Sheesh...
Where are we?
It looks like a storehouse of some kind...
I don't know how much good it'll do now,
but let's borrow some clothes for disguises from here.
There's tons of fun clothes!
Natsu-san, don't look over here, okay?
Take a look at me!
I guess this'll do.
How cute!
You look good in anything, Carla.
What is it?
It's Fairy Tail!
The building's a little different, but it's Fairy Tail!
It's gotta be!
Natsu-san!
Wait!
Sheesh...
This helmet is heavy...
Everyone's safe!
We found everyone pretty easily!
The guild seems really different, though.
Don't worry about the details, man!
Can we really, though?
Wait... This isn't right...
Hey, that's the Request Board...
There's nothing weird at all, see?
So why are we sneaking around like this?
Look carefully.
That's...
Juvia is going on a job now.
Be careful, now.
W-Wait, Juvia-chan!
I wish you'd take me with you... or something...
You're so smothering...
How many layers do you have on?
Strip down a little and call me again sometime.
But I get chilled easily!
Gray's way too clingy.
Men in love sure get fired up.
What the heck?!
That's pitiful, Elfman.
You screwed up on a job, again?
I'm so embarrassed...
Who do you think's gonna pick up the slack?
Hey, look! The two vying for the strongest in Fairy Tail,
I'm sorry..
Don't just apologize!
Jet and Droy, are lecturing Elfman again.
Hope they go easy on him...
Work, work!
Nab works way too much.
You can say that again.
Cana-san, why don't you have a drink with us for a change?
Come over here!
I know I have spoken of this before to you.
I cannot handle drinking alcohol.
Bis Bis...
What is it, Al Al...
Now look here, you...
But... But!
Don't cry at every little thing!
I love Juvia-chan!
Shut up, Gray!
And slim down a little!
W-What's going on here?
Everyone's acting really weird!
Hey.
Who the hell are you?
No way...
It's...
What the hell are you doing sneaking around under there?
Lucy!
What in the world is happening?
What's this?
Everyone's personality has gone funky!
Maybe it's the effect of Edolas.
It's like everyone's personalities are reversed!
Gray wears too much clothing, Elfman's a crybaby, and Levy's a bad-girl!
This is hilarious!
If everyone's personality is backwards, what will Erza be like, I wonder?
Next time: Fairy Hunting.
The opposite of brutal, violent Erza would be...
I dunno, what?
