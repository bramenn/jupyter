Finally, I've become super famous, too! Just kidding!
Actually, a fake Sailor Moon suddenly appeared
and started being a great hero!
But I had no idea this was our enemy's trap!
Tuxedo Mask, watch out!
Okay, then! This is when the real Sailor Moon
has to do something in the name of the moon!
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward, I can say it in my dreams
My thoughts are about to short circuit, I want to see you right now
Moonlight that makes me want to cry, midnight that keeps me from calling
Because I'm so innocent, what should I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope
Guided by the light of the moon
We will meet again and again
I count the sparkle of constellations to foretell the future of my love
We were born in the same land, miracle romance
I believe in it, miracle romance
I'm Usagi Tsukino.
As you know, I'm a sailor warrior of love and justice, Sailor Moon.
But it's not easy, you know.
I have to get a hold of the legendary Silver Crystal
before the bad guys get it,
but to do that, I have to find the seven rainbow crystals!
Oh, man. But anyhow, we've got four sailor warriors now,
so it'll work out somehow.
The Last Sailor Warrior, Sailor Venus Appears
Prepare yourself, Sailor Moon!
I am your opponent, Nephrite!
Tuxedo Mask!
Stop this!
Zoisite, what is the meaning of this?
I do not wish to see such scenes again!
Queen Beryl, these are actually all scenes showing Sailor Moon
when she was rescued at the last minute.
Are you talking about Tuxedo Mask? Just who is he?
Unfortunately, we do not know.
However Queen Beryl,
he has appeared virtually every time Sailor Moon has been in danger.
If we make use of this,
we should be able to lure Tuxedo Mask out into the open.
So, you are saying that you will take back
the two rainbow crystals he stole?
Zoisite, I hope you know this is your final chance.
Yes, my lady. I am very aware of it.
Wait, Zoisite!
Oh, Master Kunzite!
If you want to lure Tuxedo Mask out,
you will first need a plan to draw
the sailor warriors away from Tuxedo Mask.
Queen Beryl, I would like to have the honor of accomplishing that.
Very well.
Bring all seven rainbow crystals before me.
Yes, my lady.
Master Kunzite, I will do this for you and not for anyone else.
I will even die for you.

Hands in the air! And hand over the money!
Hurry up!
Ouch!
Who the hell are you?!

And now for some news.
The sailor warrior, Sailor Moon,
whose actions have been the talk of the town lately,
arrested a bank robber.
Today, around 2 o'clock in the afternoon,
the robber forced his way into Touzai Bank, Juban Branch,
Touzai Bank Automatic the robber forced his way into Touzai Bank, Juban Branch,
the robber forced his way into Touzai Bank, Juban Branch,
and demanded money from the female tellers while firing his rifle.
Usagi?! No way!
This is it! This is it!
I'm so happy!
This is the right way for a middle school girl to spend her holiday!
Usagi, if you eat too much, you'll gain weight!
But I just can't stop!
Oh, no!
Help!
It's Sailor Moon!
So, she's the Sailor Moon everyone's talking about!
Wow! She's so cool!
Good job!
Thanks!
She didn't cut the rope on purpose, did she?
Sailor Moon...
Why?! Why was Sailor Moon there?!
What about me?!
Calm down, Usagi.
Anyway, let's contact Luna and everyone else and follow her.
Okay.
Only the sailor warriors and Tuxedo Mask will be able to follow her.
Hurry up and come. I am waiting for you, Tuxedo Mask!
Refrigerated Warehouse
She should be somewhere in this direction. I've lost sight of her.
Who would have expected that a fake Sailor Moon would show up?
I know.
I saw the news on that bank robbery, too.
Of course, I didn't think that was Usagi.
We would have nothing to complain about
if the real Sailor Moon was as hard working as her.
You're so mean!
The question is, what is the fake Sailor Moon's goal?
Is she our enemy or our ally?
An ally...
Luna, could she possibly be the fifth sailor warrior?
What? No, uh...
There's just something fishy about this!
Besides, how dare she use the name of Sailor Moon
without my permission?!
I gotta catch her, and make her pay license fees!
Oh, no!
That is not the problem here!
Let's go, everyone!
Okay!
That guy is one of the Dark Kingdom's...
Oh, no! We need to rescue her!
Wait!
It's dangerous. This could be a trap!
Even if it is a trap,
I just can't watch Sailor Moon being treated like that!
I agree.
Everyone, transform!
Moon Prism Power Makeup!
Mercury Power Makeup!
Mars Power Makeup!
Jupiter Power Makeup!
What annoying and wasteful lights.
The only true beauty is the radiant darkness.
The darkness of the Dark Kingdom will shade the entire world.
I cannot wait to see it.
Not so fast!
You have terrible taste, tying up a girl and hanging her!
I'm the sailor warrior of love and justice,
Sailor Moon!
Likewise, Sailor Mercury!
Likewise, Sailor Mars!
And I'm Sailor Jupiter!
In the name of the moon, I will severely punish you!
So, you are here.
I am Kunzite, one of the Great Four of the Dark Kingdom!
Sailor Moon and sailor warriors, prepare yourselves!
What?!
How do you like this beautiful darkness?!
It's quite impressive.
Fire
Soul!
Sailor Mars, you good-for-nothing!
He's tough!
What's wrong?
Supreme
Thunder!
The power is being sucked into the darkness!
Is that the extent of the sailor warriors' powers?
Sailor Moon!
Is this a trap?
Shoot!
What are you doing, Sailor Moon?!
Zoisite!
You poor thing.
I will soon put you out of your misery, Tuxedo Mask.
Zoi!
Running will do you no good.
I will take the rainbow crystals this time for certain.
Zoi!
Oh, no! We're trapped!
Let me try something!
Supreme
Thunder!
It's no use! The power is being sucked away by the barrier!
Give it up! You will never break this barrier!
Here, here, here, here!
I've found you.
Die!
Zoi!
Oh, this man is...
My, you look handsome unmasked.
But I won't let you get away.
Prepare to die!
Crescent Beam!
It hurts! Ouch!
Who are you?!
Shoot!
How dare you make a fool of me?!
I don't care who you are! I'll tear you to shreds! This isn't fair!
I can't breathe.
The air...
How do you like the taste of my darkness?
Master Kunzite, please be careful.
In addition to Tuxedo Mask, there is another enemy nearby.
Zoisite, did you fail to capture Tuxedo Mask?
Such cold words! I was just about to take care of that.
Tuxedo Mask! Look!
This is the end of Sailor Moon and her friends!
What? Tuxedo Mask?
If you want to save them, come out with the rainbow crystals!
Surrender yourself, Tuxedo Mask!
Tuxedo Mask, don't come out!
I can't hold on anymore...
Sailor Moon!
Wait!
We did it, Master Kunzite!
That's right! In the end, there is no way for you to win!
Struggling will only bring you more suffering!
It's important to know when to give up.
No! You're wrong!
No matter how hard it is, you must never give up!
It's the same voice again!
Oh, that voice is...
Who are you?!
Sailor warrior, Sailor Venus!
If you will pardon me, I have arrived!
Crescent Beam!
Master Kunzite!
The barrier is gone!
Sailor V! You're Sailor V, aren't you?!
What?
Sailor...
She is the warrior of justice, Sailor V!
And her true identity is...
Sailor warrior,
Sailor Venus!!
Luna, long time no see.
Artemis!
Damn it!
Master Kunzite, please run! I will take care of them!
Wait, Zoisite, Kunzite!
Queen Beryl!
That is enough! The situation has changed! Come back now!
Why?
Quiet! I am telling you to pull out!
We have no choice.
But Master Kunzite...
Sailor warriors, we shall finish this battle another time!
Tuxedo Mask!
He's gone!
Anyway, looks like we're safe now.
Now, we have five warriors and two cats.
Everyone is together now.
Sailor V, no, Sailor Venus...
Oh, by any chance, are you the princess from the moon?
During the day, the fragrance of flowers
During the night, the twinkle of the stars
It's a world no one knows about
With white shoes clicking
Cross the white moon bridge
And there lives a princess, dreaming of a sweet kiss
Offer a prayer to the moon
It will surely bring you happiness
Go round and round, the moon's merry-go-round
Make that serene dress made of glass flutter in the wind
She's always watching over us
Moon, moon princess
