Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Such a narrow sky.
What is that?
The sky is glowing.
It crashed!
It ran into the Soul Shield Membrane and stopped!
To crash there and not be destroyed
Could it be a body of spiritual power of such great concentration?
If we are separated, we will be blown apart by the shock!
Wha-!
Grab onto whoever is nearest to you!
Don't let go, no matter what!
Damn it!
What do you mean by that?!
Let me sit on your shoulder.
Yoruichi!
Ishida!
Chad?!
Chad?!
Chad!
Chad!
C-Chad!
Damn it!
Ichigo!
Inoue!
Damn! They split up into four!
The strongest one
Which one is it?!
Hold on to me, Ishida!
Hinagiku! Baigon! Lily!
Santen Kesshun! I reject!”
Whats your problem?!
Shut up! Stay back!
Turn to sand! Seppa!
Thanks to your weird skill, we are saved
Howd the sand get in there?
Your skill did this! Quit coughing!
Hey!
You got a lot of nerve, punching the guy who saved your life!
Who said that?! I only said we were saved-!
Yahoo! What luck!
We skipped out on the tiresome guard duty,
but you fall right into our hands!
Lucky, Im lucky! Today, Im lucky!
You, on the other hand, are not.
Huh?
This holes huge.
How is this possible?!
N-No body. That means hes still alive!
Find him!
Right!
Now What do I do?
Its coming!
Get ready!
Wha-? It disappeared
Damn. Find them!
So now Im all alone
But it might be better this way.
Uh-uh. No good Ichigo
No Not Poo-san, its Pee-tan!
They sound alike, but theyre different
Ms. Inoue?
No, Ichigo!
Ms. Inoue!
Oh Ichigo!
Ouch.
Ow!
Oh? Ishida
Are you all right, Ms. Inoue?
Oh Thats right
It appears we were able to land, luckily, in an unpopulated area.
Huh? How lucky! Owww!
Oh! Careful!
You were injured in the fall.
I administered first-aid with the bandages I had,
but I didnt have any painkillers
S-So you did. Thank you
You keep bandages on hand?
Uhoh, Im fine!
Im sorry. You were shielding me
If it werent for me, you would never have gotten hurt.
You think so?
Im such a klutz, I wouldve gotten hurt, anyway.
And if you werent there with the first-aid kit,
I wouldve bled, become anemic and wouldnt be able to move.
Does that sound weird?
No Lets just get going.
That was a pretty loud landing.
A crowd will be gathering soon.
Right
Luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck
Lucky!
Luck, luck, luck Lucky!
Luck, luck, luck, luck...
Lucky-y!
Whatre you doing, fools?!
I was doing my Lucky Dance” for you
while waiting for you to come crawling out!
Whatre you gaping like idiots at?!
Don't you understand human kindness?!
What's with him?
Hey!
Huh?
What is it?
Im gonna run first chance I get.
Courtesy is the basis
Youre gonna run? What're you thinking?!
of the Samurai Code!
Fool! Cant you see?!
They have way greater spiritual powers
than ordinary Soul Reapers!
Whats this arguing about?!
Hmphmaybe theyre scared out of their wits to fight us.
Well, let them take their time and argue.
But if they take too long,
other guys will come and steal our glory.
Yeah, thats true.
Fine! Ill set a time limit! So kind!
Ill do another dance
Anyhow, I'm gonna run!
so you two can do what you want.
If you wanna fight, be my guest!
Huh?
A disagreement?
Something like that.
Crap. Dont give us trouble. Yumichika!
Right!
As I expected, one of them is after me! Damn!
Yo!
Huh?
Tell me Why didnt you run?
The other guy ran because he saw that our strength was greater than his, right?
I think he made the right decision.
If your strength is greater than mine, its useless to run.
Youd catch me for sure.
Butif my strength is greater
Ill just defeat you and be on my way.
Thats all.
I seeI guess youre not stupid, after all.
He dodged it!
Moves well!
With the sheath?!
At leasttell me your name.
Ichigo Kurosaki.
Ichigo? Thats a good name.
Think so? No one ever praised it before.
Yeah. Guys with ichi” in their names are full of talent and good looks.
Im 3rd-Seat Assistant Adjutant, Squad 11. Ikkaku Madarame!
My fellow ichi,” lets be friends!
No way!
Dammit! Hes persistent! Wont he ever stop?!
Humph What ugly running.
Up ahead.
Turn into sand! Seppa!
Hmm! What an unusual skill!
Thats how you made that earlier crater?
But if youre not careful
Seppa!
Up ahead, theres
W-Whats this?!
This is dangerous!
This is the old execution ground.
We brought captive Hollows and threw them down here to fight criminals.
We would watch from up there.
Soul Reapers do crude things, dont they?
Not as crude as your face.
Pity you.
Pretty”? Even you recognize my dazzling handsomeness, dont you?
Not pretty”! I said, Pity”!
I know that! I made a witty, humorous joke!
Besides, that crude” practice no longer exists.
Only, those who fall in can never get out.
That should be enough chasing around and prattle for now.
Its time. Ill let you choose.
Will you dieby my sword?
Or will you fall in that holeand die?
Which will you choose?
Oops
If youre angry, turn and let me see your face.
No matter how it looks
I love that look of agony when one must choose how to die.
Youre a crude bastard, after all, arent you?
I dont get it.
Hm?
Sure, we got a distance between us,
but only a greenhorn would let one hand leave his sword during a match!
S-Shut up!
I cant see with the blood in my eyes! I only wiped it!
On the forehead, even a shallow wound bleeds profusely
Unless you stop the bleeding,
its useless to wipe it.
Hey! Thats dirty!
You have a styptic to stop the bleeding!
Its not dirty! Its brains! Brains!
You should admire me for being experienced!
Yeah?
You sure are a strange guy You behave like a greenhorn.
And you dont look much like a fighter.
But
You have excellent reflexes!
And fierce attack!
You could even say your movements are coming close to mine!
Dont look so angry.
Im praising you.
Youre too good to be dismissed as a mere greenhorn with natural abilities
Who was your teacher, Ichigo?
It was only for ten days, so I dont know if I can call him Teacher,”
but there is a man who taught me how to fight.
Who?
KisukeUrahara.
I see
He was your teacher
In that case, it would be rude to kill you without giving my all.
Lengthen! Hozuki-maru!
A spear?!
No time to look surprised, Ichigo! Im coming at ya!
Dont misread this!
Not me!
Heh! A spears reach is long. I know that much! I wont misread it!
Wrong!
An opening!
Split apart! Hozuki-maru!
Nowlook this way.
Show me your expression in your last moment of life.
Each time I see such things, my beauty grows even keener.
Get beautiful without my help!
You wretch!
Turn into sand! Seppa!
What are you doing?! To beautiful me!
Oh, no! Im falling, falling!
Falling!
Disgraceful. Talk about digging your own grave.
I guess some actually do it.
How trifling.
Huh?!
Gotcha.
A strange trick!
What is that orb?!
Heh Good thing I brought a spare
This is a Cannonball developed by Shiba Kukaku,
the best sis in the world.
Not even a Zanpaku-to can easily shatter it.
Oh, my. How he underestimates me
I am 5th Seat of Squad 11, the strongest Squad.
Dont think Im any ordinary Soul Reaper!
Bloom! Fuji Kujaku!
Ill break that spiritual partition with a single blow!
Oh yeah I forgot to tell you, this bomb of my Siss
Once its concentration of spiritual power is broken, it quickly
You sneaky!
Clever strategy, wasnt it?
Still
You are a tough bastard!
Dont tell me you thought that was enough to kill me off.
Now Im really mad! Youll pay!
Cant hear you.
Seppa!
Running again?!
Kiss my butt.
Ugly Too ugly!
I warned you not to misread it.
Hozuki-maru isnt a spear. Its a sansetsukon.”
Does it hurt? That hand probably cant hold a sword anymore.
Im a kind-hearted guy.
Ordinarilly, I wouldve taken you in alive.
Sorry, though. I get no recognition unless I kill you.
Fine!
Whatre you doing?
Lets go!
Dont talk as if its over. I still havent shown you my skill.
It starts now, Ikkaku.
Fine words. Greenhorn!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll alway stay close to you
Now and forever
Youre pretty good, Ichigo. But the real battle starts now.
Its too late to come crying with apologies!
Thats my line! Fight!
Hit it, Cover it, Rock Scissors Paper!
Not that kind of battle!
