Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watching Fairy Tail keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen, okay?
The Kingdom of Fiore.
A world where magic is an integral part of people's lives.
However...
What we will be presenting to you today is a very eerie magic...
For the next 30 minutes your mind will leave your body and head deep into this magic...
That's right, we can do it!
Let's go for even more who-knows-what!!
The door to mystery is right in front of us
The whole world's a wonderland
which we're already wondering!!!
This excitement gets my heart racing
It's wonderful!
Who am I, I wonder?
What is real, I wonder?
Why can't I see tomorrow, I wonder?
The only part leveling up is my curiosity
We can't just throw away our daily life together, right?
Tell me! S. O. W.
Living itself will be our training!
So, we can make it!
Let's search for even more who-knows-what!
We can't be satisfied with just the normal answers
This magical wonder life
Our future is wondering!!!
We'll do our best living our life
the way we want to!
Let's wondering!!!
Is the master in?
Did you have a little swim in the ocean?
It wasn't that kind of trip.
Whoa, Mira-san... Now is not the time...
Where is the master?!
He had some kind of council something-or-other meeting, or whatever...
He's been gone since yesterday.
We're safe for now!
All right! None of that until gramps gets back!
Thank goodness! We can put off staring into the gates of hell for a while longer!
Tell me what that is already!
I wanna know so bad! It's freaking me out!
It's even scarier when I don't know what it is!
Be quiet!
When will the master return?
It shouldn't be long now.
When the master returns, I will immediately ask for his decision.
Going on an S class quest without permission is against the rules, period.
Be prepared for the consequences.
And what consequences should I be prepared for, exactly?!
Well, too bad for you!
Although... It's one thing for Natsu and Gray to experience that, but for Lucy-chan it's just...
You poor thing!
Poor thing?
Hey, you jerk! Whaddaya mean, It's one thing for? Huh, Wakaba?
Yeah! Don't lump me in with Natsu!
And what do you mean by that, huh?
Exactly what I said!
You just don't take a hint, do you?
A man takes responsibility for his actions.
You're men, right? Then show it.
That's mean! Why wasn't I put into the it's one thing for list?
And what is this experience anyway?!
Changeling!
There's a strange-looking request.
Hey, Loke.
Hmm, these characters are...
What is it?
You're back too, Lucy?!
Well, yeah! Of course! I went with Natsu after all.
Why are you so scared of me?
Uh, well, bye!
All of you!
This is not the time or place!
Weak...
Sheesh, it's noisy.
Wizards are awesome, totally.
Are you kiddin' me?
Please figure out what this writing means.
If you figure it out, I will present you with 500,000 jewel.
Whoa, awesome! It says its 500,000 jewel!
Aye!
Figure out the meaning of some writing?
That's a rare kind of request.
Wait, isn't this ancient writing?
Who the heck could read that?
But there's a transliteration next to it into modern characters.
I said stop this, now!
Oh! I can read that!
Let's see here...
Uugo deru rasuchi borokania
I don't get this at all!
What's this?
So, some people get so terrified of punishment they'll sprout rainbows?
I don't think that's it...
Groggy...
I'm cold!
Why's an ice-user cold?
What the heck? My whole body is way too cold!
Something's... friggin' heavy!
My chest area is like really, really heavy!
My back is killing me...
What's the matter, Lucy?
You're speaking way lower than usual...
That's not...
Oh? Why was I on the ground?
And wait... Why am I standing?
Hey, Natsu! Why did you run away when you saw my face?
What's with my voice?
T-They're acting different than normal...
What in the world is all this ruckus?
Natsu, check it out! Wait, who's Natsu?
Huh? What?
And man, why's it so dark in here?
I've got two neato boobs stuck to my chest!
Look, look!
Cease that!
That didn't hurt much.
What is the reason for this cat form?
Wait... I truly am a cat!
I don't remember requiping this!
Sheesh, I can't drink in peace.
Magic is so cool, totally!
You're kidding me...
What in the world is going on?
It's so damn cold!
And why is there someone here that looks just like me?
Huh? What are you talkin' about?
Haven't you realized yet?
Our minds and bodies have... switched places!
What do you mean, Happy?
I am Erza!
I'm Happy! You're so mean, Loke...
Be quiet!
Which means...
Natsu and Loke...
Gray and Lucy...
And worst of all, Happy and I have switched places!
What do you mean, worst of all?
Magical words of ancient Umpera-ese.
You have activated Changeling.
Master!
Gramps!
That request is the cause.
When you read that spell, the people nearby swap minds.
That is Changeling.
Changeling?
You're Natsu, right?
Yeah.
What the hell have you done?
Don't ask me!
All I did was try and read the request a little!
And would someone turn on the lights?!
Enough, Lucy!
I mean Gray.
It's not just your minds that swap...
Your magic swaps as well.
I'm hot...
It's like there's boiling magma in my stomach...
Hey, how about you and I go out for dinner sometime?
What the heck?!
And one last thing!
If you don't undo the spell within 30 minutes of activation...
You will never be able to return to normal.
Or so the legend goes.
How long has it been since then?
16 minutes.
So you have 14 minutes left.
Gramps! What's the spell to return us to normal?
Well, it is an ancient magic...
When it comes to something this old...
I have no clue!
And I was so looking forward to punishing you for going on that S class quest...
That's out of the question now!
Well! Give it your best shot.
What the hell?!
I'm gonna do it!
P-Please, don't do that!
Oh, I see. Since that's Gray in there, he still has his stripping fetish.
Hey, that's right!
Happy?
What are you...
This'll be fun! I wanna try!
Don't!
Requip, requip! Look at me requip!
Now that's something!
Stop that!
What has happened to my pride as an S class wizard?
Huh? This is strange... I wanted to show people some cool armor, but this...
I get it! It's true we've swapped techniques, but now we're all crappy at them!
Hey, Loke!
Er, wait! The dude that's inside'im.
Don't call me the dude inside him!
What?
What is your magic anyway?
Yeah, that's right.
What kind of magic is it? Show it to us.
I dunno...
I can't feel anything. Nothing's happening.
I just feel sort of hazy...
What is with this nervous feeling?!
Somebody do something!
What's with that fire?
Looks more like drool...
Yup, definitely quite crappy.
Oh, I see! So this is what it's like to fly!
Wait, this is no time to be impressed!
We don't have time to spare!
What in the world should we do?
Gray... I mean, Lucy... Ice is coming out of your mouth.
Eww! I hate this!
Lu-chan, leave this to me!
Levy-chan!
Levy!
With Team Shadow Gear here, we'll make sure to turn you back to normal!
Yeah! Don't sweat it.
So without further ado, do it, Levy!
In other words, Levy is going to handle it herself.
Thank you, Levy-chan!
I'll do my best for you, Lu-chan!
I want to be the first person to read your novel,'kay, Lu-chan?
What should we do?
I know a thing or two about ancient writing.
So first thing to do is examine the request carefully.
We don't have any time! Will you make it?
Anyway, let's trust this to Levy!
Why am I eating a fish?
They're delicious!
Um... Uugo deru...
Only 10 minutes to go!
And wait! You can read the words safely, Levy?
It's safe to read the ancient spell writing as long as it isn't read in order.
There's no time! Ah, everything's so hazy!
I couldn't stand being like this forever!
Well, I kind of like this.
One more time!
Requip!
I said stop it!
So, Levy-chan...
Have you figured anything out?
Not a thing!
I see... So from now on I'll exist as an odd winged cat?
I am not odd!
Please, stop it!
I'm so hazy...
Will I never be able to go out on a date again?
I wanna switch bodies, too!
Yeah, yeah, you're Macao's son all right.
Now calm down everyone! I'm still thinking!
Macao, the time!
Eight minutes to go.
Guess it's time to prepare for the worst.
This can't be happening!
Go, go, Levy!
So they're nothing but a cheering squad?
Deru, deru... Ah, that's it!
Then...
What'll we do if we stay like this forever?
What do you mean, what'll we do?
You intend to go out and do jobs like this?
Well if we don't turn back, what choice do we have?
I don't mind!
Since no one'll know if I don't talk.
That's not the problem!
You hair-brained cat!
Forever like this? Nooo!
Gray, er... Lucy! That's seriously gross, man.
You don't say!? It's not like ice is coming out of my mouth'cause I want it to!
What's the matter Gray... I mean, Lucy?
This is bad. All of our skills have gotten really crappy now.
Even if we go out on a job, we couldn't do it right!
Which means...
Right now...
We're...
The weakest team in all of Fairy Tail!
Let's go, Happy!
Aye!
Ice Make...
Something-or-other gate, I open thee!
Flying in the sky is a lot of fun!
Lame
Crap! When you put it that way, we're screwed!
Why couldn't I realize this basic fact earlier?
It must be because I've turned into a cat...
How cruel! Body-swapped Erza keeps insulting me!
What were you just trying to do, Erza? Or I mean, Happy?
She said something awful to me, so I wanted to say I'm out of here! and tried to fly away...
But I don't have wings... I don't have wings so I fell!
I-I am at fault!
I'm begging you, remove yourself-
I got it!
All right! You can undo the spell, right?
Hurry, Levy!
This ancient writing means With this eternal swapping, may you be forever happy.
All right! Great going, Levy-chan!
With this eternal swapping, may you be forever happy.
So...
I means that the people who have swapped bodies will live together in happiness for eternity!
Ah, I'm so glad I figured it out.
Forever
Wait, doesn't that mean we'll stay like this?!
So you only figured out what the request said, Levy?
You're right! What am I to do?
Levy-chan, we've got to undo the magic! There should be a way...
You know, like a hidden meaning or something! Try searching for that!
Okay, I'll do my best!
Go, Go, Levy!
Isn't that cheering squad making things worse?
No! Fighting spirit is crucial!
I'm going to join them!
Go, Go, Levy!
No... I can't see any extra meaning this way...
It's not even making words!
3 minutes left!
No!
Fish, from now on, every day...
Fish in the morning, fish at noon, fish at night...
Now that I'm a cat, is that what will be my happiness?
Calm down Happy! I mean Erza!
Erza, I apologize for before. I was wrong.
Happy, you...
We shouldn't be fighting now, right?
Let's make up.
Yes, you're right! I was wrong, too!
Aye! This is a make-up present!
A fish!
Get a clue!
Levy, nothing yet?
Oh we're in trouble now... We're at the one minute mark!
Why, you... You've been really damn amused by this!
T-That's not really...
Just a little more... I feel like I'm close...
You can do it! You can do it, Levy!
You're on fire!
He fits right in.
What, still going at it?
Gramps, don't you remember anything?
At this rate, we'll...
Master!
Nothing in particular.
We're not gonna make it!
I told you, anything but that!
I give up!
I'm not sure how accurate this is, but 40 seconds to go! Probably.
What do you mean, probably?!
I remembered something!
What is it?
When undoing this magic, I think you can only do it one pair at a time.
It's impossible to do everyone at once.
What?
30 seconds left!
About.
Which pair'll go first?
Me and Loke, of course! Right, Loke?
Exactly!
Not on my life! We'll be going first!
Wait! What'll happen to Fairy Tail if I stay like this?
Happy and I will go first!
I don't mind one way or the other.
I can't watch...
People are scary creatures when cornered...
Coming up on 15 seconds!
I got it!
12, 11...
Levy-chan!
It's like this! Let me explain!
9, 8...
Levy, save the explaining for later! Hurry!
Right!
Here I go!
Aruboroya tesura rugi gouu!
Aruboroya tesura rugi gouu!
Aruboroya tesura rugi gouu!
Aruboroya tesura rugi gouu!
I'm back to normal!
Me, too!
Sheesh...
If you're back to normal, stop that!
Levy-chan, thank you!
All right!
See?
The cheering squad works!
How'd you do it? Tell us!
The words by themselves didn't have any extra meaning.
So I tried reading them backwards.
There aren't many characters in ancient writing,
so in order to express extra meaning, reading them backwards can activate a different effect.
So...
When I read the spell in the opposite direction, the magic was lifted!
I see! Thanks a bunch!
You saved us there, Levy.
It was all for Lu-chan...
It's not lifted!
Me, also! I'm still a cat!
I don't care one way or the other, though.
Too bad, but it seems the other two didn't make it under the time limit.
Oh, no! W-W-What should we do?
Levy, try it again!
Huh? Maybe I didn't say it exactly right...
Then I'll be stuck like this forever?
No! I don't want to be drooling flames forever!
This is a nightmare! It must be!
Although I don't care either way!
Now, now... I'm sure there's got to be some other way.
Have I suddenly gotten shorter?
You can't mean... Mira-san?
Gramps and Mira swapped bodies!
Now this is one nice body!
Anything but that!
You don't mean...
Men don't quit, got that Natsu?
What the heck? My body smells like booze...
What's this? Why am I Elfman?
Whoa, I'm getting drunk real quick...
Hey, Droy...
What, Jet?
We've swapped bodies!
Not that it matters with you two.
But seriously... This nice body is like a dream come true!
Levy, do something!
I think this is out of my league.
Yay! Everyone's switched places! How fun!
This is not something to be happy about!
This magic is not a fantasy.
It is a magic that slightly upsets the balance of one's everyday existence...
And with that, until next time.
Change us back!
You're just going to end it?!
Aye!
That's All Folks
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
chasing after your profile left only in my revolving dreams
You said, I never want to see your face again, when you left me
But the tears on your cheek said it all
Every time you felt like you'd be swallowed up in the waves of contradiction
you always held back your tears, you know?
What a strong person, they said, but everyone overestimated you
and before you knew it you lost sight of who you really are
Then the sun I thought would always be near me collapsed
and the light shut off...
Rubbing out the truths and the lies of one day, altogether
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
still, ironically, chasing after your profile in my revolving dreams
Professor Happy's Fairy Tail Lectures!
Today we'll be introducing all the people at Fairy Tail - Part 2!
The wizards in the guild pick whatever requests they want from the board and go do the jobs.
Form a team with someone you're compatible with, and let's go out on an adventure!
Until next time!
Stand, Bow, Aye!
Erza was all panicking when she turned into you, Happy!
Yeah! And her flying skills needed work.
Makes me think of the time you were born, Happy.
Aye!
But it was Erza on the inside, so she couldn't be 90 as cute as me.
Next time: Natsu and the Dragon Egg!
Well, you were a bit gross right when you were born, Happy.
But I'm sure I was cute!
Yeah. One of those cute'n gross things.
