Whoa, w-wait!
Who are you?
I said, don't talk... I'm Nanamine's assistant
You're Nakai?!
16th place twice in a row?
The same story in the same issue?
Yeah.
That was my arrangement with Ashirogi.
And if you lose this competition,
you'll need to start creating your own work with me.
Is that fine with you?
Kosugi...
For the first time, I'm actually glad to have you as my editor!
I still have nearly 20 advisers who can assist me.
There's no way I'm going to lose!
This'll be a come-from-behind victory! You'll see!
ano ne moshimo ima sugu ni kimi no moto he to
Hey, if I could go to where you are right now
ikeru naraba kono koe ga nakunattemo ii ya
then I could accept losing my voice
mezasu basho ga amari ni mo tooku
The goals I've set myself seem impossible to reach,
boku wa mou michi ni mayoisou da
and I feel lost on my path
kowareta jishaku wo ate ni shiteru n da
I'm relying on a broken compass and hiding in another's shadow
dareka no kage ni kakurete sa
If we keep letting go of some things in order to find something else,
then I'm convinced we can never grow up
tsuzukete mo kitto bokura wa otona ni wa narenai
narenai
Never
Zeal and Utter Defeat
What?!
You'll run the same story in the same issue?
Yep!
We told Nanamine what plot we'll be using for the combo issue.
He's the one who challenged us. There's no way we'll lose.
But Nanamine's getting ideas from 50 people, right?
Will you be all right?
I'm 120 sure we won't lose!
Don't get overconfident, Shuujin!
It's not overconfidence.
It's analysis!
Akito, you're so cool!
Please enlighten us with your analysis!
In a nutshell,
too many cooks spoil the broth.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Cooks?
What does he mean by that?
I don't know either.
To put it simply,
when there are too many people giving orders,
things are bound to get chaotic and go awry.
Um, could you put it even simpler?
Gathering dozens of people, selecting their best ideas, and collating them all into a single work.
Think about how much skill that would take.
Well, I certainly wouldn't able to do that.
Me neither.
In fact, nobody can do that on a weekly basis.

Besides, it's unlikely anyone could lead all those people effectively.
He gathered 50 people on the web, not even knowing who they are.
Let's do it like this, with everyone
Many of them would help out earnestly in the beginning,
Agreed, first let's decide whose idea we'll use for What You Need
Let's make the main character cooler
The heroine should make a good impression
I was just thinking, wouldn't it be better to switch the places of the main character and the heroine?
but some of them would eventually tire of it and start half-assing their work.
Don't forget about panty shots
It's not that kind of a manga, retard
Who did you call retard?
Can we stop fighting and take this seriously?
He didn't include my idea that we were supposed to use
There's no pay and no responsibility involved.
Removed it because it was boring
Why did you do that?
They're anonymous.
Well, this was a good way to kill time for a while
Me too, then...
It's easy for them to just complain and quit.
Pretty arrogant for someone who'll lose anyway
As for their ideas, eccentric and ridiculous ones will always stand out
and appear attractive.
How can you tell all this?
You're just speculating, right?
It's already showing in his work.
He could probably manage things for the one-shot since he had time back then.

However, despite aiming for 1st place, his first serialized chapter only came in 2nd.
He was then continuously pressed for time, and now it's at 15th place.
Recently, What You Need has only been featuring storylines that overlap with PCP's.
That shows that Nanamine isn't good at selectively choosing and compiling great ideas.
Actually, I don't think anybody is.
Man, it's tough to work with such a cliched setting.

It's already been pushed this far back at just Chapter 8.
It obviously hasn't been doing so well on the surveys.
It's Kosugi from Weekly Shounen Jack.
Nanamine, regarding the storyboard you sent me...
I never asked you about that.
The only thing I want to know from you is the ranking.
Chapter 8 placed 16th.
16th?!
It's been in double-digit rankings since the fourth chapter.
I'm telling you that Chapter 11 is going to change all that!
It's about to get canceled!
My life would be ruined if that happened!
I can't go back to the countryside now!
I'll become a hobo!
The second chapter will be done soon,
and it's quite a step up from the first.
Oh, that's Nakai for you.
He's a first class assistant
Then, let's discuss the 4th chapter
One theory is that chapter 4 is the result of the survey about chapter 1
and it's quite a step up from the first.

The January 4th combo issue.
Oh!
This is the showdown issue!
Since you both ran the same story in the same issue,
I doubt anyone would've voted for both of you in the survey.
Yeah.
If they'd voted, it would've been for the one they found more engaging.
Exactly.
What? Another private message?

What You Need has placed 16th for two weeks in a row.
It could get canceled any time now.
Anyway, I'm counting on you guys for an interesting story.
Anyway, give me
16th place twice hin a row?
Nanamine... What a terrible guy.
I'm quitting.
Me too.
Bye-bye, Mr. Liarmine.
Hey, don't just quit and leave more work for the rest of us.
Well, I'm outta here too.
Shoot, then me too.
Guys!
Huh?
Nobody's here?
Then me too.
W-Wait!
I said don't talk, but...
Hey, is anyone here?!
What are you doing?!
Um, it seemed like things were going downhill so...
Outta the way!
Hey, guys!
Anyone there?
It's Kosugi from Weekly Shounen Jack.
Damn it!
I-I'll get the door.
What's wrong with them?!
Happy New Year.
H-Happy New Year.
Where's Mr. Nanamine?
He's in his room as usual.
Now if you'll excuse me...
I'm coming in, Nanamine.
What's wrong?
Ranking...
What's this week's ranking?
If that's good...
We completely lost.
What?!
It placed 19th.
19th?!
What about PCP?
3rd place.
Usually, most of the people who voted for What You Need also voted for PCP.
That wasn't the case this time, however.
The final counts were 240 votes for PCP
and 41 votes for What You Need.
Nanamine!
That's totally hopeless!
I lost!
Damn it!
I thought this was a good way to do it.
19th place, huh?
It dropped quite a bit again.
While both using the same theme, PCP had a far superior story and art.
One could say it all came down to the reader's judgment.
What have you been looking at this whole time?
The first fan letter Nanamine sent us.
and Intelligence in Jack NEXT, I've become a big fan of you
I've been making manga stuff since sixth grade
but now I'm determined to become a real
manga artist like you
I hope this can make Nanamine mend his ways.
This might sound irresponsible,
but we have to leave the rest to Kosugi.
They need to work it out on their own.
Man, I give up.
I've had enough.
The serialization isn't over yet!
And you promised to start working with me if you lost!
That would just make me a pathetic loser.
It's over.
It'll get canceled at the next meeting anyways.
The meeting is on January 29,
so next week's results will still be taken into account.
It might avoid getting canceled if it climbs up the rankings!
It's too early to give up!
Climb up the rankings?
How?
Nakai screwed up, so all of my web advisers are gone.
Nakai's fired now, of course.
No one can save me at this point.
So work with me!
If I worked with you, it'll only make it worse.
That much I'm sure of.
You won't know unless you try!
I already do.
I don't want to look pathetic.
Don't say things like that.
Do you realize how many people aim for a serialization
but continually fail to get one?
So if I quit, it'll open up a spot and bail one of them out, right?
Huh?
Wh-What are you doing?!
I hate you, but I liked how you did everything in your power to succeed.
Or rather, I admired you for it!
And now you're telling me you're giving up?!
I told you, it's over already.
Don't make me repeat myself
It's not over!
I won't let that happen!
You have talent, Nanamine!
You're the one who came up with Classroom of Truth!
You even did most of the art by yourself!
Right?!
I had a lot of free time back then.
And the only idea I came up with there
is the one about people getting eliminated when they lie.
I got stuck after that.
That's what I'm here for!
I can give you advice and help you out from now on!
We'll work together and try again!
You and I aren't leaving this room until you agree with me on that!
What?!
Assault and confinement...
You're nuts!
Leave.
I'm not leaving until you agree to start working with me!
Then I'll leave.
Get out of my way.
I suppose you fancy yourself as one of those passionate editors,
but they're so outdated now.
Nope. Shounen manga needs more passion, crudeness, and sweat.
That's my philosophy.
Then it doesn't match mine.
We'll never get along if you think that way.
Step aside.
You hate me, right?
Why you'd do something this ridiculous is a real mystery to me.
Why? Of course, it's...
This guy actually seems determined to stay here for days.
He's crazy.
H-He's asleep.
How stupid can he get?
See ya.
Nanamine... What a terrible guy.
Bye-bye, Mr. Liarmine.
Then I'll quit too.
That's what I'm here for!
I can give you advice and help you out from now on!
We'll work together and try again!
Oh no!
Nanamine...
You're so loud.
Nanamine!
It's morning, so please don't speak so loudly.
I don't want to annoy the neighbors.
Sorry.
Sorry isn't gonna cut it.
You fell asleep and left me alone
after telling me we'd work together.
It's my storyboard.
Y-You drew it?
Cancellations will be decided at the next meeting.
I'll work on my own until then.
Then it'll all be over.
That should satisfy you.
Well...
I don't want to hear complaints from an editor who talks big then falls asleep.
Just read it over quickly and leave.
Sure!
January 11, Monday

I want to draw another romance manga, no matter what!
Oh, but you have to remember that the NATURAL anime is ending in March.
You need to make sure it doesn't drop in popularity.
I know that!
Okay!
I'm looking forward to the anime version of GIRI!
I can't wait to see it!
It looks like they put a lot of effort into modeling the bikes.
It was so-so.
Iwase hasn't changed a bit.
GIRI's getting an anime.
I'm so jealous.
Ashirogi!
Takahama!
Long time no see.
Seigi no Mikata is pretty good.
It seems to be getting a stable fanbase too.
Thank you for the compliment.
Actually...
Seigi no Mikata is getting a TV drama adaptation!
Drama?!
Amazing!
Congratulations!
Mikata is more suitable for drama than anime, after all.
Yes.
They're all amazing.
Yeah, I envy them.
Kosugi!
Ashirogi!
Good work.
Good work!
Thank you for accepting my unreasonable request last time.
No problem.
How is Nanamine?
He's been drawing storyboards by himself since then.
What You Need did get canceled,
but we'll be working hard together starting from now on.
That's good!
What are you telling them, Kosugi?
What? I'm just thanking them.
Ashirogi, long time no see.
Yeah.
You completely defeated me.
I couldn't beat PCP no matter how hard I tried.
However...
I'll win for sure next time.
We won't lose to someone who set Ashirogi Mutou as his bar, either!
Yeah!
We'll stay on top so that you'll have a goal to pursue!
See you.
The New Year's party just started!
It's fine.
I only came here to say that to Ashirogi.
Wait!
Hold on, Nanamine!
Let's have our next meeting!
I'm glad we went to the New Year's party.
Yeah, seeing everyone keeps me motivated.
For sure.
Oh yeah, Saikou.
Are you going to the reunion?
The elementary school one?
Are you going, Shuujin?
Hmm...
I might if Naoi Ichiko's going.
I wanna see Yama again.
All right! Let's adjust our work schedule so we can make it there.
Sure thing.
What?! Kaya caught a cold?!
Yeah.
She suddenly came down with a fever.
I'll be taking her to the hospital.
Just go to the reunion, Akito.
I can go to the hospital by myself!
You hear her?
She's saying that, but I'm still worried about her.
I'm fine! You worry too much!
Yeah, take care.
BAR
Huh?
Is that you, Mashiro?
Oh, yeah.
Ashirogi is here!
Oh, we've been waiting!
The star has to arrive fashionably late, huh?
Mashiro, there's a seat right here!
It's no fun sitting around just guys. Come here!
Shut up!
I want to talk to him about manga!

Draw one on this for me!
You bought our volume!
Thanks!
My nephew loves it and always imitates it!
He's even got Major strap! down pat!
My little brother got scolded once for imitating one of PCP's perfect crimes in middle school.
Sorry about that.
Have you met Oda, the author of One Piece?
Well, just a few times.
Then how about Kishimoto?
Give him a break, guys.
Saikou can't relax like that.
Oh, Yamashita, of course.
Yama?!
Saikou, you listening to me?
Oh, you'll be working in the KNN? That's amazing.
You're way more amazing.
I heard you'd given up on becoming a manga artist after your uncle passed away.
Yeah.
Are you busy?
Yeah.
I've had time to attend driving school at least once a week recently, though.
I see.
Yeah.
Here!
Here you go, Sensei!
Oh, thanks.
Oh, Ichiko, that's nice of you.
So this is Ichiko, huh?
Are you okay with beer?
Oh, I don't drink alcohol.
At all?
Don't manga artists go drink at Ginza or something?
I've never been to places like that.
Then where do you guys hang out?
We don't hang out, nor do we have time to.
What?!
Well, on weekends we make the storyboard that becomes a basis for the manga,
and I draw the manuscript by Friday.
And the cycle repeats every week.
There's no break!
Mashiro!
We're trying to plan a ski trip.
Wanna come?
Oh no, I might hurt my hands.
And besides, I don't have free time.
Oh, sorry for asking.
I'll go.
Ichiko, you're so sociable.
It must've been tough.
Well...
I've been occupied with manga since my third year of middle school, so other than that...
You devoted your entire youth to it, huh?
What sort of line was that?
Did I sound too old?
Yama!
What is it?
Sorry about this, but can you come here and take charge?
We need some help deciding on a few things.
You guys are so helpless.
Talk to you later, Saikou.
Yeah.
All right, let's hear when each of you is free to go.
Sometime in February for me.
I can make it some time in March.
Late February would be good.
I should have some free time after January.
Hang on.
I can't sort it out if you all talk at once.
Take turns when you talk.
So it's February for you, right?
How about the others?
Saikou!
Is it over?
Yeah. They're having an after-party, but I need to work on the manuscript.
Oh, come on!
I'll go back too, then.
How's Kaya holding up?
She was given an IV drip, so she should be okay now.
She kept bugging me to go.
Why don't you go to the after-party, then?
If you're not going, then I won't.
How was the reunion?
Huh?
Oh, they all seemed to be having fun.
They? Didn't you have fun?
It was nice seeing old friends like Yama.
But...
But what?
We're different from them.
Huh?
Since our third year in middle school, all we've done is manga,
and never really went out and had fun.
Do you wish you could've had fun like normal people?
Nah.
I am who I am now because I didn't.
I think I spent my time well.
It's just that I felt I'm different from them.
It's just like your beloved Ashita no Joe manga.
Yeah, I've worked pretty hard.
I poured my whole self into this without letting myself get sidetracked.
And now I've got a serialization.
I see.
You're right.
We're still trying to achieve our dream, though.
We still haven't beaten Eiji,
and the only 1st place ranking we've gotten so far is from PCP's first chapter.
Not to mention not getting an anime adaptation.
Yeah.
We're definitely not there yet.
We still have a long way to go, and we can't afford to hang out like everyone else.
But we're happy.
We came this far with our dream.
We might have missed out on linking up with our peers,
but we've been inking those pages.
And it's fine that way.
Let's keep working hard to achieve our dream.
Yep!
I'm back.
That was fast!
Why aren't you resting?!
I got hungry after the fever went down.

You're better, then.
Yeah, I'm fine now!
Just get plenty of rest.
Yep!
But jeez, the news is all bad today.
I wonder if there's news that'd really cheer me up.
There was only a letter left in the vault.
The police announced that the door to the back of the vault was wrenched open,
Bank Robbery?
Bank Robbery?

and a letter was found inside the vault.
You see, this manga, which is currently serialized
in a certain magazine, has protagonists that commit perfect crimes.
It featured a case very similar to this incident.

Break into a bank, take nothing, but leave a note saying I got in.
How cool is that!?
Yeah, pretty cool
And it doesn't harm anyone.
But wouldn't that destroy the reputation of the security firm?
Oh, I guess so
And of the bank itself, too
It's not realistic in the first place, either.
