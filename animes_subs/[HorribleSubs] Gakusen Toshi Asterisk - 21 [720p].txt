How enjoyable! How truly enjoyable!
But this isn't all!
This isn't the extent of my power! Not by a long shot!
I hope you haven't forgotten me!

Clinching Victory
The figures for this rate of increase are insane!
You need to stop him right now!
But RM-C's already ceded Limit Control,
so there's nothing I can do now.
You can still force-quit, can't you?
The puppet's central system could sustain some damage,
but that's what should be done if necessary!
That's your responsibility.
Responsibility, huh?
See, it might not be so obvious, but I really do have faith...
in them, that is.
Ayato...
What on earth is that?
We should've realized it sooner.
No matter how ironclad that protective wall may be,
it can't possibly trade blows head-on with the Ser=Versta.
The only thing that was able to do that was...
The Gravi-Sheath, eh?
That's right.
Unless it's another Ogre Lux,
it shouldn't be able to block the Ser=Versta's attacks.
AR-D must be using Ulm Manadite as his engine.
Wait!
You mean that was AR-D rampaging out of control right now?
No, though I'm sure all that power's more than he can manage,
most likely AR-D is...
I see!
So this is it! This is my true power!
No wonder my master warned me about it!
He has it under control?
Now, then, I hate to see this end, but what do you say we settle this now?
Let's go!
Ayato, get back!
Come out, Rafflesia!
Impossible...
Now, then, it's my turn to pay you back!
No way!
Now, then... you will explode!
Now, then, why don't we pick up where we left off?
Ayato, are you all right?
Julis!
I-I'm all right.
Or at least I'd like to say so, but maybe not this time.
If only I could eclipse his speed, then I could strike a decisive blow.
Speed, eh?
H-Hold up!
Julis, what are you...
I remember Claudia telling me once
that the Ser=Versta is known to assume the form that best suits its wielder.
If we can make it do that, wouldn't that give us some chance of winning?
Look, I'm not good at making minor tweaks to my Prana.
I mean I'm hopeless.
Then let me handle that part.
All you have to do is pour your Prana into this sword.
A-All right!
Ayato, try to picture it.
The ideal Ser=Versta that you can wield most comfortably
in terms of shape and size!
It's done!
This is your...
Ayato Amagiri's Ser=Versta!
This is...
the ideal form for me?
This is all that I can do in this match.
Julis!
I'm leaving the rest to you, Ayato!
Roger that, Julis.
Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?
No, no, as it happens, I was a bit out of shape myself.
Now I'm going to end this!
This match is mine!
I won't let you!

Winners, Ayato Amagiri and Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld!
We lost!
I have been trounced!
A-At last! At last, it's over!
After a showdown of epic proportions, the Phoenix Festa has been won by...
Seidoukan Academy's Ayato Amagiri and Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld!
The two-week-long Phoenix Festa.
Once again, we've seen numerous epic battles.
And we were particularly astonished by AR-D and RM-C's fighting skills, right?
Oh, yes!
And the team that prevailed against them in that slugfest of a final was...
Seidoukan Academy's Amagiri/Riessfield team!
And now, offering his congratulations to Ayato Amagiri
is the Steering Committee chairman, Mr. Madiath Mesa!
Ayato Amagiri and Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld,
I commend you both for your brilliant triumph,
your unbreakable spirit and this glorious victory.
I found your matches extremely compelling.
I'm looking forward to seeing what you'll accomplish in the next festa.
Congratulations on your victory.
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, please give Mr. Amagiri a warm round of applause!
All right, everybody, see you again next time, at the Gryps Festa.
Festa commentary was brought to you by yours truly, Meeko Yanase and...
Your analyst, Pham Thi Tram!
Grimalkin...
Golden Eye... Number 7.
And your name is...
Verner, right?
That scar on your cheek... I know it well.
You're a Shadow Star shinobi, right?
You... Whose orders are you carrying out?
You tell me.
Congratulations on winning!
That's my Ayato!
Thanks, Saya...
It was a truly magnificent match.
That's my Ayato!
I owe it all to you guys.
I mean it. Thanks!
No, it wasn't just us.
Kirin, Yabuki and MacPhail all pitched in, too.
Lester?
Th-There's nothing to thank me for!
That bastard Yabuki blackmailed me,
so I had no choice but to help out. That's all!
Thanks, Lester. I owe you one.
Huh? Come to think of it, where is Yabuki?
The bastard bounced in the middle of the battle!
Dragging me out there, then ditching me...
Next time I see him, he's gonna wish he was never born!
It's called a Transformation Spell.
Oh, crap...
That was brand-new, wasn't it?
But sorry, Ayato.
We couldn't capture the perpetrator.
No need to apologize.
I mean, you all got out of there safely.
That's the most important thing.
Ayato...
All right, I'm out of here.
See ya!
Oh, wait...
What's up, Lester?
Well, uh... you know...
What the heck...
Let me just say, Congrats.
Lester?
That MacPhail...
He just can't show his honest feelings, can he?
Uh...
Can we help...
What do you want?
Saya Sasamiya...
I wish for a rematch with you.
I don't see why. We lost to you.
During yesterday's semifinal,
you and Dr. Sasamiya's Lux was clearly superior to RM-C.
But not enough to beat the fused AR-D.
Using the fused AR-D is virtually the same as using an Ogre Lux.
Ferrovius's philosophies are incompatible with anything as unstable as an Ogre Lux.
Therefore, I personally cannot acknowledge that as a victory.
Gotcha. Let's duel again and settle the score.
Next time, I'm going to pummel you until there's nothing left
and finish you off once and for all.
In that case, we'll have to be better than you.
Right.
Why don't you give me your answer from the other day?
Answer?
Whether or not you're going to join forces with us.
Oh, that! Right.
Of course, my answer is...
No!
You guys just aren't my cup of tea!
But...
are you sure you're really going to be able to finish the third puppet?
You can't find any compatible Ulm Manadite, can you?
So I see. Hats off to you!
I still haven't even told Camilla about her yet.
Just what you'd expect of Rewolf, right?
All right.
I guess I can at least listen to what you have to say.
Fine. I'll be in touch.
All righty, who knows what's going to happen next?
Congratulations on your victory, Ayato-senpai.
Thanks.
But I was only able to win because you guys did such a great job.
You did great, Kirin.
O-Oh no, not at all...
I didn't do anything.
Oh, Julis...
Are the police done questioning you?
Yes.
I gave them an earful about what a heinous guy Dirk Eberwein is.
Right, Flora?
What are you doing, Flora?
What's wrong, Flora?
Oh, uh, everybody...
I know I caused you all so much trouble!
Hey, listen.
It wasn't your fault that it happened, Flora.
But it was such an important match for you and the princess.
And to make matters worse, Lady Toudou got these terrible injuries!
It's high time you let it go, Flora.
You're a good kid, but you're still only ten.
It's all right to cry when you feel like it.
Y-Your Highness...
Your Highness!
I was so scared!
You were so brave, Flora. You're safe now.
Whoa.
Well?
Julis?
Well...
True, I did summon you here because I wanted to talk to you.
But when push comes to shove...
Um... in other words...
L-Listen, you!
S-Sorry!
Oh, hey, this is nothing.
I appreciate it, but you don't have to.
If I stained your precious handkerchief,
you'd challenge me to another duel.
If I hadn't teamed up with you, I couldn't have gotten this far.
Thanks to you, my wish came true, as well.
I never thought I'd come this far either... not without you.
But this is merely one checkpoint for us.
We have a long way to go.
I'll join you for the ride. For you and for myself.
You will?
Yeah.
Then let's start with a toast!
To celebrate today's victory.
Right.
Hoping for our next victory.
The perpetrators have been arrested.
The abduction was carried out
by a mafia gang running the casino where Ms. Klem was held captive.
Impossible! That was clearly the work of...
Unfortunately,
we haven't been able to find a shred of evidence
linking the Dante Ms. Sasamiya and Ms. Toudou fought to any specific academy.
It looks like the investigation will continue,
so I'd like you to take a more long-term view of this.
Very well.
- By the way, Amagiri... - Yes, sir?
I hear that as the winner of the Phoenix Festa,
you've requested a search for your older sister.
Right.
If she went missing here in Asterisk,
I'm sure there must be some clues left behind.
I'll be praying for her safe return.
Thank you very much.
Seriously, thanks to you, I'm completely swamped!
I only did it out of concern for you!
Even so, your methods were too violent this time.
Next time, I wish you'd try to hold back a little.
Talk to you later.
By the way,
aren't you going to tell him about your relationship with that woman?
Sorry, but I have no intention of going there.
Because it's a private matter.
Now, then...
what am I going to do about this?
Now...
That's strange. For some reason, I'm recalling a scandal...
Oh, but there's nothing we can do about the past.
Julis, my Ayato...
Congratulations on winning the Phoenix Festa!
