This is... Lord Wales'...
The letter has been taken,
and the Prince's life was taken in front of my eyes...
The greatest responsibility for all of this is mine.
I couldn't see the truth about Wardes...
Now, lift your head, Louise FranCoise.
Thank you for his final memento and will...
Thank you, Louise...
Princess...
A history of the couple's romance that starts from the first kiss
You, the one who cast magic on this destiny, suddenly appeared
The sky where two moons never fade away
That's an impossibility, right?
This is the first time I've felt anything like this
I'm feeling more and more at ease with this place
Even if you trip and become depressed
I will always hold you tight with a squeeze
The story where we met that day stays hot with a sweet kiss
See, you can cast magic, and the wishes will surely come true
A history of the couple's romance that starts from the first kiss
You, the one who cast magic on this destiny, suddenly appeared
Zero Treasure
Isn't this another false lead, as usual?
This time, I am sure that this information is true!
Come in.
Oh, Miss Valliere.
Hello, Mr. Colbert...
Um... I'm here to report...
All right, I'll accept your vacation notice.
About how many days?
We are heading to the village of Talb,
so I believe that we will be back by the solar eclipse at the latest.
Then, if you will excuse me...
Mr. Colbert is taking some time off?
Apparently, he has found the location of the legendary dragon.
Legendary dragon?
He's gone on a search for a legendary something in the past,
and almost stranded himself out in the ocean.
Well, I'm not counting on him much.
Now, let's hear the report.
Yes, sir.
The Reconquista?
This looks like it will be rather troublesome.
Thank you for the hard work. You should take a nice vacation.
Um, Old Osman?
Do you know about the descendant of the Void?
My memory is uncertain,
and I don't know who it was that called me that,
but I'm sure...
Void is the legendary element of magic that has long been lost.
Legendary?
Such amazing magic...
Or rather, even normal magic for me is, well, um...
You don't have to go into the details.
I guess Gundolf is for real as well.
Gundolf?
Saito is the legendary familiar?
That's impossible.
Here we go...
I'm back.
What is it?
I can't stay in clothes stained from such a long journey!
So I was just changing clothes.
Oh, so there was more laundry.
Geez.
If you complain too much, you can do without food!
Yeah, yeah...
How can you go back to normal like that?
You kissed me!
You know...
What is it?
How do I put it...
Cheer up, okay?
Well, this is about all I can say.
Saito...
The elastic is broken.
Yeah, it's broken for sure.
What does that mean?
You say that, but...
Oh, well.
You don't suppose, back then...
Back then?
Oh, no, nothing.
I mean, it's not something I did on purpose!
I'm just disciplining a familiar
that doesn't take good care of his master's belongings.
I can't possibly be disciplined over a pair of panties!
It's not that I wanted to do that when I did it, either!
That's right! You're just a familiar because you can't help it,
because otherwise you can't eat!
That's right! Looks like you do understand!
If you hate it that much, you can get out of here!
Oh, is that so?
This familiar will follow his master's orders, master!
That hurt!
Geez!
I was looking out for her! That selfish girl!
Why did I do such a thing?
Such a thing?
Siesta!
That outfit...
I was granted vacation, so I'm going home for a while.
I see, going back home.
It's a rather small village.
At least, you're lucky you have a place to go back to.
Come to think of it, you said before
that your grandfather came from another world?
Yes, that would be my great-grandfather.
Can you tell me the details of that story?
I was on a desperate journey for the sake of our country,
but Montmorency thinks that I went on vacation to cheat on her.
That's all thanks to your usual everyday behavior.
So can you tell her...
Geez, Saito, are you cheating with a girl like that again?
Kirche! My favor...
Shut up!
Two dragons?!
Yes.
The first one disappeared in the solar eclipse,
and my great-grandfather was aboard the second dragon.
One disappeared from there,
and the other fell somewhere, they say.
Seriously? And what happened to that dragon?
Apparently, it is a family heirloom,
and has been enshrined somewhere.
Though I've never seen it.
Siesta!
Yes? Siesta!
Yes?
Yes? Can you take me to your village?
Can you take me to your village?
What?
Did you hear that?
Yeah... A treasure...
Tabitha, what do you think?
Not interested.
I'm super-interested!
Back then, I hated it, but I couldn't help it...
Geez!
Why can't I get it out of my mind?!
I've said too much. I'm sorry...
No, that doesn't sound dignified enough as a master.
I'll forgive you. You should be thankful of it!
Maybe a bit too harsh?
Where did he go?
Someone's trying to apologize here...
Siesta?
She just left, saying she was going to see her folks back home.
Going home?
Yeah. To the village of Talb. Anything wrong with Siesta?
No, nothing. Thank you.
Siesta's home, is it?!
That dog is always in heat!
He kissed me, yet... Kissed me, yet...
Kissed me, yet... Kissed me, yet...
He kissed me, yet...
The village of Talb?
I've heard of it somewhere.
It's just a little more.
It's really nice here.
Um, is it all right?
What is?
Coming out here without permission from Miss Valliere...
It's all right.
Mr. Saito...
I'll wait here.
Here? Please come to our house.
I'd like to properly introduce you to everyone in the family.
Properly...
Come on, wouldn't that cause a misunderstanding?
I see.
Oh, well, um... If you get that depressed...
I'm sorry.
This is important to you, isn't it, Mr. Saito?
Then I'll look up the location of the treasure, and be right back.
Thanks. Sorry to be a bother, Siesta.
It's all right.
She's such a good girl.
Yeah,
much more than that selfish girl that has nothing but pride.
But your real feelings are over there, after all?
Of course not! You stay quiet!
The village of Talb is right up ahead!
I secretly brought out what was hidden in the back of the shed.
Is the dragon here?
Apparently, the correct name for it is the Robe of the Dragon.
Robe?
Yes.
I heard that my great-grandfather flew from another world using it.
Using?
There they are.
Kirche?
Mole?
That means...
Hey.
You guys... Why... Hey.
You guys... Why...
Or rather, what for?
Of course, it's to look for the treasure!
What?!
It's this cave?
I'm so excited!
You know, I'm not playing around here.
Neither am I.
I have the fine objective of finding a hidden treasure,
so that Montmorency will get a better opinion of me!
What a grand objective!
I'm so looking forward to this. I couldn't do much back in Albion.
Albion...
I wonder what happened to them after that incident.
Lord Cromwell!
Lord Cromwell!
Finally, the Tudor family that had been using
this country of Albion for themselves have all fallen.
Glory to the newly reborn Albion!
Hurray for Albion! Hurray for Albion!
I wonder how far this goes?
I don't know. Not even the village folk get near here.
It's said to have a nest of orc demons.
Say things like that before we go in!
Someone is coming.
Someone?
Someone other than us...
These are footsteps, right?
From behind us...
Seems that way.
Who is it?!
Who's there?!
Siesta, behind me!
Okay!
That was a warning.
If you value your life, leave now!
Dammit!
Verdande!
Wait, this voice...
You thieves, going after a valuable historical relic!
Mr. Colbert!
You guys?
Louise?!
I gained information that the ruins of the dragon was here,
and I came here to excavate,
but to think that all of you would...
So our objectives are the same?
Objective?
Oh... This is...
Then, are you someone who is of the blood of another world?
To think that such a valuable piece of research material
was so close at hand! What an oversight!
It's just a legend,
and I'm not sure whether that map is correct or not...
I'm here as an aide to our instructor's research.
It's not that I came chasing after you or anything.
I didn't say anything.
I didn't want you to misunderstand,
so I just said it first!
And why would I misunderstand?!
You know, lovers' quarrels are nice and all...
It's not a lover's quarrel!
But you'll be left behind.
This is turning out to be just like a class. Watch your step! Don't get out of line!
It was a fun treasure hunt in the beginning. Watch your step! Don't get out of line!
It was a fun treasure hunt in the beginning.
No time for small talk!
This is...
Amazing.
How fitting, for a hidden treasure to rest here.
And the treasure?
According to the map, it's around here.
That is...
If it's a key of this nature,
it looks like it can be unlocked with magic.
Tabitha, what are you looking at?
Those are unfamiliar letters.
Okay, it's opening up!
Navy Ensign, Sasaki Takeo,
rests here in another world...
You can read it?
It's Japanese...
The language of my home country.
What?!
Here it is! This is it!
What is this?
I've never seen anything like this before.
This is the Robe of the Dragon?
You're kidding...
I'm certain.
There's no doubt about it.
A Zero fighter!
It looks like it has been preserved with stability magic.
To think it really existed...
You know, when I first saw you, Siesta,
somehow, I got a feeling of nostalgia...
I see. The black hair and eyes came from Japanese blood.
Japanese?
Your great-grandfather and I come from the same world.
Saito!
You might be able to return to your world!
They appeared together with the solar eclipse,
and one Robe of the Dragon disappeared into the eclipse.
Why couldn't the other one, in other words, this one, return as well?
It is said that my great-grandfather
flew around in the skies even after the other Robe disappeared,
and in due time landed...
I believe he missed the right timing for it.
Timing?
The solar eclipse must have ended while he was flying,
and he couldn't return.
In other words, if you fly into the solar eclipse
with this Robe of the Dragon,
perhaps you will be able to fly back into your alternate world?
Then, if Mr. Saito was to get inside this,
and plunge into the solar eclipse,
he can go back to his world?
Well, that is only an assumption that I've made,
but that possibility is rather high.
There's a chance that I can go back?
Saito is going to be gone...
Then what of the letter sent to Wales of Albion, my nephew?
There is no mistake, Archduchess Marian.
I have received word from Germania
that they would like to call off the engagement.
My haphazard actions have caused this situation.
Please, punish me however much you want.
You have been through enough pain already,
with the death of your loved one.
That which has passed cannot be helped.
Let us accept all of it as destiny.
Mother...
Your Highness!
There is a crisis!
To think you'd really find it...
I thought you'd get stranded up in the mountains this time.
I thank you for your efforts
in transporting and becoming caretaker of the Robe.
Something of this caliber...
I'm sure I can get permission to have it at the Institute
as valuable research material deemed by the Palace.
Now for fuel...
That's right!
Mr. Colbert!
If you can make lots of this,
I'm sure the Robe of the Dragon will work!
Oh, just as I thought!
I was not mistaken when I thought that was the blood of the dragon?!
It's not blood, it's gasoline.
Gasoline?
Hup...
This is the rudder...
And this is the pitch lever...
Is this for real? I really know it all!
That's why I told you you'd know if you got on.
You can freely use all sorts of arms and weapons.
That's what this is, right?
Yeah, there's no mistake that this was a weapon of war.
Saito...
Saito is going to be gone...
Louise!
We have a huge problem!
Shut up.
I just heard in the village...
What did you hear? Another rumor of a cute girl?
Albion...
Albion?!
Albion changed its name to the New State of the Reconquista...
And declared war on Tristein!
You're kidding, right?
But when is a solar eclipse coming?
All of Albion, nobles and peasants alike,
are bowing down in servitude to you, Your Excellency.
What should be feared is the magical power hidden in this ring.
It was worth the efforts taken in taking it from the Water Spirit.
But this is only a foothold,
in order to take the entire continent as mine.
Next, we will take the country
in the center of the continent, Tristein.
We have already set up for that.
Tristein no longer has anywhere to escape to.
They're no match for the esteemed Dragoons of Albion,
as soon as we send them in.
Now, when will this land of Albion be closest to the continent?
In three days...
On the day of the solar eclipse.
As if I were under a real magic spell
A bright smile is burnt onto my heart
But each time I see you, I give you a pointy, cold shoulder
Why do I act mean towards the one that I think about the most?
My true feelings, the shards of loneliness
In the deepest part of my heart, I'm calling for you
For the day to start from zero
Since when has there been pain in my heart when we have an argument?
Since when is it that I can't help
but think of the girl that's standing next to you?
Farewell, Saito.
