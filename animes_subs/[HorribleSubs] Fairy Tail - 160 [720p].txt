How's Lucy?
I think she's okay.
She said she wants to take a shower.
So you want me to check on her one more time?
Y-You can't! Not now...
Why not?
Forget it.
The second match is starting.
This kinda thing gets the blood pumpin', ya know?
It's the first day of the Grand Magic Games.
The battle part continues with the second match,
featuring Ren Akatsuki of Blue Pegasus versus
Arania Webb of Mermaid Heel!
Bad Omen!
It looks like you've improved since last year, Arania.
Are you sure it's okay for a member of Blue Pegasus to attack a woman, Ren-chan?
It seems like both opponents are standing their ground!
It should be a good match!
Ren-kun, good luck!
Sherry is cheering you on from the stands!
You're wide open, Ren-chan!
Ren, what are you doing?!
Do your best!
Cut it out, Sherry!
You don't root for members of an enemy team!
Oh, come on, Obaba. They are engaged...
Shut up.
Spin.
I'm spinning!
W-Who says we're engaged?!
We just happen to be stuck with each other is all!
That's terrible!
It's annoying the way you're always by my side...
You're into it!
Oh, Ren...
Sherry sure fell in love with a pain in the ass.
But that's love...
The one thing I can't do is look lame
in front of you!
Aerial Phose!
He won!
The winner... Ren Akatsuki of Blue Pegasus!
With this, Blue Pegasus has 14 points for the first day!
Mermaid Heel has three points!
Shoot... I let down my guard...
That's our Ren-kun!
Unsurprisingly, he's improved compared to seven years ago.
Don't tell me that Ichiya's gotten stronger, too?!
Natsu, what are you talking about?
Ichiya has always been a man to reckon with.
His personality leaves something to be desired,
but there's no denying that he's Blue Pegasus's strongest wizard.
I didn't know...
Ichiya, huh?
I suddenly wanna fight him!
But what bothers me
is that person in the bunny costume.
So it is alright to be bugged by that...
Good! I thought maybe we weren't supposed to mention it.
Next up, the third match of day one!
War Cry of Quatro Cerberus
versus Orga Nanagear of Team Sabertooth!
There he is!
It's Orga!
Kick his ass!
Listen to those cheers! The crowd loves him!
You can beat him, War Cry!
Your soul is always wild!
It's War Cry.
You gotta see this. I like that guy's magic.
Certainly, it is amusing.
I remember it.
Not interested.
I'm only interested... in you...
We finally get to see a Sabertooth battle.
I wonder if he's as strong as that masked ball guy...
Who do you think is gonna win, Lecter?
Orga-kun, of course!
Oh, of course...
Sting-kun is number one, but everyone in Sabertooth is strong!
You really are dumb, Frosch, if you don't even know that.
Fro thinks so, too.
Let the third match begin!
There it is! War Cry's Tear Magic!
That's a funny phrase, isn't it?
He's crying!
Tear Magic?
What kind of magic is that?!
The more I cry...
Lightning...
L-Lightning?!
One... attack...
The match is over! Literally, in a flash!
Orga's Black Lightning fried the tears instantaneously!
What was that?!
Instantaneously?!
H-He's a monster!
He's strong! I mean, really strong!
The winner is Orga Nanagear of Sabertooth!
That brings their total to 20 points!
A perfect first day!
Quatro Cerberus has two points! Too bad!
Couldn't you have made it more fun, Orga?!
I'll sing a song.
That's not what I meant!
Mic!
Oh, my! What does Orga Nanagear want to say?!
The strongest, the strongest, number one!
We're the leaders, Sabertooth!
The strongest, the strongest, number one!
We're the leaders, Sabertooth!
The strongest, the strongest, number one!
They really do have raw power... and popularity...
We're the leaders, Sabertooth!
They're the strongest guild, huh?
I hate to admit it, but those guys are impressive.
Alright, it's time for the final match of the first day.
The teams that are left are Fairy Tail B and Lamia Scale, right?
Long ago, these two guilds were about equal in terms of talent,
so this should be an interesting match!
Okay, I'll announce the first day's final fight match-up!
It's Mystogan of Fairy Tail B versus
Jura Neekis of Lamia Scale!
There he is!
Jura!
I've been waiting to see Jura!
I never thought he'd participate from the first day!
Jellal all of a sudden?!
And his opponent is Jura!
Even in Fairy Tail, those who know his true face are few...
The mysterious wizard, Mystogan!
Who the heck is that?!
That's a laugh!
Good luck, Jura-san!
This match is as good as over.
It hasn't even started yet!
I know that. Stifle yourself.
It's Jura!
Jura's here!
It's the real thing!
That Jura person sure is popular.
Well, sure. He's one of the Ten Great Wizard Saints.
The same as our master...
This is unlucky.
Going up against Jura...
Is that cueball really that strong?
I don't even know if Erza and I could beat him working together...
Leave it to me.
Personally, I'm rooting for Fairy Tail,
but our Obaba is really strict about that...
My apologies, but I'm not going to hold back here.
Neither am I.
This isn't exactly what I'm here for,
but being able to fight on behalf of Fairy Tail...
Nothing could make me happier.
No need to worry, First Master. It'll be fine.
That man was once a Wizard Saint himself.
In other words, you could say their talents are equal.
First Master?
I-I want to go to the ladies' room...
Even though you're a ghost?!
Jellal... Will you be okay?!
Wha...?! Jellal's going to fight?!
His cover won't be blown, will it?
I pray he doesn't make a mess of it...
Mainly, I hope he doesn't try to impress Erza.
Jura Neekis of Lamia Scale versus
Mystogan of Fairy Tail B!
Let the final match of the day...
What I can do for Fairy Tail...
Wow!
Five Layered Magic Circle... Sacred Song!
So he's copying Mystogan's magic...
Clever...
Jura-san!
There's no need to worry.
With apologies to Juvia's team,
I believe Jura-san is Fiore's number one wizard.
Three Layered Magic Circle... Mirror Water!
It ricocheted!
Awesome!
It turned again!
That's some kind of strong! He isn't called one of the Ten Great Wizard Saints for nothing!
Now, Jura! Hurry up and finish him off!
Send him spinning!
You're spinning me!
As I suspected, he's not an opponent I can beat with borrowed magic.
Meteor!
This guy...
He's fast!
Iron Rock Wall!
There!
I made it!
Magic Circles in the sky!
When did he...?!
He must have drawn them while defending from the attack.
Be judged by the seven stars!
Grand Chariot!
Rock Mountain!
I see...
I know who you are.
So Makarov-dono wasn't being entirely candid with me.
Makarov-dono...
A gathering of the Ten Great Wizard Saints is coming soon...
I was on guard then,
but I never imagined you would pose as a member of Fairy Tail.
My vigilance was for naught.
I have to win for Fairy Tail.
I'm sorry, Ultear.
I'm going to use that!
Wha...?! Jellal!
No! If you use that, your cover will be blown!
True Heavenly Body Magic... Cerma!
What is this?!
What the hell is he thinking?!
This is what's wrong with men! Their pride gets the better of them!
What should we do, Ul?!
The inside of my mouth...
Spicy!
Eat more red pepper!
Come on, come on...
It's spicy!
What on Earthland is happening?!
Suddenly, Mystogan is in agony!
How about this?!
Stop it, Ul!
And now, he's started laughing!
I've got more...
We can do this...
And this!
I can't take any more! Stop it!
He's down!
I don't really understand it, but Mystogan is down!
Sorry about that...
We can't afford to let Jellal stand out too much.
The winner is Jura Neekis of Lamia Scale!
You did great, Jura!
Are we sure about this?
And with this, the first day of the Grand Magic Games comes to a close!
Here's the overall ranking!
A team has zero points and B team has one point?!
That's awful...
We shouldn't have participated in this thing after all...
What do you think, Yajima-san?
It's no surprise that Sabertooth is number one.
On the other hand, Fairy Tail, which has two teams,
is in 7th and 8th place.
It's still just the first day.
I'm hoping for a comeback drama from tomorrow on.
And my guild still has a shot at victory.
I can't wait for day two!
Yajima-san, Jenny-san, thank you very much for your commentary today.
Thank you.
See you all again!
What was that?!
What is he, in charge of Fairy Tail's gags?!
That was hilarious!
Ah, well...
What just happened there?!
Meldy's doing, most likely.
What the hell were you doing?!
Good try.
Lame...
I can't even find the words to respond.
Lucy!
Are you alright?
Yeah. I'm fine now.
Last place...
It was the end of the first day of the Grand Magic Games.
We, Fairy Tail, made a terrible showing...
She's ripening...
Several days after the end of the Grand Magic Games...
This is for you, my dear friend, Lucy Heartfilia.
From Levy McGarden.
W-What was that?! A prophecy?!
Don't worry, Lucy! I'll be in it tomorrow!
And I swear I'll turn things around for us!
Natsu, we're in last place! We have zero points!
Shut up! We'll turn the tables on'em starting now!
Especially with me participatin' in the next competition!
Chariot, huh? I wonder what kind of competition that'll be...
No matter what kind of competition, I'm gonna win it!
It looks like that jerk from Saber and Gajeel are gonna be in it, too!
That doesn't matter! I'm gonna win!
I'm counting on you, Natsu!
Next time: Chariot!
But Chariot, that's like a vehicle pulled by horses, right?
A vehicle...
I've got a bad feeling about this...
Alright! See ya from the winner's circle!
