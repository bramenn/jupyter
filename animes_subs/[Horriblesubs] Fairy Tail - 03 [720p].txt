The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
Last time on Fairy Tail!
This is the request board where you can choose any job you want!
Ooh, it's the key for White Doggy!
Hey, if I don't do a job soon, I won't have anything to eat!
I'm Lucy, a wizard!
And this is the city of Magnolia, flourishing with magic and commerce since long ago!
Kardia Cathedral rises above the city center, and a bit separated from it is the city's only guild, Fairy Tail!
And this is the house where I live now.
The rent's 70,000 jewel!
I sure found a good place.
It's really spacious for 70,000 jewel, and it's got plenty of closets!
Not to mention it has a slightly retro fireplace and a kitchen stove!
But, the best part of all is...
Yo!
Why the heck are you two here?!
'Cause we heard from Mira that you'd picked out a place...
Aye...
You heard, so you just barge in?
No matter how close friends we are, don't you understand the concept of common courtesy?
You just committed breaking and entering!
That's a crime, you know!
Hey, that hurts, man.
I'm the one who's suffering here...
Nice room!
Don't sharpen your claws, you cat creature!
What's this?
Don't look!!
Now I'm curious.
What is that?
Haven't you done enough? Go home already!
No way! I came to hang out!
I can't believe this guy...
Infiltrate the Everlue Mansion!
I just moved in, so I don't have anything to entertain you.
Go home after you finish your tea, okay?
She sure is cold-hearted...
Aye...
Cold-hearted, you say?
Oh, yeah!
Show me all those key guys you have, Lucy.
They're not key guys they're Celestial Spirits.
How many Celestial Spirits do you have contracts with, Lucy?
Six!
3 silver and 3 gold!
These silver keys are the ones that are sold in stores.
The Clock, Horologium.
The Southern Cross, Crux.
The Harp, Lyra.
Then the gold ones are super-rare keys that open the twelve Gates of the Zodiac.
The Golden Bull, Taurus.
The Water Bearer, Aquarius.
And The Giant Crab, Cancer!
A crab?!
Crab!
There they go again zoning in on the weirdest parts...
Now that I think about it, I still haven't made the contract with the key I bought at Halgeon.
Since you're here and all, I'll show the process a Celestial wizard goes through to make a contract with a Celestial Spirit.
I wonder if she has to sign a blood pact?
Sounds painful... for your butt.
Why are talking about my butt?
And you know I can hear you.
Whatever, just watch.
I am linked to the path to the world of Celestial Spirits!
Now! O Spirit, answer my call and pass through the Gate!
Gate of Canis Minor, I open thee!
Nicolas!
There's always next time.
I didn't screw up!
How cute!
I-It is?
It doesn't take much magic power to open Nicolas's gate, so they're popular to keep as Spirit pets!
Natsu, this is clearly a case of human's pride.
Luigi is definitely a scary one...
It's Lucy!
And I can hear you...
Okay, let's move on to the contract.
How's Monday?
Tuesday?
Wednesday?
Kind of basic, huh?
Aye.
Okay, contract complete!
Looks pretty simple.
Yeah!
It seems that way, sure, but it's crucial.
Celestial wizards work by contract.
In other words, promises are everything to us.
Therefore, there's no way I'll break a promise!
See?
Oh yeah!
I have to decide on a name.
Wasn't it named Nicolas?
That's the name for the variety.
That's it!
Come here, Plue!
Plue?
Doesn't the name sound cute?
Right, Plue?
You sure he likes it?
Of course he does!
Plue's a Lesser Dog but he doesn't bark, does he?
That's strange.
It's not like you meow, either.
I wonder what it's trying to say?
Plue, right on, man!
They communicated!
W-What?
Okay, I've decided!
Join us and let's form a team!
I see!
A team?
Aye!
Everyone in the guild are allies, but the people who really get along well join together to form teams.
A request that might be difficult for one person can be handled easily by a team, see!
That's great!
Sounds like fun!
Okay, we're all set then!
Signed and sealed!
Aye, sir!
Let's hurry up and do a job!
Look, I already picked one out!
My, how hasty you are...
Let me take a look.
Shirotsume town, huh?
No way!
200,000 jewel just for taking a single book from the mansion of this Duke Everlue person?
See? Isn't it a steal?
He's a dirty old pervert and currently recruiting blond-haired maids.
And Lucy's blond, isn't she?
Let's get her to infiltrate the mansion dressed as a maid.
You planned this from the beginning!
So I hear those Celestial wizards never break their promises...
How impressive!
You tricked me, huh?!
Okay, it's practice time.
Try calling Happy Master.
No way! Not to a cat!
Did someone take that 200,000 jewel job for some book?
Yes, Natsu said he was gonna invite Lucy along with him.
Aww. That's what I get for hesitating.
It might be better that you didn't go, Levy.
Master.
Since I just got a message from the client.
It's been canceled?
No. It seems the reward has been upped to 2,000,000 jewel!
10 times more?!
2,000,000 jewel for a single book?!
That's the kind of reward you get for subduing monsters!
Why was it increased so suddenly...
Seems like it got pretty interesting.
Gray, look down.
Are you having a comfortable ride, Master?
It's a match maid in hell...
Hey, I'm the one that's playing the Master part!
Shut up, cat!
By the way, Natsu...
Why did you want to form a team with me?
'Cause you're pretty sweet, you know?
I think he's trying to say he recognizes my skills...
But you're also pretty weird...
This guy just called me weird?
Anyway, this is my first job, okay?
I'm gonna finish it up lickity split!
Wait, didn't you dislike it?
I'm up against a dirty old man!
I might not look it, but I'm just a little bit confident in my sex appeal.
As a cat, I really can't tell.
Let's get this straight! Since you aren't gonna be involved, the reward split is 8 to 1 to 1!
Are you sure about just getting the 1 part, Lucy?
I'm the 8!
And then...
Shirotsume Town.
I'm never riding a carriage again.
You say that every time.
Anyway, let's get something to eat.
How about you eat your own fire?
You really are cold-hearted, you know.
Would you eat Plue or that cow of yours?
Of course not!
Well, it's the same as that.
So you're saying you can't eat your own fire then, right?
What a pain.
Let's go in here!
You two go on ahead.
What's with her?
It'd be more fun to all eat together.
Aye.
Let's bring the fatty parts to Lucy!
She looks like she likes the fatty parts.
Since when did you decide I liked fatty foods?
Lu...cy?
It's true. I look good in anything, don't I?
Have you finished with your meal, Master?
What are we going to do?
We were just joking, but she's really gone and done it!
Can't tell her it was just a joke now, can we?
M-Maybe we could just go for it like this?
I can hear you!
I am the client, Kaby Melon.
Melon?!
You have one yummy name!
Hey, that's rude of you!
I get that all the time.
I've heard that name somewhere before...
Well then, let me tell you about this job.
Right!
My request is to destroy a book in the possession of Duke Everlue, Daybreak.
Or burning it is fine, too.
Burning it?
Then why don't I just burn down the whole mansion?
Piece of cake!
You can't! You'll get thrown in jail for sure!
I'd like to know the reason...
Who cares? It's 200,000!
No, it's 2,000,000 jewel.
2-2,000,000?!
Oh, you weren't aware?
2,000,000 divided by three is...
Whoa, I can't even do the math!
It's simple!
I get 1,000,000, Natsu gets 1,000,000, and Lucy gets the rest!
Good thinking, Happy!
Aye!
There's none left for me!
But, why?
I want to destroy that book no matter what.
I cannot allow that book to exist.
Okay, I'm all pumped up!
Let's go, Lucy!
Aye!
Hey!
Daybreak...
It is a book that must be erased from this world.
Duke Everlue's Residence.
I've come because I heard you were recruiting maids!
Is anybody home?
Get the attention of some perverted old man, burn some book, get 2,000,000.
It'll be a cinch.
Break a leg!
You can do it!
A maid recruit?
Yes!
It seems you came because of the advertisement our Master placed for maids.
Did you call for me?
There he is!
Let's see here.
Thanks for having me!
I'm breaking out in goosebumps!
Gotta bear it!
No thanks. Go home, ugly.
That's that.
Go on home, ugly.
Understand?
For a person as magnificent as myself...
Oh, Master...
You're so wonderful...
Master, you're super cool!
Ugly, go home now,'kay?
So much for sex appeal.
That's not the problem!
That Everlue guy just has a really whacked out sense of beauty!
Excuses.
It's so frustrating!
Okay! In that case we'll go with Plan T!
Yeah! I'll never forgive that old fart!
Wait, what's Plan T?
The T is for Take them head-on!
How exactly is that a plan?
More foolish wizards have shown up.
Haven't they learned their lesson?
They're from Fairy Tail this time?
Safe and sound.
Thanks, Happy!
Aye!
Sheesh...
What part of take them head-on don't you get?
We should have just busted through the front gate!
No way! If we're careless the army will show up!
What's with you?
Didn't you say you'd never forgive that guy?
Indeed, he'll get what's coming to him.
Not only am I gonna burn that book, I'm gonna hide his shoes or something!
Whoa, how petty.
Aye...
Hmm, this seems to be a storeroom.
Look, look!
Lookin' good, Happy.
Wait, you plan on searching through each room?
Of course.
Wouldn't it be faster to grab someone and ask them where the book it?
Aye!
We're infiltrating without anyone finding out.
It's all ninja and stuff, isn't it cool?
Ninja?
I think he's got some weird mental image again...
The intruders have been located!
Eliminating them!
They're here!
It's a ghost!
You're annoying!
Flying Virgo Attack!
Hey, take that off already.
Ninja!
We can't have them discovering us-de gozaru!
Nin-nin!
Nin-nin!
It's cause we were just as noisy as usual.
It's a mountain of books-de gozaru!
Aye! -de gozaru.
That old man's actually quite a reader, I guess.
Let's search!
Aye, sir!
We have to find 1 book in all of these?
I found a porno!
An encyclopedia of fish!
I found the golden book!
And hey, search seriously!
Daybreak?
Like, dawn?
We found it!
Seriously?
What an easy 2,000,000.
Let's burn it!
Pretty simple, wasn't it?
Wait a sec!
But, this was written by Kemu Zaleon!
Kemu?
He's a wizard who was also a novelist!
I'm a huge fan!
I thought I'd read every book he wrote, but maybe this is an unpublished work?
Whatever, let's hurry and burn it.
What are you talking about? This is important cultural heritage!
Burning it is out of the question!
You're abandoning the mission.
Didn't I say I was a huge fan?
Let's just burn'em both.
How about we tell him that we burned it, and I keep it...
I don't like lying.
Aye.
I see, I see.
So you intruders are after Daybreak, are you?
See, this is what you get for hesitating.
Sorry.
What have you done to your mansion's floor?
I thought that you wizards were all coming to search for something,
and it turns out it was that stupid book!
Stupid?
A book that the client wanted destroyed for 2,000,000 jewel.
And even the person keeping it, Everlue, calls it stupid?
So wait... It's okay if I take it?
No! What's mine is mine!
Miser.
Shut up, ugly.
Then how about we burn it?
No! I won't let you!
Lucy, this is our job!
At least let me read it!
Right here?!
Enough nonsense! Do you realize who I am? Get your filthy hands off my book!
Vanish Brothers!
Good afternoon.
Even mother would be surprised to see these two brats are Fairy Tail wizards.
That mark! They're from the mercenary guild, the South Wolves!
So you hired these guys?
This...
Wolves are always hungry, yes?
Prepare yourselves.
Natsu, buy me some time.
I think there's some secret to this book.
Secret?
I didn't notice myself.
Maybe there's some treasure map hidden in it?
I'll go after the girl! Eliminate the brat!
Yes, sir.
Happy, take care of Lucy.
I'll back you up!
No...
I'll be fine on my own.
Hey! I'm tellin' mother on you!
Calm yourself. Cool down.
Come on, fire wizard.
Huh? How'd you know?
Fire was wrapping your legs when you defeated Virgo.
There's no mistaking it; you are an ability-type fire wizard.
Speaking of which, Ability-type means someone like Natsu who uses magic on their own body.
Someone like Lucy who uses items for magic is called a Holder-type.
So, I guess you're all prepared for this, huh?
I'll burn you to a smoldering crisp!
Sorry to say this, but we are especially skilled against fire wizards.
You might be from Fairy Tail, but in the end you're just a wizard.
You're no match for professional fighters like us mercenaries.
So that's all you got?
Brother, he's talking trash to us!
Do you know what a wizard's weakness is?
You mean transportation?
I think that might just be a personal issue you have...
He's totally talking trash to us!
Their weakness is their bodies!
To train oneself in magic takes discipline of mental focus!
And as a result you end up lacking the training of your body.
In other words, against people like us who train our bodies daily...
you can't match our power and speed.
Whoa, so scary!
So, when are you going to get serious?
Brother, do the combination attack!
Okay!
Finishing Move: Destruction of Heaven and Earth!
Bring it!
These are wind-reader glasses.
A magic item that allows you to read books extremely quickly.
I can't believe this book contains such a secret.
What did you find?
Tell me the secret to my book!
You're the lowest of the low!
You're an enemy of literature!
Face toward heaven and...
Face the earth and...
This is the Vanish Brother's combination attack.
Finishing Move: Destruction of Heaven and Earth.
There is no one that can survive this atta-
What were you saying about surviving that attack?
No way!
I'll blow you away with this!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Here comes the fire magic!
It's over!
Flame Cooking!
Suck up all the flames, transform it, and spew it back!
It's a Fairy barbecue!
Goodbye.
I can't believe this!
Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up!
Didn't you hear me?
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
Crap, I think I overdid it.
Boyoyoyoyoyo! It's Mira!
Mira-san, what's gotten into you?
Isn't it novel?
I thought it'd be a new fad in Fairy Tail.
No, there's no way, no how.
You sure? I thought it sounded cute.
Look, see Lucy?
Boyoyoyoyoyo!
Never move like that again!
Next time: Dear Kaby.
Stayed tuned for more Boyoyoyoyo next time on Fairy Tail!
I feel a sudden chill...
