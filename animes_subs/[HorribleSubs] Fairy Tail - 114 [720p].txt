As long as I have the power to protect my friends, that's all I need.
If I could trade for that power, I wouldn't care how weak I was.
I guess... that's contradictory.
You are an interesting one.
I wish I could fight you fair and square.
What do you mean?
I mean that time is up.
Each side presses the other as the battle on Tenroujima continues.
Bluenote appeared before Natsu's group.
He's not one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory, but the second-in-command!
The odds were stacked higher and higher against Fairy Tail.
But then Fried, Bickslow, and Gildarts came running back.
Fairy Tail started to gain some momentum.
But then something happened on Tenroujima that no one could have even imagined...
The land where Fairy Tail's founding master rests...
What future could Mavis's will illuminate for Fairy Tail?
Damn it...
What the hell is happening?
P-Power... I can't gather any strength...
All the energy from my body is being drained suddenly...
What in the world is happening?
Cana? Cana!
Hey, answer me!
I'm... so weak...
I can't keep... my eyes open...
This is strange...
Even though I secretly ate some fish just a little while ago...
I'm beat... I think I'm done...
Happy!
Could... this be...?
Our magic power?
What was that shaking before?
Azuma, I suppose.
My strength... It's being drained.
Sounds like he felled the Tenrou Tree.
He's stealing the magic power from all the people with the mark of Fairy Tail.
What?
What the hell is happening?
I suspect this was an order from Master Hades.
Why am I helping her?
I don't really know myself.
Erza vs. Azuma!
You fiend!
I have control over the island's magic power, but have left yours alone.
Now, Titania.
All around the island, your comrades are facing certain death.
You shall show me just how great this power to protect your friends is.
You called yourself Azuma, one of the 7 Kings of Purgatory, yes?
Why did you do this?
It was Master Hades's orders.
He told us to get rid of every Fairy Tail wizard, without exception.
No!
Why is it that you purposefully left me free to act?
I told you why.
I want to fight you seriously.
That's all.
If that is the truth you speak,
then the moment I defeat you, you will return everyone's power!
That, I promise.
Honestly, this is not how I would prefer to do things.
But that's only if you win, of course.
My friends' lives lie in the balance!
I assure you, I...
Requip! Heaven's Wheel Armor!
Heaven's Wheel!
Blumenblatt!
Folium Sica!
Ramus Sica!
This is not the Titania I was expecting.
I told you to come at me with all you've got!
She's fast...
Is that the Soaring Armor I've heard about?
However...!
The Adamantine Armor.
Ultimate defense.
That's the one that defended against a direct hit from the Magic Focusing Cannon, Jupiter.
Excellent...
But can it defend against this?
I know that one, too.
The Thunder Empress Armor.
I see now. Your magic power does justice to your name, Titania.
Quick Requipping, and flawless swordsmanship.
I'm impressed. This is quite enjoyable.
So this is Great Tree Ark magic...
This will be a challenge.
I see! It seems you are not just all talk.
You aren't obessed about people's strength for nothing.
Will you fight me at full strength now?
But that won't be enough to stop me!
Her magic power's increasing?!
I can't break through even with the magic power of the Purgatory Armor?
You seem to have overestimated your armor's power.
You were completely unguarded from below!
Tower Burst!
This man... What incredible magic power!
He is truly strong.
The Fairy's Armor is still damaged...
And I don't have any other armor that'll be a match for him.
What'll I do?
Now that I think about it...
I bought that Seduction Armor last week.
With that, I might...
I refuse!
I'm not Lucy, damn it!
Talking to yourself?
So then, what should I do?
To overcome his magic power, I have to collect all of mine and focus it into an attack.
I can't use any magic power for defense.
Therefore, I won't use any defense!
I will concentrate all of my magic into my sword!
A sword you can't even grip unless you discard all defense...
Behold, the Fairy Sword, Benizakura!
My defeat means defeat for the guild!
This will be my last stand!
Come, Titania!
I cannot lose!
This is for the guild!
I will put everything into this one attack!
What?!
Release the magic power of Tenrou that sleeps in the great land!
I can't move... Curses!
The cries of the great land...
Terra Clamare!
Titania... defeated.
Erza...
The Tenrou Tree has been destroyed by Azuma.
Because of that, the divine protection that should be given
to all who bear the mark of Fairy Tail has disappeared.
In fact, their magic power is being drained.
Fried and Gildarts are no exceptions.
The fate of the guild lies now on the shoulders of one person, Erza!
Can anyone move?
It's no use. I don't know why, but my magic power is draining out of me!
I'm dizzy...
Does it have something to do with the tree on the center of the island falling?
What'll we do? Cana's completely lost consciousness.
Can we still make it to the camp somehow?
Things aren't good over here, either.
Gramps's breathing has gotten weaker...
Damn it... What's happening?
Is everyone else safe?
Did you say something, Siegrain-sama?
Idiot! He's Jellal!
That's the real identity of the former council member, Siegrain!
Sorry, old habit.
He destroyed our Magic Council!
He's a villain who made people lose all confidence in us!
Hey... You think he's casting a spell or something?
He's in a cage made of magic sealing stone.
He can't use magic of any kind.
Want to test him?
W-With what?
See, look!
He's Jellal, but he can't do anything!
C-Come on, Nadal... Stop.
What have you been muttering to yourself?
Now that I think about it, we haven't been giving you much food lately.
You hungry or something?
Fine. Try saying, Please give me food, Nadal-sama...
Ask nicely, and I'll allow you to eat.
Hey!
And if you don't, then no meals for a week!
Er...za...
Don't lose...
Don't lose... Erza...
I-Impossible!
You were hit with a massive amount of Tenroujima's magic power!
Did I just hear Jellal's voice?
That can't be...
Don't be weak... He's no longer here.
Don't be misled by emotions...
Center your mind!
I will stand up, to protect everyone!
Frightening...
Do I lack the footwork?
I don't know whether I'll be able to win with the magic power I have.
But the difference in weight he and I carry is great.
Just as he says, right now, everyone's lives are riding on me.
I must protect them...
The guild... My friends!
For their sake, I will win!
You're so formidable that my heart is racing!
Fairy Tail's Titania, Erza Scarlet!
I am sure not to forget your name, as long as I live.
Curses!
Let's name you Erza Scarlet!
Scarlet. The color of your hair.
That way, I'll never forget.
Move!
It was the color of your hair.
Move!!
This is the end!
Have another taste of the magic power of Tenroujima!
Terra Clamare!
Erza?
Is this... the end?
Giving up?
Jellal...
Erza.
Everyone?
I see...
So, that's how it is...
I apologize.
I'd forgotten one crucial thing...
I am not protecting everyone!
T-This is...
It is I... who is always... being protected!
Tenroujima's magic power that I should have under control is protecting Erza?
Trust... Bonds...
Her true strength...
It is not One, but Many!
What an amazing guild!
Excellent.
Natsu, have you seen Gray?
Nope, I haven't.
Now that I think about it, haven't seen Juvia either. What're they doing?
Gray and Juvia? Don't tell me...
They lllike each other!
Hey, calm down a bit, it's not that exciting.
Next time: Frozen Spirit.
And besides, wasn't Juvia with Erza?
Well, that's boring.
What do you want to happen to Gray, exactly?
