We're unstoppable!
It's because we're Fairy Tail, see?!
I need to think a bit-kabo...
Alexei-sama...
Here's the list of battle matches...
This match-up...
The management is well-informed.
Shall we begin?
For the sake of our true purpose...
And now, I'll announce
the current standings of the third day of the Grand Magic Games!
As before, Raven Tail is in first place!
The time has come at last...
Move out, people.
Still in second place, Lamia Scale!
In third place, one rank down, Sabertooth!
In fourth place, Mermaid Heel!
And tied for fourth,
moving up two ranks, the Fairy Tail A team!
Alright!
We're gonna move up even more ranks!
Aye, sir!
In sixth place, the Fairy Tail B team!
We ain't gonna lose either!
And you can see the last place teams for yourself.
I guess when you're in seventh place, you don't even get a name check...
Humiliating parfum!
If Quatro Puppy's gonna be our name, I'm glad he didn't say it!
Laxus vs. Alexei!
Alright, the battle part of the third day of the Grand Magic Games is about to begin!
I'm looking forward to the battle part!
Indeed.
In the first match, it's Millianna of Mermaid Heel...
Our souls are always Wild...
Let the match begin!
Victory goes to the swiftest!
Wild Spin!
Oh, my! It's a body attack, using his giant body to spin around!
I'll use magic to slow him down!
Cat Binding Tube!
It bounced right off!
Millianna!
Attaboy!
Our souls are always Wild...
Keep it up and you'll win!
I'm not done yet!
Wild...
Kitten Blast!
That spurred my spinning on even more! Now take this!
Beat her with one shot!
Our souls are always Wild...
I hope Millianna's okay...
She's taken a lot of damage.
Erza...
She's fine.
Millianna would never lose over a few bruises like this.
Millianna!
Hang in there!
There's someone Millianna needs to defeat.
Until she brings him down, she won't lose.
If I can't beat a guy like this, I better pack it in...
There'd be no point in joining Mermaid Heel!
Time to end this!
Wild Spin, twice as fast!
Uh-oh! Is this gonna decide the match?!
Cat Binding Tube!
I'll tear this junk right off!
I'm not letting go, no matter what!
W-W-Wild...
That ain't wild at all!
Feelin' spiffy!
Semas is down for the count!
The winner is Millianna!
Kagura-chan! Risley-chan! I won!
Now that was an interesting battle!
And she used various kinds of magic. I learned something.
You've improved, Millianna.
Even though getting bound by that tube
wouldn't draw a score on that magic-measuring device from before...
Bound...?
It was rough for me when I went up against her a long time ago, too.
I hate Jellal, too...
Next, the second match for the battle part!
From Sabertooth, the minstrel who sings to the red moon...
Rufus Lohr!
Versus Holy Night Eve of Blue Pegasus...
Eve Tilm!
Eve-kun, the parfum of victory!
Do your best!
Fight, Eve!
These two clashed during the competition of the first day,
and now they'll collide in battle on the third day!
Snow Magic: White Fury!
That's your memory of where I was standing.
I already experienced your skill during Hidden.
And I remember it well!
You remember it, eh?
Eh?
S-Sensei! What are you doing here?!
That's your memory.
Eve's got a memory like that?!
What are you doing, Senpai?!
I don't remember that parfum! Men!
A star falls on the night!
A direct hit on Eve!
Or so we thought, but it was just a copy made of snow!
A brilliant parfum!
That's the way, Eve!
Keep it up!
Eve-kun was originally a member of the Council, wasn't he?
That's right.
He was a Rune Knight of the Enforcement and Detention Corps like the rest of us.
Yes, even back then, he was a shining light,
but after entering a guild, his magic has become even more polished.
White Blizzard!
You waste your time.
I don't think so.
I'm using White Blizzard to search for the location of your real body!
Over there! White Fang!
I remember that magic.
Memory Make.
There it is...
What kind of Molding Magic is that?!
Magic that gives form to memories?
That's...
In other words, Ancient Magic.
So there's more to this than meets the eye, huh?
Oh, boy! W-What is...?
It's getting kind of hot out here...
I'm sensing the rise of a tremendous magic power...
Rage of the Burning Earth!
The match is over!
Eve fought a good fight, but he fell short of Rufus!
The winner is Rufus of Sabertooth!
He really is strong!
Memory Molding...
It's my job to beat him.
How could Eve lose like that? Crap...
Still, he really did do his best...
Meister...
We've really fallen hard in the rankings...
Like a flower's parfum, be at ease, men.
We still have a secret weapon.
We have a secret weapon.
It's so important that I said it twice.
So we've learned.
At any rate, I wonder who that rabbit really is...
If he won't even tell us...
Don't tell me it's not even a member of our guild?
That'd be against the rules!
Moving right along, let's begin the third match-kabo!
From the Fairy Tail B team, Laxus Dreyar!
Versus Alexei of Raven Tail!
It's Laxus!
His opponent is from Ivan's guild...
Good luck, Laxus!
I'm sure you got nothin' to worry about.
We're talking about Laxus here...
But... Juvia's got a bad feeling about this...
There's been bad blood between father and son guilds since day one, right, Yajima-san?
Lahar-kun, you brought along people from the Corps, right?
Yes. A few.
Because of regulations...
Keep a close eye on Raven Tail.
If there's any skulduggery, stop the match immediately.
Right.
Warren...
Roger!
This is HQ! Bisca, can you hear me?
What do you mean HQ, Warren?
No movement from Master Ivan. Go ahead.
Roger!
Team Raijinshuu plus Lisanna...
How'bout you?
This is Raijinshuu plus Lisanna.
Currently, there are no conspicuous movements from Raven Tail.
I'm not gonna let you do any funny business like that first day, Crow-chan!
Just try to tarnish Laxus's valor.
The Raijinshuu won't guarantee your lives.
Ever says she wants to go back by Elfman...
Please grant her permission.
I said no such thing!
Ivan...
I won't let you pull any more cowardly stunts.
Is something wrong, First Master?
No, nothing.
Doing everything in your power to protect your comrades...
And just a little bit of enjoying the circumstances...
It's splendid.
The ultimate form of my aspirations
is right before my eyes.
Don't forget this, Third Master.
Um... Or is it sixth?
I appreciate the kind words.
And it's actually the seventh...
Sixth is right!
Get a grip!
Both of you, step forward!
Let the match begin!
So you're in my old man's guild?
Who the hell are you, anyway...?
This guy...
How...?
You gotta be kiddin' me!
He's getting his ass kicked?
I don't believe it... Laxus?!
W-What's going on?
Who the hell is that masked freak?!
No way! Laxus...?!
My goodness... Alexei keeps pouring it on!
Laxus can't even lift a finger!
What the hell is this?
A kind of Hallucination Magic.
Everyone around us
is talking about this right now. They can't see our true bodies.
They can't hear us either.
What they see are phantoms fighting.
It looks real, doesn't it?
Not one person realizes it's an illusion.
The crowd is watching images of the mighty Laxus as helpless as a baby.
Why is Laxus on the ropes like this?!
Bisca!
Ivan isn't doing anything!
Raijinshuu plus Lisanna!
I don't think they're doing anything crooked over here either!
This is unbelievable! Laxus! It's time to get serious!
Dammit...
Laxus! What's wrong?!
It seems that even your guild idolizes you.
I wonder how your compatriots feel while watching this...
Laxus!
Hey, come on...
I've got no idea what this is about.
About?
What's the point of winning an illusory battle?
Exactly.
Our goal isn't victory.
This hallucination is just camouflage.
An illusion is an illusion.
The end result can be altered as we like.
End result, you say?
Laxus!
Go, Laxus!
Hang in there!
Oh, my! Laxus has begun to counterattack!
That's how you do it! Go, Laxus!
Go! Do your best!
Alright! Go!
Easy win!
I figured he'd be okay.
Yeah...
Yes! That ought to settle it!
Yeah!
It looks like we were worried for nothing.
Warren!
Right!
Good job, Bisca.
Thanks.
Raijinshuu plus Lisanna...
In the end, they didn't do anything, huh?
I was a fool for worrying about Laxus even for a moment!
What?!
Laxus!
Uh-oh! The tables are turned again!
Is this the end of Laxus's counterattack?!
Laxus!
What the hell is going on here?!
Is this the end result you were talkin' about?
Depending on your negotiations with us,
it's possible that we would even let you win this.
We've got nothing to talk about.
The illusions don't mean a damn thing.
I'm gonna finish this by taking out your real self right here and now.
That's impossible!
Reality is harsh.
Not even you can defeat Raven Tail's elite all at the same time.
And there's one more thing.
You know how strong I am, don't you...
I figured as much...
Makarov would die before he coughed it up.
But you're different.
Would you tell us?
The location of Lumen Histoire!
What are you talking about?
You don't have to play dumb.
I'm sure Makarov has told you.
Actually, I don't know.
No. You must know.
Well, even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
Come, come...
You're in a hopeless situation, but I'm willing to let you win.
Although if you don't accept the condition...
Jeez, you're a real pain in the ass.
I can understand why Gramps washed his hands of you.
Bring it on.
See, the master's enemies are my enemies!
Apparently, you need to be taught a lesson...
What happened to Laxus?!
Those guys aren't using another underhanded trick, are they?
Everyone's keepin' a close watch on them, so it's gotta be okay.
Maybe he feels really sick...
Like he ate too much at last night's banquet and now his stomach is upset?
Or he drank too much...
I bet there's somethin' on his mind!
Like he's lonely'cause he's got almost no friends...
Next time: Wendy vs. Cheria!
I know what it is!
What?
He must be exhausted...
