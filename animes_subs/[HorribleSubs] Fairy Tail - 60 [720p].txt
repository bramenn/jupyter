The Alliance of Official Guilds vs. Oracion Seis!
During that fierce battle, Jellal was resurrected!
I'm sorry...
Erza, now recovered, goes and disappears...
And the seal locking away Nirvana has been unlocked!
I'm sorry...
If it's love and dreams and you it'll become magical.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
I kind of admired this powerful world,
chock-full of problems.
Frozen time has started to move again
ever since I met you.
Why were we born? Why do we live?
I don't need any complicated answers.
Laugh! Cry! Be honest with yourself.
Simple feelings are the most important.
You can change those tears shed on sad nights into strength.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
Erza and Jellal have finally reunited deep inside of the Worth Woodsea.
But Jellal has lost his memories.
Jellal is trying to free Erza of her hatred
by using self-destruction magic circles to destroy both Nirvana and himself.
However, Erza...
Jellal!
So you're gonna take the cancellation code for the magic circles to the grave with you?
I will not allow it! I won't allow you to die like this!
You have sins to repent for!
Remember! Do you think you'll be at peace knowing nothing?
Live, and struggle!
Jellal!
March of Destruction!
Erza...
Why... are you crying?
You are so kind...
Jellal! You have to stay awake!
What is the meaning of this?
Brain.
A self-destruction magic circle?
Jellal constructed it, that bastard!
This is bad! At this rate, we'll have finally found Nirvana only to see it destroyed!
Worry not, Cobra.
I'm sure you know just why I have the codename Brain.
I was once a member of the Ministry of Magical Development.
During that time I used my knowledge to create hundreds of new spells.
One of them is the self-destruction magic circle.
And I was the one that taught you it.
Or have you forgotten, Jellal?
This area will do.
Concentrate. Do it exactly as I taught you.
Illustrate the destruction you desire from within your head...
I know.
And after only telling him once...
To be able to master the self-destruction magic circle to this level is impressive, as always.
It isn't enough...
What?
What I desire is perfect destruction that leaves not even a speck of dust remaining.
He's...
Using a self-destruction magic circle on your own body?
So you are planning on dying along with the cancellation code?
It seems his memories are screwed up, thanks to the effects of Ethernano.
Basically, he doesn't realize he's a bad guy.
What? Hilarious!
Even without the cancellation code...
No!
How pitiful, Jellal!
Nirvana will be mine!
Never!
Awaken, Nirvana!
Erza!
Reveal yourself!
I can hear it! Our future!
The sound of the extinction of the light!
Jellal!
Erza!
Carla, look!
No... It can't be...
Hot Eye-dono, what is that?
It has begun! The final stage... The resurrection of Nirvana!
Men!
What in the world is that?
We were too late?
What the...?!
Whoa there, that's...
I-I think we're in trouble...
Damn it! Erza was inside that light!
Oh, no!
I've never smelled anything so dangerous as this!
Hot Eye-dono... Can you see something?
Something... Something huge is coming, yes...
Something huge?
What in the world is this? I don't get it!
It's coming out of the ground around here!
So this is what Nirvana is?
Can you even call it magic at this point?
Whoa, the ground's shaking...
Does anyone hear cracking?
I have a really, really bad feeling about this...
No kidding.
I called it!
H-Hey! Hold it right there, you people!
Carla!
Let's go, Wendy!
Right!
Look, Carla!
That's...
That's...
Finally! Finally it is mine!
The ultimate weapon that will destroy the light!
The ultra-inversion magic, Nirvana!
The greatest weapons of the official guilds, their unity and trust...
Erza...
Undo the self-destruction magic you cast on your own body!
You have a duty to survive!
It's... all over...
What is over? Take a look.
Go, Fairy Tail!
You are the only ones who can stop this!
Carla, let's head over there!
Right!
Let's get up there as well!
Yes. Take my hand, please.
Helping each other, as allies!
This indeed is love! Yes...
We will not give up.
Our hopes are already connected.
We'll run up these and then bust up the main body!
By the way, why are you guys in matching outfits?
Don't ask me!
Live, and grab the future in front of you.
Jellal...
Let's go... Together...
Yes...
Men?
W-Where am I?
Where did those young whippersnappers run off to?
What's going on!?
Men!!
What do you think you're doing, Natsu?
Get it together already,'kay?
This thing's... You know, that...
That?
It's t-transportation, right?
It's moving, but it's not transportation!
Think of it like that!
Got it!
I-I'm gonna hurl...
These are octopus legs! You're okay riding animals, right?
There ain't any octopus in the forest...
Stop sweating the details!
Okay! I'm fine now!
Idiot! Don't let it get to you!
I know! Leave it to me!
Natsu!
Happy!
Aye!
Happy! Nice catch!
Man, that guy's gonna give me a heart attack...
That was too cool, my hero!
How about it, Natsu? Becoming the wind with me feels pretty good, huh?
Yeah! It's totally awesome!
You guys head to the top like that!
We're going inside that hole over there!
Right!
Aye, sir!
It's a city... And it looks really old.
I-I don't get it.
This smell...
It's his smell!
Finally, Brain! We've gotten Nirvana!
So this is a relic of the ancients?
Cubellios, this is pretty awesome!
Look, Cobra.
Look at the world spread out below me.
The city of the ancients...
That itself is the true identity of Nirvana!
While I stand here on the King's Summit, this city moves exactly as I will it!
Move? Are we making it go somewhere?
I'm aiming for a certain guild, you see...
Our first target?
Call it the first land to have its light extinguished.
Go forth, ancient city!
Change our darkness for the light!
I'm gonna stop ya!
It's you!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Cobra! Don't let him interfere!
Right! Cubellios!
You! I'll burn everything!
Thank you, Happy!
Aye...
Why, that...
What's that? The snake is flying!
Hey. I heard that you couldn't handle transportation...
Happy isn't transportation!
That's right!
I see.
So that's why you were already flying.
Because you aren't able to stand on Nirvana.
You're a riot, buddy.
That's none of your business, jerk!
Move it,'cause I'm stopping this big pile of junk!
Go ahead and try.
I won't let you get near Brain.
Brain?
So he's the one that's moving it?
Come, Dragon Slayer!
Comin' right at ya!
Aye!
A-Again and again...
He totally predicted your moves!
I can hear your movements!
What?
Yes, that's better. Let's play.
I'm sorry, Carla.
I shouldn't have pushed you...
Don't worry about me.
Anyway... What are you planning to do now that we're here?
Are you still chasing after Jellal?
No!
Wendy...
Well, maybe a little.
But I have to stop this thing, no matter what.
There's got to be something even I can do, right?
Yes, you're right...
What's the matter, Carla?
It couldn't be... This has to be a coincidence, right?
This shouldn't be...
What is wrong, Carla?
It's where we're heading...
Our guild, Caitshelter, is dead ahead, right in this thing's path!
Damn it! I can't hit him with anything!
I wonder what kind of magic he uses?
I have to finish this creep off quick, or I'll never be able to get at that guy!
Let's go, Happy... We'll kick both their asses and stop this huge pile of junk!
Aye!
Not gonna happen. You guys will never be able to crush our wish!
Now, I'm going to enjoy this...
Damn you! I'm getting fired up!
Natsu! It's a snake, but it has wings and is flying!
It's totally ripping off my character!
No, not really.
Whatever, just get him! Get him for ripping off my character!
Hold it... Wouldn't Carla be more of a rip-off?
Carla can rip me off all she wants.
Next time: Super Aerial Battle! Natsu vs. Cobra!
I think the snake's actually cooler. It has venom.
But I have fish!
And fish helps... how exactly?
