I want to go back to that time again.
I want to be small again. Minami-kun...
Where are you, Chiyomi?
Here, I'm here, Minami-kun!
You're in Tokyo?!
Hey, what are you thinking about?
So, I told you yesterday. About the dance workshop.
Please, I really want to do it.
So, please let me stay with you.
Wait a minute, what are you doing?
Minami-kun's father disappeared, right?
He made a lover and left us. I don't consider him my dad.
Idiot!
Never give up! Minami-kun!
Tsuki (kendo term)!
Tsuki ari. (Tsuki point)
You did it!
He did it.
Good, good, good.
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by My Little Lover Team@Viki.
I'm home.
Hello, I'm Chiyomi.
It's been two weeks since I became small like this.
I guess people get used to things whatever it is.
Little by little, I am getting used to the way I am.
What are you doing?
I think your handkerchief is so cute.
These patterns are cute.
Is it okay to repot it as it is?
Hey, would you give this to me? I could make a dress out of this...
Minami-kun, what are you doing?!
Well, it won't be good to keep this pot as it is. So I got this.
Ivy?
I suppose if the ivy covers the pot, I would feel comfortable for sure.
Ah, don't dig it up too much. That spot is...
Hmm?
Hm? No. Nothing.
How is it? Why don't you use it?
Eh? Well, if you say it like that... (I don't feel comfortable)
Alright.
Ah, that's my dad's cake.
Yup, your dad's cake is delicious.
It is delicious, isn't it?
Do you want to eat it?
Yeah, I would like to eat it...
Can't be helped. I'll share it with you.
Hey, Shunichi. Would you change the light bulb?
I'm coming now!
Bye.
I guess this one is better.
There are still some things I can't get used to. Because I am a girl afterall.
N I am not good at talking in similitudes N N So I can't do a good job telling a tale N
N But, I will tell you an amazing story of you and I N
N It is not a small story that will fit in a pocket N
N God played a trick N N And a dramatic time began N
N The shape of happiness you and I imagined N
N doesn't have a name N N But if it is a world I create with you, it's okay N
N I will write words that won't be erased like a magic N N and turn the page N
N It is like a sequel to a fairy tale N N We can smile forever N
N Let's imagine a story with a happy ending N
Please treat me well.
Ok.
Ok...
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Ouch.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Be careful!
No... Hmm?
Where is it?
Geez...
Did you wear it?
I can't. I can't get my head through.
I guess it didn't work after all.
Then, why don't you make Takagi do it?
He will be thrilled to make anything for you.
Huh?
He made a figurine that looked like you, and puts it in his pocket at school.
It's not manly. So gross.
Don't badmouth Riku.
I didn't badmouth.
Tomorrow, we can go buy your clothes after school.
No, that's okay.
But, you want a change of clothes, don't you?
Tomorrow, I will go to my house again.
What?
In my room, there are some doll clothes.
That'll be impossible.
Last time, I had to come up with such a lame excuse as the yearbook.
I am out of ideas.
No... I will go alone.
What? Alone?
Yup. While you are at school, I will go there a little bit.
A little bit? Come on.
You couldn't do that when I accompanied you. You won't be able to do it all by yourself.
That's rude.
Last time, I could have gotten them all by myself without you.
I don't care anymore. Why don't you go by yourself?
I don't care anymore.
Alright! I will get those cute clothes safely.
Ah, however,
if, by chance, I don't make it, please go buy clothes with me again.
Alright!
You got a mail? From Horikiri-shi?
Yeah, I got it. I got a movie too.
Amippe, I am sorry I left so suddenly.
How are you doing? I'm doing fine.
The Solo's Workshop is quite hard, but I've been doing my best.
I came up with some dance movements, so I am sending a movie to show them to you.
Here we go. Five, six, seven, eight.
No matter how early in the morning it is,
Up, down, up, down. And pose. Seven of us will do this.
Horikiri-shi seems to be doing fine. I am relieved.
RIght? She seems lively somewhat.
I envy her. I wanted to participate in the Solo's workshop, too.
Come on!
What would I do if you are gone too?
Eh?
Hey, would you forward the video to me?
Ah, yeah. Of course.
Why doesn't she mail me?
I heard her cellphone broke, so she might not know your address anymore.
But, then how did she send you a mail?
My address is really simple. It's amippeamippeamippe@ So, she must have figured it out.
Well, my address is rikurikuriku@ though.
Yeah...
Today, there is something I need to tell you before the class.
Lately, there are a lot of burglaries reported around here.
There are many senior citizens living around this area, you know.
In most of the cases, their houses are burglarized because they go out without locking doors.
So far, there are no witnesses.
If you see a suspicious person, you need to call the police, okay?
Wow, burglars.
No way... If we find one, let's beat him up.
As if.
If I catch one, am I going to be awarded?
You should never fight with the burglar.
You will never know what he will do if he is cornered.
Okay, let's start class now. Please go to page 78.
Minami-kun. We are having a class.
Ah, sorry.
Yes.
Oh, Sakaizawa.
Sensei (teacher). This is bad.
You need to confirm who it is by the intercom before opening the door.
I'll be fine.
We have this.
Hey, stop kidding around, Sensei.
So, what brings you here?
Ah, by chance, you want to invite me to another alumni reunion?
My goodness. I know you want to find someone to marry. But, aren't you having too many gatherings lately?
Even though I was your homeroom teacher, you don't have to invite me to every single one of them.
That's not it... although I do want to get married.
Well, actually, many people around here had their houses burglarised recently.
You are home alone during the day, right? So, I wanted to let you know.
Oh, is that it?
We will be okay. We don't have anything that would trouble us if stolen.
Well, even if you say so...
Oh, Sakaizawa-kun. I need to go shopping now.
Would you give me a ride on your bike?
What are you saying, Sensei. Double riding is no good, you know.
I am a police officer.
Burglar? This town used to be so peaceful.
I guess it would be okay. I guess it is time.
Here I come.
Great. It is open as I expected.
Oh no, oh no, oh no.
Hey, master.
Gan-chan, did you tell your wife that you would be here?
Hush! I came here to relax.
Don't say that.
I'm the one who gets in trouble.
Although I told Minami-kun I could do it...
But, it is really hard after all.
I made it finally.
This is like Mt. Everest. (She is saying'Chomolungma' which is Tibetan)
There it is!
This is great. It is still here like before.
There are so many.
So cute!
This and...
this...
I will take them.
I definitely need a hairbrush.
It's heavy. Did I pack too much? Oh, well, it'll be okay.
So heavy...
You were also against it, weren't you?
But, you shouldn't have hit her.
Don't say the same thing over and over again.
You are the one who are making me do that.
Come on, you two.
You are always like this. You sound like you hit Chiyomi for the sake of me. But, that's not true, is it?
Hey, let me tell you
Chiyomi didn't leave the house because I hit her. She wanted to participate in the workshop.
Regardless of whether I hit or not, she would have left anyway.
You are mistaken, Dad.
You always change the subject like that.
- Hey, let's stop it now, Ricchan. - Don't tell me. Tell HIM.
You always look disgusted like that.
- I don't. - Yes, you do. You have a look that says I shouldn't have married her.
You got a customer here, okay?
- That's not how I feel. - You look like that because you DO feel that way.
Sure. You always make me the bad guy like that.
You've always had a persecution complex to begin with.
You two, stop it! You are going way overboard.
Hey you!
I knew you would be here.
Oh no... she found me.
- We're going home. - Ouch, ouch.
You always sneak out when I am not looking.
Don't pull my ear.
Hey, my ear is about to get torn.
Okay.
Grandma is not back yet.
Oof.
What's wrong with those two?
Is it my fault?
Grandma is back. Oh no!
Oh, no. Oh, no.
It's not her?
Nobody is home.
Eh?

Actually, many people around here had their houses burglarized.
No way... A burglar?
What should I do? I have to tell Minami-kun.
I am happy I can study with you today again.
It can't be late though.
I know.
Nomura... you are tall.
Eh?
You like smaller girls better?
Eh? Well, no.
But, with your height, a girl of my height would look good next to you, balance-wise.
Sayori-chan!?
Masaya...
Oh, my hand...
You were okay. I'm relieved.
I have been worried about you since I couldn't get in touch with you at all.
- You know him? - Who the hell are you?
Hey, stay away from my girlfriend, you brat.
Stop it. We broke up, didn't we?
I'm not convinced. Broke up?
- We have been together - -Let go!
- for a long time- - Cut it out!
Oh? What's with you? Hey.
Huh?
Ouch, ouch. What are you doing?
What? I'm busy right now.
Nobody's home. I'm here all by myself.
It couldn't be helped. Since you didn't come, I had to do it.
No way. I'm this close.
I can't go home empty-handed.
I'm okay. I can do it all by myself.
I'm saying I'm okay! See you.
Give up already.
She hasn't gotten in touch with you because she wants to avoid you.
You should be old enough to realize that.
She is avoiding me...?
Is that right, Sayori-chan?
I have a boyfriend now, so...
I don't have time to play with you.
Is the boyfriend...
That- that-
Yes.
We promised to get married in the future as well.
Right, Minami-kun?
What?
Oh. Yeah.
If you follow her around again, I will report you as a stalker.
Stalker?
Don't kid me, you brat!
Hey!
You will regret this!
Give it back.
Oh, no. This is bad.
A b-u-r-g-l-a-r
Thank you for protecting me.
I was so happy.
Earlier,
I said such a thing out of a whim.
But I'm serious.
What?
I am seriously thinking about my future with you...
Well, I'm willing if it is you.
Minami-kun,
what do you think of me?
What do I think?
I don't care.
Send!
Sorry. Wait a minute.
Oh, no. What shall I do?
What is it?
Sorry. I have to go.
-Wait! Minami-kun! -Sorry!
What is it?
I am busy right now. I will talk to you later.
What?
You are here?
Really?
I got a cramp. Ouch.
Hey. What are you doing?
- Why did you come? - Let's stop doing this.
- This kind of thing? - This kind of thing like a burglary.
What?
Her accomplice is here?
- I'm not doing this because I want to. - So, I'm telling you,
I will do it right.
What do you mean?
- See? You can't say anything. - Anyway,
you are not in a normal condition now.
Let's go home.
You are right.
I'm not in a normal condition.
But, who's fault is that?
Your fault, isn't it?
You swindler. It's your fault.
So, I'm telling you...
A swindler?
She is not pick it up.
Grandma isn't home?
Chiyomi!
Let's go home.
Let go of me.
Hey.
Hey, Kanae. You can't do this.
My goodness.
Hey.
- We're going home. - No way.
- What if someone comes home, what shall we do? - We'll be fine.
I haven't found it yet.
What should I do? What should I do?
What should I do? They'll be here.
Ah.
That's it.
- It might be here. - Please stop it, Kanae.
We are going home.
It might be upstairs.
It probably is not upstairs.
Don't do it.
This is no good.
Kanae. We'll be in trouble.
Oh no...
Let's get out of here! Quickly! Let's go!
Oh no...
There was someone there after all.
I did it!
Quickly, quickly!
What are we gonna do if we are caught?
This happened because you are so undependable.
Are you sure you sent her the divorce paper?
I sure did. When I called her the other day, she said she already signed it.
Why didn't you send it to her sooner?
That was...
Maybe your wife is telling a lie?
Maybe she didn't sign it and threw it away?
Emiko is not that kind of a woman.
Gosh!
K-Kanae.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. That's wrong. That's not what I meant.
I'm sorry. Kanae.
You are mistaken.
Grandma!
What's the matter? Why are you so out of breath?
Oh, so you were here.
You know,
I heard at school that there has been a burglar around here.
I was worried.
We are fine.
That's good.
Chiyomi!
Minami-kun!
You are home!
I'm so relieved.
Chiyomi,
so you were safe, huh.
Minami-kun.
So, I climbed the stairs vigorously.
Then, I mailed you and was almost spotted by them several times.
So, the burglars didn't come to this room?
Right. The female burglar momentarily stepped in here, then her accomplice came.
An accomplice?
Right. I didn't see his face,
but he must be a useless guy.
He was indecisive for a burglar.
They started to have a lovers' fight.
So when I played a CD in loud volume,
they ran away in a hurry.
That's strange.
Grandma said we didn't get burglarized.
Grandma was not home, you know.
But, still...
That is strange.
They were in such a hurry to go out.
Onee-chan (big sister), I am borrowing it a bit.
Is this it?
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by My Little Lover Team@Viki.
Eh?
Why is this here?
The one who hid this... was onii-chan (big bro).
The doll's clothes onee-chan had hid...Onii-chan?
Eh? For what?
Thank you for making you wait. This is Solo Workshop office.
I am a friend of Horikiri Chiyomi who is participating in the workshop now.
Horikiri-san?
Yes, I can't get in touch with her because her cellphone broke or something.
If possible, would you please...
- It's Horikiri-san, right? - Yes. - Horikiri...
It's Horikiri Chiyomi.
Oh? We don't seem have a person named Horikiri-san at our workshop.
No way. It's Horikiri Chiyomi. Chiyomi.
Right. We don't have Horikiri-san or Chiyomi-san.
Oh, is that right. I see.
Thank you very much. Bye.
I'm so relieved a burglar got caught.
Yazawa-kun and Utsumi-kun were patrolling in the neighborhood,
and they caught him and reported it to the police.
Were there two burglars? A man and a female?
No, it was a young man in his 20's.
Junichi, why did you think there were a male and a female burglers?
Ah... I just thought about it for some reason.
It is scary.
Hey you.
Mom.
Noboru...!
It's been a while.
It seems you are doing well.
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to see you.
Go away.
How in the world could you come here now?
Do you know how much Emi-chan and Shunichi -
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
But Mom, I just wanted to -
As for me,
I don't have a son.
Go away.
Go away!
- Go away. Go away. - I'm sorry.
Go away! Go away!!
Hey, look.
What do you think? Do I look good in this?
I think so.
Then, how about this?
I don't see the difference.
Aren't you going to eat the cake?
I don't need it now. I will gain weight if I eat it before going to bed.
Then, I will eat it up.
Go ahead.
Oh? Did I gain weight?
Oh, right. I brought this too.
Cute!
I am glad I brought this here.
It's cute. It's cute!
N If I want to tell you something,N
I want to get back to the way I was as soon as possible. I still feel the same way,
but sometimes I wish the time would stop (so that I can stay like this.)
Only sometimes, though.
N I hope this moment, which we call happinessN
N will continue foreverN
N Actually, I knowN
N that forever doesn't exist anywhere N
N It is a sweet and small story that spreads in my heartN
N A casual encounter N

N Everyday, I was with you N
N I was slowly loving you more and more N
N When we walk shoulder to shoulder N
N You are right here, but even if I stretched my arm N
N I won't be able to reach you N

N It almost hurts me N N Forever N
N I just want to be honest and tell you that I love you N
N Forever and ever N N Please be with me N

N Forever N
Preview Minami-kun, I will protect you.
You know how I feel about you, right?
Asuka-chan, it's not right that a girl comes into a man's room.
I don't mind. I don't mind if you do it to me, onii-chan.
A group blind date?
Why are you crying?
It's nothing!
Hey, get me out of here!
Chiyomi!
- Minami-kun! - Don't worry about it.
No way!!
Onii-chan is a perv?
