Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Sorry, everybody
What do you mean, Sorry, everybody”?
You won, you idiot
Thank you!
Thanks to you, Kenny had fun fighting!
It was a long time since I saw Kenny having so much fun!
Thank you so much!
Here we go
Ichigo If you can, please dont die.
And if you can, please play with Kenny again, will you?
Please
The soundshave stopped.
Do you think Ichigo is all right?
Weve come this far.
We have no choice but to believe in him.
Thats true, but
This is no time to get distracted. Its our turn now.
Were going to jump across. Are you ready, Hana?
Yes.
Here we go!
Im counting on you!
That was dangerous!
Sorry
The sounds have stopped
And the Spiritual Pressure is gone.
Both of them
Which of them died?
I dont know.
The diffused reflection of the Sekki-Seki is causing
the traces of Spiritual Pressure to be wiped away.
Why?
There should be no good reason that blood is spilled for my sake.
Please tell me
Kaien
There now
That should do it! It should be fine now.
Umm
Huh?
You tied up my arms, too.
Oh, sorry bout that.
Oh, its too much trouble!
Hana, you can just fly with it!
Hold it
Stop it! My arms are going to tear off!
This is impossible!
I'm sorry, Ichigo. I'm a little late
Youve been beat up good.
But with Kenpachi Zaraki as your foe, you could not have expected less.
Taking him out in the process was quite an achievement.
But, I must say, you fought well.
You endured well. I am impressed.
Do not worry.
I will not allow you to die.
Whered you come fromkid?
Thats a sword. Arent you scared?
Its a tool for killing people.
Kid Whats your name?
You dont have one?
I dont, either.
Oh!
Yachiru
Hurray! Hurray! Kennys up!
Yahoo!
What about that guy?
Huh?
I called for Unohana. Shell be here soon.
What about him?
I dont know. I dont think hes dead.
Thats good
This way, I can pay him back.
Theres nothing to pay him back for.
Sure there is! I lost.
You didnt lose, Kenny!
You idiot! Whats with that look on your face?
But you didnt lose!
Ichigo said, Zangetsu and I the two of us are fighting together.”
It was two against one! You won, Kenny!
Dont laugh like that!
Fighting together with your Zanpaku-to?
Yachiru
Hmm?
You remember that time I gave you your name?
Of course!
I even remember how many clouds there were in the sky!
Yeah Me, too.
K-Kenny?
Be quiet
Id forgotten for a long time
How painful it is, having no name.
Everyone else would be called by name, but I didnt have one.
That feeling
It is read Yachiru.” Its the name
of the one person I wish to be like.
Ill give it to you.
Yachiru
Im Kenpachi.
Its the name given to the mightiest Soul Reaper
in every generation.
I will take that name starting today.
Ive kept you waiting for such a long time.
You might think, What the heck, after all these years,”
butdo you think you could tell me now
what your name is?
No good, huh?
I want to get stronger.
I found someone to fight.
I can get stronger. I want to fight!
I want to get stronger!
Its been a long time since Ive felt like this.
I want to get stronger!
I had no name, and no parents.
Where I was, was North Rukongai, Area 79, known as Kusajishi.
I have no memory of seeing anything there,
other than the color of blood.
Everyone around me was closer to beast than human.
A baby like me could have been stomped to death at any time.
Then, you came along.
From North Rukongai, Area 80, Zaraki.
From the very depths of darkness,
you carved up my bloody world in an instant,
andyou gave me a name.
If you hadnt appeared, I would not be here today.
Yes. Since that day, you have been my entire world.
You can do it, Kenny
You are the strongest, Kenny!
So, lets get stronger and stronger together!
Huh?
Kenny?
Kenny
Kenny
Kenny!
The Spiritual Pressure has finally died down.
Still, it sure was something fierce.
Whats wrong with you?
Your body is trembling. How pathetic!
W-What?! Youre the one whos trembling!
What?! What part of me?
Whats this? Bird droppings?
H-Hey, whats the matter?!
Huh?!
There you are, damn you
I wont let you get away!
Ganju, you overdid it. That was mean.
Shut up! What about you?! What was that medicine?
This?
Its a kind of anesthetic called Shinten.”
One drop on the skin of someone with low Spiritual Pressure
will cause him to get dizzy and pass out.
Y-Youve got some scary stuff there, kid.
You think so?
But anyway, lets hurry.
Oh?
So the entrance is the shutter type.
Now the question is, how do we open it?
No problem.
Huh? What do you have this time?
I borrowed a spare key
from the underground water channel storage room last night.
H-Hey Is it okay for you to do that?
Its probably not okay, but
But I thought about it last night.
Ichigo is getting all battered up fighting
while all I do is keep running away.
It looks pretty bad, I thought.
I want to save Rukia, too.
So I decided Id do all I could toward that end.
Even if it means I will be punished later.
Of course, stealing a key is about all I can do.
Thats why Im no good.
No. Id say its enough.
Huh?
What youve done
Man, I tell you.
Everybodys desperate to save this person.
This Rukia must be quite a cutie
Well, uh, its not that
You dont have to get embarrassed.
Lets see what she really looks like. Hey, Rukia!
Huh?!
Who are you? Ichigoscomrade?
Its me, Rukia!
Im so glad! Youre all right, arent you?
YoureHanataro!
Why are you here?
We can talk later.
Ganju, lets hurry and get away from here.
Huh? Whats wrong, Ganju?
The pattern on his clothes
the unraveling eddy from heaven
Are you
a member of the Shiba clan?
Huh? Oh, do you know each other?
Yeah.
I know her.
As if I could forget
that face
She's
the Soul Reaper who killed my brother!
W-What are you saying, Ganju? Rukia wouldnt
My brothers wounds were from a sword.
His neck was slashed,
and hed been stabbed in the chest.
If hed fought with a Hollow, why did he die of sword wounds?!
And at that time, she told me
that she had killed him!
Ganju!
That-that cant be true!
Its all right, Hanataro.
He is correct.
R-Rukia?
A member of the Shiba clan
No doubt, it was your elder brother.
Shiba Kaienwas killed by me.
Do as you wish.
If I die by your hand, I will have no complaints.
What?!
Please stop, Ganju!
We didnt come here for that, did we?!
Didnt we come here to save her?!
Please, Ganju!
Didnt Ichigo entrust us with his determination?!
Shut up, will you?!
W-Whats with this Spiritual Pressure?
What?! Aizens been killed?!
When? By whom? Why?
This morning, before dawn.
This morning, before dawn.
The murderer and motives are, as yet
The murderer and motives are, as yet
unknown!
unknown!
Why didnt you awaken me earlier?
Sir! I was concerned about your health, so I delayed the report.
Please punish me.
Thats not fair, Kotsubaki!
Captain, please punish me, too.
Dont copy what I say, Kiyone!
Im not copying you!
Thats enough.
In any case I cant stay here like this.
ThatsSquad Six Captain,
Byakuya Kuchiki!
Byakuya Kuchiki H-Hes
You know him?
Of course.
The Kuchiki clan is one of the four noble houses
with the highest rank.
That guys the current clan leader.
Of the thirteen captains today, hes probably the most famous.
This is the worst thing that could happen
Someone like him appearing at a time like this.
Its no good. Theres no way we could win.
Maybe we should just beg for our lives.
W-What are you saying, Ganju?! Lets run away with Rukia!
You idiot! Do you see any way out?!
This bridge is the only way!
Are you telling me to risk my life for her?!
She killed my brother, you know!
For someone
For someone like her?!
I understand.
I guess it cant be helped.
There was never any reason for you to save Rukia, to begin with.
It would be asking too much to force you to stay here.
So, at least when you escape from here,
please take Rukia with you.
Ill make a stand here, and hold him off.
W-What are you talking about?
I think I understand how you feel.
No one would give his life to save his enemy.
Thats got nothing to do with it!
You felt the Spiritual Pressure, didnt you?!
No way can we handle this.
I know that, too.
Still, I came this far because I wanted to save Rukia.
I cant just leave without doing anything!
Thank you for everything youve done!
Ill be on my way.
Dont do it, Hanataro! You cant
What are you doing? Let me through!
That fool!
What does he think he can do without even a Zanpaku-to?
Hes trembling
Youre just a weakling. Dont go acting so tough!
Dammit!
Hey!
Stay back!
Ganju
Notagain!
Sorry, Brother. Avenging you will have to wait.
If youre gonna blame anyone,
blame Sis for not raising me to be a coward who would run out on his friends!
Here I come, young un!
I am your opponent!
Happy people
Come on, come on, come on
Happy people
Here we go!
Everybody stand up! Everybody fight!
Within your heart, you may feel uneasy
But keep your head right up!
To the sky!
No matter when (Oh yeah!)
No matter where (Oh yeah!)
Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!)
Ill be here for you
Happy people in the house!!!
With a tough smile
Happy people in the house!!!
Lets live!
Wow
Happy people in the house
All right
Happy people
The story is finally reaching a climax.
Maybe it's time for me to reveal my secret.
Can you guess what my secret is?
You can speak human, but not cat!
You dye your fur black!
You're actually a dog!
Bingo! Listen, you trying to make a fool of me?!
