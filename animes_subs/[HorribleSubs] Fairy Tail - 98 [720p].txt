The port town of Hargeon...
A Fairy Tail ship has just set sail from here.
With 8 teams of wizards aboard, it heads for Tenroujima.
The S Class Wizard Advancement Exam is a big annual event in Fairy Tail.
8 participants, including Natsu, and their chosen partners,
took up the challenge, set this year on the holy ground of Tenroujima.
Only one person can pass.
Who will be the one to open the door to S Class?
So hot...
Even though it was winter at home... What is this?!
I think I'm gonna melt!
I'll turn into ice cream and get eaten by Happy!
Not very appetizing...
Lu-chan, sit up straight.
Because of currents, this area has the same climate all year'round.
I feel sluggish...
I'm gonna turn into ice cream...
Aye...
This heat ain't nothin'.
Juvia, aren't you hot all bundled up in that?
Juvia is not hot...
But you could say...
Hot...
I feel sick!
Natsu! Keep it away from here, okay?
Wendy didn't perform a Troia spell on me!
You can't blame her.
After all, she's Mest's partner.
I'm sorry, Natsu-san.
I don't care for this chumminess when soon, we're all going to be enemies.
It's hot to be a Man!
I have no idea what that means.
I wanna eat ice cream...
Don't eat me, okay?
I can't even imagine you as ice cream, Happy...
It's in sight.
That...?
Who's the One with the Good Luck?
Have we arrived?
That's Tenroujima?!
What a freaky shape!
Is that an island on top of the island?
Wow... Even from here, I feel magic power in the air around the island.
Very impressive.
Natsu! We're almost there.
It's said that long ago,
there were fairies on that island.
Master...
Also, in reference to the very first Fairy Tail master,
there's Moebius Vermilion's Sleeping Ground!
What's with those clothes?!
After all, it's hot!
Someone who wears no clothes can talk?!
Now, I will announce your first trial.
First trial?!
Usually, the test is split up into different levels.
You see the smoke rising over the shore?
First, head over there.
You'll find 8 passages, but only one team can enter each passage.
And at the end of each passage, this will happen.
Battle
Calm
Pitched Battle
Entrance
First Trial Pass
Only the teams that get through this will pass the first trial.
Battle?
It says Pitched Battle on Erza and Gildarts' faces...
What is that?
There's Calm, too.
In the Battle route, two teams amongst the eight go head to head,
and only the team that wins can go on.
Pitched Battle is the most difficult route,
as you must defeat a current S Class wizard to proceed.
Calm is a route that can be used to get to the end without fighting.
In this first trial, you're being tested on armed might and luck!
Luck?!
If it's about luck, we have a chance!
There's only a 1 in 8 chance of getting the Silence route.
Theoretically, 6 teams at most can pass this stage.
I-Impossible!
I can't get past the path guarded by Gildarts or Erza!
Don't be such a coward!
In a worst-case scenario, only 3 teams would pass this...
Interesting! I'll put the boot to all of'em!
Uh, look...
So, get going!
The test has begun!
Huh?
We're still at sea.
You know what to do, Happy.
We'll choose our passage first!
Aye, sir!
No fair!
Natsu! You bastard!
A rune?!
Relax! It'll disappear in 5 minutes!
Fried!
Bastard!
We probably should've sealed them off'til the whole thing's over!
What kind of test would that be then?
Hey, Gramps! Is that kind of thing allowed?!
Well, it's not a race...
If we let them get to the island ahead of us,
they'll probably set up runes all over the place!
Dammit!
I know! Levy can get through!
Right, I can rewrite the spell!
But...
Only for Gajeel and me!
What?!
Levy-chan!
Sorry, Lu-chan!
See you guys later!
Jerks!
I've known Fried for a long time, too.
Evergreen!
Perhaps a more complicated trap would've been a problem,
but I can rewrite a rune like this.
Let's go, Elfman!
Man!
Dammit!
How many more minutes'til it turns off?
There are still 4 minutes left.
Then Levy escaped the rune in just one minute?
5 minutes later...
It's dispelled!
Let's go, Lucy!
Yeah!
Come on, Loke!
At least wear underpants!
Happy!
Aye, sir!
Ice Make...
Floor!
He turned the surface of the water to ice!
Lisanna-san, would you follow me?
Of course!
The sea and a fish?!
Hey, Cana! We're last!
No, Mest and Wendy are still up here.
Where?!
They disappeared?!
When?!
If we don't hurry, we won't be able to choose our passage!
This island... I'm feeling great magical power coming from the ground.
Yeah...
Let's go!
H route is blocked. F route is blocked. B route is blocked. A route is blocked.
Hey!
4 routes are sealed up?!
Which one should we pick, Natsu?
Mmm...
That's gotta be E for Erza!
Why would you choose Erza?
'Cause I wanna take her down, of course!
Wait for me, Erza!
He's made up his mind that Erza's down this way...
E route is blocked.
There are 7 X's. Then we are last...
It's okay! Like they say, saving the best for last.
If I have one good point, it's that I'm lucky.
We'll make you into an S Class wizard for sure, Cana!
Yeah. Thank you, Lucy.
It's lighter in here than I thought it'd be.
Because of the Spirit Light bugs, which are summer bugs with glowing bodies.
That voice!
Who's there?!
Don't tell me this is...
Battle
Battle?!
I was right! Cana and that cosplayer...
It's Lucy!
So we're supposed to fight you, eh?
Fried and Bickslow are members of the Thunder God Tribe.
Some time ago, in the Battle of Fairy Tail,
Lucy and Cana had a showdown with these two.
However...
Saving what for last, Lucy?
The Thunder God Tribe...
The person who couldn't even touch Fried...
The one who was beaten by Bickslow when Loke wasn't around to fight for her...
Tenroujima...
During the first trial to be promoted to an S Class wizard,
Lucy and Cana, the last of the 8 pairs to arrive, took the last passage left.
It turned out to be a Battle route, where two pairs must fight each other.
And what's being tested in this first stage...
is military might...
and luck.
It seems only the pair that wins can proceed through there!
It seems! It seems!
I'm sorry, but this is as far as you go, Cana.
I'm going to be the one to take Laxus's place.
Fine!
I've got my own reason for becoming an S Class wizard!
So it's on!
But before that, why don't you put on some clothes?
This way is better, Fried!
Better! Better!
No, it's not! It's distracting!
In that case...
Sexy Lady Cards!
Ladies coming out of the cards?!
You have no sense of decency!
Keep it together, Fried!
What's going on?!
I figured as much! He has a weakness for women!
Fine! I'll just have to deal with you myself!
Lucy!
Right!
Open! Gate of the Maiden!
Virgo!
Totally fan service version!
A-Another one!
That doesn't work on me!
Here I go, baby!
Virgo's duties...
Make grime and mold Vanish from the bathroom!
IR
Serve Lucy-sama faithfully, even if she acts IRresponsibly!
GO
GO outside and separate the trash!
You're so weak!
Why'd you call her?!
I thought another woman might be effective...
I don't wanna put the hurt on you too much, so hurry up and take a nap!
Dammit!
You're not gonna hit my guys!
Here we go, baby!
I'm counting on you, Aries!
I-I'm sorry...
Do something!
Yes, I'll try.
Wool Bomb!
What is this fluffiness?!
I-I'm sorry...
Another one...
Wool Wall!
So fluffy...
Just looking at it makes my thoughts fuzzy!
Hey, idiot!
You're not focusing on the problem at hand!
Problem at hand! Problem at hand!
Lucy...
We did it! Just like I planned!
They remember what happened last time, so they underestimated our strength!
Did I do okay? I'm sorry...
Uh... Lucy Kick...?
Knock it off!
Crap! The effect wore off!
You caught me off guard and fogged up my mind...
He's mad!
Dark Ecriture! Wings!
Cana!
No way am I gonna lose here!
Prayer's Fountain!
There's no use!
Again?!
Water!
Lucy, no! This water is meant for attacking!
It's dangerous to touch it!
I'll be fine!
Open! Gate of the Water Bearer!
Aquarius!
Another swimsuit?!
Aquarius, get'em!
Ouch! What was that for?!
They're the enemies!
What's with the outfit?
Hmph, you'll need 100 more years of experience
if you mean to draw a man's attention with a swimsuit.
Hey, bitch! What the hell are you doing?!
Excuse me?
Um, Cana...
Don't you know the difference between allies and enemies?!
All little girls are my enemy! Got it?!
What, do you think soft, supple skin equates to justice?!
The way you are, you'll never be able to get a boyfriend.
0 points. As a woman, you score a zero.
You're acting all cocky just because a couple of men are here?
That's a cheap woman who'll stoop to anything!
0 points!
Cheap woman!
These two are somehow similar...
I've got a date with my boyfriend, so I'm going home. With my boyfriend...
You don't have to say it twice!
How selfish!
We're not done here...
Oh, that's right.
What should we do, Cana?
All right, I'll use this one more time!
The same method won't work twice! We're up against Fried!
Stop it!
It's working again?!
C-Cut it out! I can't fight like this...
And on top of that...
Fried-sama!
Leave me alone!
You're so mean!
You're so mean!
That's sort of unsettling...
All right!
Go!
Okay!
Look at me, Fried-sama!
Look at me, too! See?!
W-W-W-Wha...?!
Fried-sama, you're so cute!
What?!
A wall of ladies?!
Hmph! What do you think?
That's amazing, Cana!
Oh, this is a piece of cheesecake!
What?!
It's nice and all that we've confined him, but now what do we do?
We can't actually win like this, can we?
There has to be a way to break through... Break through...
I'll escape that way!
Gotcha!
All right!
Crap!
Summoned Lightning!
I-I beat him...
Look! That passage is open now!
Then that means...
We did it!
We made it through the first trial!
Let's go, Lucy!
Are you really sure about this, Fried?
Yeah.
If it were anybody else, I'd have gone all out.
But I owed those two.
I'd decided that if we met here on the Battle route, I'd throw the fight.
Although the idea that you'd have a weakness for women was a bit over the top.
Right?
Shoot. And I was excited about taking Laxus's spot.
That's not the important thing.
It's all about Fairy Tail.
Besides, Laxus will come back some day, count on it.
Anyway, Lucy and Cana... Didn't figure we'd actually run into those two.
Lucky them, huh?
Meanwhile, in E route...
Erza! Hurry up and get out here!
Fight me!
It's not for sure that Erza is on this route...
Nuh-uh!! I took E for Erza's path!
Just up ahead, I'll defeat Erza and become an S Class wizard!
Natsu! The path is widening!
Somebody's there!
Who could it be?
Gildarts!
Hello there, Natsu.
You drew the short straw, huh?
It's over...
You know, I just hate holding back...
Natsu?!
I'm all fired up!
Natsu, nice try!
Nice try? What do you mean?
Well, the first trial of the test is over.
What are you talking about?! It just started!
Your opponent is Gildarts!
I don't have to stick around to know the outcome.
You just remember those words!
When I beat Gildarts, you'll be laughing outta the other side of your face!
Next time! Natsu versus Gildarts!
I think I might get the last laugh.
Well, go ahead and laugh, but you're gonna fight too, Happy.
After all, you're my partner.
