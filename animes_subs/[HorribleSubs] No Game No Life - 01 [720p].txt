I'm dead.
I'm dead. I died.
I'm dead. I died. I'm dead,
I'm dead. I died. I'm dead, Dead!
I'm dead. I died. I'm dead, Dead! Huh? How? I died?
They're level 40. This is impossible!
They're level 40. This is impossible! They're invincible!
What are they, monsters?
What are they, monsters? So strong for such a low level,
So strong for such a low level, How many just died?
So strong for such a low level, How many just died? A low-level spell took out 40 or 50 of us!
How many just died? A low-level spell took out 40 or 50 of us! Are these the legendary...?!
Are these the legendary...?! Is this gonna end with all of us dying?
Is this gonna end with all of us dying? No, there's still hope.
Is this gonna end with all of us dying? No, there's still hope. There's one person left.
There's one person left....Who?
The strongest: Queen.
I can't believe it!
There are only four of them!
And
they beat 1,200 players?
But... this is the end!
You're mine.
No way!
They dodged that, too?
Of the many urban legends out there,
4 Players vs 1,200 Players Deaths Deaths
have you ever heard this one?
A group of unknown players,
who win every single game they play
with scores no one has ever come close to.
Their account names are always left empty,
so they're only known as Blank.
These gamers are said to be unbeatable.
You think the Blanks are cheaters?
Yeah.
I'm sure of it.
They're a group of cheaters.
Otherwise, there's no way they could beat 1,200 people with four.
Auto-aimers and auto-dodgers. Hitbox manipulation.
They have to be cheating.
No.
We were the ones using dishonest means.
Otherwise, I'd never be able to launch huge spells like that one after another.
What?
But Blank dodged it.
That means they knew I was cheating to cast consecutive spells.
Blank...
I'm sure they're really smart!
What are they like, I wonder?
QUEEN: Blank... I'm sure they're really smart! What are they like, I wonder? <3<3
And so the rumors spread even faster.
Urban legends are a type of wish.
Because...
In reality, the least interesting answer is usually the correct one.
Brother: Sora, Age 18, Virgin Communication Disorder, NEET, Game-Obsessed
We won, somehow...
Listen, little sister, would you stop controlling the main account
Little Sister: Shiro, Age 11, Never Goes to School, Communication Disorder, Shut-In, Game-Obsessed
for Blank with your feet?
I'm hungry.
Want some?
Thanks.
Never thought I'd see you buy fancy rations like these.
Nutrition is important.
Sister, the human brain can function as long as it has glucose.
Beginner
White bread is best, in terms of cost-performance.
Thanks for the efficiency lecture.
But I need other types of nutrients, too, or I won't get bigger.
You're already a perfect, flawless beauty.
Don't worry about it.
Anyway, what time is it?
Um... 8:00 AM. The middle of the night.
What day?
Does that matter to a NEET?
It does!
It tells you when MMORPGs are going to have new events and ladder tournaments!
Wait!
I know you've been up for five days straight,
Proof she's been up for 5 days
but if you quit now, I won't have a healer!
You can do it.
Are you telling me to control four characters with two hands and two feet?
Fight!
Wait, no! Wait!
If you go to sleep, Shiro, everyone
and by everyone I mean me will die!
Fine, I'll do it!
The world is chaotic, unreasonable, and unfair.
It has no meaning at all.
It is the wish of those who realize this, who refuse to accept it.
A wish that the world would be at least a little interesting...
That's what
an urban legend is.
Then, let me try to help you out.
Have you ever heard a rumor like this?
Brother... email...
Your brother's been playing four characters on four separate screens.
I don't know what you want, but I don't have the energy.
It may be from a friend.
Whose friend?
Yours?
That's funny.
I think my beloved sister just said something really mean and sarcastic to me!
To Sender: unknown Have you two siblings ever felt like you were born in the wrong world?
What is this?
And how does he know that Blank are siblings?
What do we do?
Is he trying to bargain with us?
Well,
it might be fun to see where this goes.
Chess?
Good... night...
Wait, wait.
I can't handle a high-level chess program on my own!
Chess is a finite two-player, zero-sum, perfect-information game.
Luck has no part in it.
Theoretically, there is a perfect solution that will never lose.
But... only if you understand
the 10120 possible states of the board!
Chess is no different
from tic-tac-toe.
That's right.
Shiro has beaten a
program designed to defeat grandmasters 20 times in a row,
alternating between going first and second.
But...
It cut off its own piece's advance?
Wait, Shiro.
Brother...
A program will always select the best move.
That's why you can beat them.
But they're deliberately using a bad move to lure you in.
It's a human.
Calm down.
If it's a contest of skill, you'll never lose.
I'll tell you when they're trying to spook you or lure you in.
The two of us, Sora and Shiro, form Blank together.
Let's see if there's somebody
who can beat us.
Checkmate!
You are winner!
We won!
I haven't fought this hard in a long time.
Were they really human?
Sender: unknown Well done. If you're that good at games...
The world must be a tough place for you to live, right?
What?
What do you think about your world?
Is it fun?
Is it easy to live in?
What do we think?
There's no way to know the rules or the goal,
yet there are 7 billion players making whatever moves they want.
If you lose too much, or win too much, there are penalties.
You can't pass your turn,
and if you talk too much, you'll be ostracized.
There are no parameters and no way to even know the genre.
This world is just...
a crappy game.
Sender: unknown If there was a world where simple games decided everything...
a world on a board, where the rules and goal were clear, what would you think about that?
If there's a world like that,
then we were born in the wrong world.
What's going on?
Brother...
I think so, too!
You were definitely born in the wrong world!
So I'll let you be reborn!
In the world you should've been born in!
What is this?
This is the ideal world you've always dreamed of.
The world on a game board: Disboard!
Everything in this world is decided by simple games.
People's lives... even national borders!
Who are you?
Me?
I'm Tet.
I live over there.
A god?
A god?
Now's not the time!
What do we do about this?!
In this world, everything is decided by ten pledges.
One: All murder, war, and robbery is forbidden in this world.
Two: All conflict in this world will be resolved through games.
Three: In games, each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value.
Four: As long as it doesn't go against number three,
what they bet and the rules of the game will not be questioned.
Five: The challenged party has the right to decide the rules of the game.
Six: Any bets made in accordance with the pledges must be upheld.
Seven: Conflicts between groups will be conducted
by designated representatives with absolute authority.
Eight: Being caught cheating during a game is grounds for an instant loss.
Nine: In the name of God, the previous rules may never be changed.
I said, this is not the time!
The ground! The ground's getting close!
Brother!
Shiro!
And ten: Let's all have fun and play together!
Hey!
I look forward to seeing you again.
I don't think it'll be long...
Brother...
Where are we?
Sister...
I've always thought that life was an impossible game.
A game for masochists. But...
It's finally bugged out!
What's going on?
This game is total crap!
Long ago, in the distant, distant past,
the gods, along with their families and creations,
waged an eternal war for the right to rule the world,
the right to be the One True God.
The long, brutal battle came to a swift end without a victor
with the death of the sky, the sea, the land, and the stars.
The single deity who had not participated in the battle
won by default
and assumed the title of One True God.
His name was Tet.
He was once known as the god of play.
You creatures who have fought with strength, violence, blood, and death,
who built a tower of corpses that rises to the sky and call yourselves wise,
What is the difference between you and the dumb beasts?
In the face of their shattered world, excuses were meaningless.
And then, God spoke.
All murder and robbery in this realm is forbidden, he said.
use your wisdom and wit, your fortune and wealth,
to build a tower of wisdom.
And prove to me...
I see.
So that's why there's a world where
everything is decided by games, according to ten pledges.
Yes. And by the way...
What?
Do you suppose you could leave us with a pair of pants?
Six: Any bets made in accordance with the pledges must be upheld.
We bet everything we could offer, including our lives,
and you bet everything you owned.
Right?
That's right, but...
You can't leave us here like this!
Let's go, Shiro.
Roger.
Wait! Kid!
At least let me punch you once!
Looks like even thieves can't rob or kill you.
Even if they want to, they probably can't.
In other words...
It all comes down to your skill at the game.
Kingdom of Elkia - Capital City Elkia
Would you hurry up?
Shut up!
I'm thinking!
You can think all you want, but it won't change your hand.
A gambling tournament to determine the next king?
It was the last king's dying wish.
He wants the next king to be humanity's best gambler.
So even the king is decided by a game.
The red-haired girl is Stephanie Dola.
She's the granddaughter of the last king,
but, because of his will, she can't inherit the throne.
So she's entered the gambling tournament.
Shiro, are you okay?
I'm fine.
What? Falling in love with me?
No, I was just wondering if you were going to enter.
Me? This is all I need.
And...
that Kurami girl is so strong that most of the other players withdrew.
In other words, you're scared?
What?
Well, as long as you don't actually lose here,
you can make up any number of excuses later.
I actually won, but I let her go, for example.
Interesting.
Want to play, boy?
Sorry, but I don't play for fun.
Bet all that money.
What?! Do you know much is in here?
We have to bet something we both agree is equal, or it isn't a game.
Pledge three, was it?
Fair enough...
How about you can do whatever you want with the two of us?
Sell us, abandon us, whatever you want.
Are you serious?
We're serious.
We'll play a single hand of poker.
What do you say?
This is your last chance to quit.
Don't get cocky, outsider.
I'll do it.
I swear by the pledges.
I swear by the pledges.
Aschente (I swear by the pledges)
Aschente!
Just a stupid kid from the backwoods with more confidence than anything.
That bluff might work in your little village,
but it won't work here.
Brother...
Bad luck, huh?
Poor thing.
Yeah. I started the day with a 10,000 meter skydive,
then walked forever under the blazing sun.
Definitely a bad day.
What are you talking about?
Nothing.
You ready?
I'm ready.
I'll let you exchange cards once more, if you want.
No, thanks.
Oh?
Then...
Sorry, boy!
Full house!
Oh, yeah.
Sorry is right.
Ro...
Royal...
S-Straight...
F-F-Flush?!
No way! No way! No way!
Look close. It's real.
Impossible! There's only a 1 in 6,150,000 chance...
And that's what just happened.
But...
Pledge six.
Any bets must be upheld.
Right?
Just who are you?
Nobody special. Just...
an outsider.
That was cheating, Brother.
Really obvious cheating, too.
Pledge eight: Being caught cheating during a game is grounds for an instant loss.
In other words, if you're not caught, it's fine.
How much is in there?
No idea.
Just leave it to me.
Negotiations are my specialty.
I'll take a room for two.
One bed is fine.
How many nights can I stay with this?
One night.
I'm really tired.
Why don't you tell me how many nights I can really stay?
If you're trying to cheat someone,
you should pay more attention to your tone and where you're looking.
Two nights.
And there you go again.
Think very carefully about who you lie to, okay?
Okay, four nights. Thanks.
What's your name?
Just leave it blank.
For games only
Sorry for the wait, Shiro.
She's going to lose.
Sure she will.
She doesn't know the term poker face, unlike her oppone
She's cheating?
No doubt about it.
But...
I can't tell how.
I see...
I can't believe it, but this world...
Seriously?
What will you do? Fold?
Sh-Shut up!
Let's fight, fair and square!
Um... um...
Okay!
She's cheating.
Then, you're ready, right?
O-Of course!
Smartphones. DSPs.
Tablet.
Battery and solar charger.
Cables...
Is this all we have?
Well, after what happened, maybe we're lucky we've still got this much.
I can't get a signal.
I'm sure.
This is a true fantasy world.
The way she was cheating... Seriously, there's gotta be a limit.
Brother,
can you beat that?
It was a stupid question.
Hey, Shiro.
Usually, in a story, when the protagonists end up in another world,
they try their best to find a way home, right?
Why would they try to go back to a world like that?
I think so, too...
Then it's decided.
Find a place to stay
Now, let the game begin.
Shiro, I'm glad, as your brother,
that you love me so much, but let me go for a second.
Who's there? I paid up front
Can I come in?
Challenger
To save someone...
Do you need a reason, beyond the fact that it's fun?
