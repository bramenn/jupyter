Huntsman of Belparaso, I open thee!
Samagui!
Go shoot down Layla's daughter!
Samagui of Belparaso!
Even I know him...
He's used as the basis for children's books up north.
A living legendary huntsman?
Human Gate.
Wind: Check.
Angle: Check.
Would a huntsman shoot a human?
Even from that posture?!
Beast, human, it matters not.
Be it my master's order, I will hunt it.
You won't get past me!
What?
Firing high in the air?
That angle's nuts!
This is the reason I made him meh subordinate.
His shooting ability is far beyond that of some wizard shooting a magic gun.
Not if I can help it!
What?
He did that to my arrows with rubble?!
I see.
Your skills are indeed impressive.
But not up to the level of Sagittarius.
Damn it!
Hurry up after that woman!
A huntsman never lets his prey escape!
Honestly... That woman? Prey?
That's beyond insulting...
I'm coming through!
No, you are not.
Move from there!
According to what Crux said, you were contracted with Layla 20 years ago.
And although I'm not sure what deal happened in the human world,
your master now is Layla's daughter, Lucy.
It doesn't seem like Lucy knows this herself, however.
Tell me what exactly happened, Capricorn.
Taboo.
Each and every magic has some rule which cannot be violated.
As for meh, I tried to break it.
What?
And the result is this form.
A goat! Go ahead and laugh!
Around that time, Natsu and Happy, having sensed the enemy's presence,
or rather, smelled their scent, were heading deeper into Tenroujima.
His smell is this way!
Wait, Natsu!
The path isn't very good, so you should watch your step!
See, Natsu?
Stop! Stop...
Huh? He got quiet all of a sudden.
He gets nauseous sliding on leaves? Sheesh.
That didn't hurt... at all!
It's him...
Natsu!
Natsu!
The ground!
What?
There was a small sapling there.
My Time Ark has guided the sapling to its future.
I wonder where your future leads, Natsu Dragneel?
You're the one from back then...
It's definitely the same smell.
The guy who used Lyon and the others in Galuna Island?
Is dressin' in women's clothing your hobby or something?
Oh... That would explain.
Um, this is what I really look like.
I'm one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory of Grimoire Heart.
Ultear Milkovich.
Ul-Tea Milk?
Don't trip over your tongue.
Don't tell me you're after Zeref, too?
That guy is... Zeref?
This guy made Lullaby and Deliora...
Him?
No way!
Zeref is a person from a long, long time ago!
You can't have him, got it?
Zeref is mine.
Who'd want'im?!
I ain't gonna forgive you guys when you don't even care about your friends!
Oh?
Then I suppose I'd better pay you back for that last time...
And this time, for real!
On the other hand, Erza and Juvia had gone to gather their comrades
immediately after hearing of the attack, and before them appeared...
Juvia Lockser.
A former member of Phantom Lord's Elemental Four.
Plus Titania, Erza Scarlet.
Then you have already researched about Juvia and Erza?
State your name, villain!
I do not deem answering that as necessary.
Starting battle.
Here we go, Juvia!
Right!
But Juvia is worried about Gray-sama...
She wants to be by his side soon!
Ah! What if Gray-sama is in big trouble right now...
Why... is it so hard to breathe?
My heart, it aches.
Something has taken a hold of my heart!
Gray!
It seems I was too weak to be your partner after all!
Sorry to be such a spoiler!
I've brought your best partner with me!
But... Juvia...
You came for me, Juvia...
The shortness of breath, the thing that's grabbed my heart...
Gray-sama...
The two of us are S Class partners recognized throughout the guild...
No, throughout the world!
Juvia...
Gray-sama...
Juvia is so moved!
Will you try concentrating?!
Right!
Maguilty Sodom!
She's coming for us!
Erza-san, this is...
Magic blades?
She can summon weapons as well?
Go.
Juvia's body is made of water!
No matter the attack, Juvia will not...
Juvia!
Juvia's body made of water... was injured?
My blades attack the sense of pain directly.
In other words, they are sensory blades.
That magic power...
I see.
You must be one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory.
I do not deem answering that as necessary.
Wipe out the enemy. That is my mission.
I've started to get a bit nostalgic for the body of a human.
This is perfect timing.
What have you been talking about?
Human Subordination Magic, Humaraise!
That magic won't work on me.
Because I am a Spirit, not a human.
Yes... And that is why this is taboo.
This magic cannot be used on those who are not human.
What's this?
I'm suddenly in a trap?
Someone who breaks this rule...
It can't be...
You...
They are fused together...
So you're actually Capricorn that's been fused with a human?
This time I'll take your body, Leo!
Why, you...
Just a little too late.
What's wrong?
We don't have time to stand around!
Right... I'm sorry.
But I think maybe it'd be better to go back.
I know how you feel, but we can't.
Loke had a reason for what he did.
That magic of his...
We'd get in his way if we were around.
Come on, you shouldn't be worried.
He's the leader of the 12 Zodiac Gates, remember?
Go ahead and believe in him.
You're right.
Okay! Let's get together with the others and go search for the enemy!
Yeah!
Let's hurry...
Loke... You'd better come back safe to me!
You'd better!
Oww...
I see. Meh attack from before...
I mean, my attack.
But I've finally gotten my hands on a human form!
You've been good to me until now, goat body.
Can't move after taking Leo's attack?
Meh name... I mean, my name is Leo.
My master is Lucy.
Lucy Heartfilia.
If I can kill that master, then I can become a perfect human.
Oh, yes. Lucy trusts this body.
Perhaps I shall catch her off guard?
Or maybe I'll subjugate her and play around for a little while?
She's beautiful, like Layla-sama!
What the...
Why, you...
Regulus is full.
Isn't that right, Zoldio-sama?
Don't you dare...
Don't you dare say that name!
Capricorn.
I do apologize for having to be a bit rough.
No, it's okay.
You had to be, or separating him would have been impossible.
W-Why?
Why can you move, Capricorn?
Immediately when you fused with Leo-sama,
he gave me the light of the king, Regulus.
That... was giving you magic power?!
How dare you...
How dare you!
But... I'm finally back to my original body!
My body...
What... What is this?
What's happening?
Stop it! Stop it!
Capricorn, save me!
I don't want to disappear!
Save me... Layla-sama!
Such is the fate of those who break the taboos.
It was 20 years ago.
Layla-sama retired from Wizardry to preserve her health.
She bequeathed Cancer-sama, Aquarius-sama, and meh to three of her servants.
One of them was Zoldio-sama, and he received meh key.
But Layla and meh made one final contract.
I pledge to protect your family for now to eternity.
If in the future, your offspring chooses to walk the path of magic...
Yes.
If that time comes, please help them, Capricorn.
So that's how Lucy became your master.
Zoldio-sama consented to that contract at first,
but soon after he left the mansion,
and while wandering aimlessly, he ended up being touched by dark magic...
He violated the taboo, and fused with you.
Sometimes strong magic power will lead people to the dark side.
I've seen it myself.
Nothing is harder to take.
So, what do you think of Lucy-sama?
She is, indeed, Layla-sama's daughter.
I know well how beloved she is by her Spirits, and how much she loves them in return.
So you'll help, right?
You'll help Lucy?
No.
Lucy-sama cannot borrow meh help at this time.
For meh power has always been Lucy-sama's from the start.
I can finally return to meh master's side.
What's the matter?
Did something happen with Loke?
Yeah!
He says he won!
We can count on him!
He said he'll explain more later, but Capricorn is on our side now!
Also, he needs to regain his energy,
so he's returning to the Spirit World as my Spirit again.
What?!
I see...
Now that I think about it,
he was using his own magic power to stay in the Human World until now.
Hold it!
What about being my partner, huh?!
He said to tell you he's sorry, Gray!
Screw that!
I haven't given up on being S Class yet!
S Class...
Now, let's get a move on!
Sheesh...
Hold up a second, Lucy.
Why don't we split up to search for the 7 Kin of Purgatory?
But I don't wanna go alone!
Don't worry!
I'll protect you, Lucy!
Wait, Cana...
So you mean split into two groups, not split up.
What? Wanna mix it up with the girls?
That's not what I meant!
I think it'd be smarter to attack with everyone together.
I want to attack the enemy as soon as possible.
That way we can resume the S Class exam.
That's why we should split up and search.
Or are you scared to go alone, Gray?
Cana?
Fine, then.
We'll split up here.
Be careful, Gray!
You too.
Give me a break, you nut!
If you hadn't gotten in my way, I'd have been an S Class wizard by now!
Is that your future?
The other future of the fractured crystal ball...
Parallel worlds...
I can create an infinite number of futures,
and contract them to head toward a single future.
Flash Forward!
Now, now, the fun's just beginning!
Natsu!
This is the remains of the base camp.
Both of them are breathing.
They'll be okay.
But for Gajeel to get taken out in the process, and Mira to lose...
It was my fault.
Mine...
It's not anyone's fault.
Elf-niichan!
They're strong.
I hate to say it, but they're too damn strong!
There was nothing I could do.
Damn it!
I'm a failure of a Man!
I wasn't able to protect my sister or my partner!
We have to become one.
Levy...
The exam had us all split up.
It was just for a bit, but we were putting ourselves before our friends.
But, we can't do that now!
The enemy is extremely powerful!
But we are Fairy Tail!
If we all combine our power... If we can act as one...
Everyone, please...
Join together as one...
Please...
Mavis's grave?
Right.
You told me you'd figured out where it was, right?
A lot happened and it kind of took a backseat, but I'm curious...
Sure, okay.
But it's about halfway guessing.
First, I thought of a lot of different words associated with grave.
Death, sleep, earth, stone, star, end...
But none of them were 6 letters long.
Wait... What does being 6 letters have to do with anything?
The time limit.
He said we had to find it in 6 hours, right?
It's a bit ham-fisted,
but I found a word that's 6 letters for 6 hours and associated with a grave.
Demise.
It means to perish.
It's related to a grave and also 6 letters.
It includes the concept of time, too.
Then the rest is just intuition, but demise has a letter that doesn't fit with the others.
Do you see it?
When you mention it...
There's one letter that was used twice.
You see, the paths we chose were lettered, right?
You mean the ones from the first test?
Right!
Route E!
I bet it's in... there...
Thank you, Lucy.
I'm sorry.
I want some kind of special move.
Like a Roar, or Iron Fist, or Claws...
It's not fair, Natsu!
But it's not just me.
Oh, but wait a second!
Maybe there is a special move!
Oh? Like what?
Light Lucy on fire, and chuck her at the enemy!
Lucy Fire!
But then that's basically a special move for Lucy!
Oh, but if Lucy's the bullet that's basically mine, then...
Natsu, do you even understand the point?
