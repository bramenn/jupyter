Every weekday's tightly packed.
Madly dashing around again since morning.
Rat race? Looks like fun. But surprisingly death-defying.
What I'd like is a slow lifestyle.
My wish made on a shootin' star.
But there's no mercy, 1003.
Full of things you can't divide.
Full of things you can't divide. Genshiken
That's why I've carried this in my hands...
I jam-packed the rest with it...
A modest happiness. A shared joy!
We're about to etch them now right into our youth.
So lonely to just walk on by.
So sad to have this frustration!
Let's take a break from today...
A year sure does go by fast.
Huh?
I was thinking it's time for the activities fair already.
Yeah, now that you mention it. A whole year...
I wonder if any new members will join this year.
I couldn't tell you.
I mean, you saw how Kasukabe turned them all away last year.
Ahh... true.
It's like, I'd rather not give my name out to otaku.
Well, I do have a feeling she's a little more well-rounded now.
Really, you do?
Don't you think so?
Up and to the right a bit.
Okay.
So how about Kujiun: Second Term?
Heh.
I didn't think it would happen, so I guess the fact that it did is pretty good.
Maybe.
Just so long as they give us a certain level of...
Anime turns people into adults.
What kind of adults?
Doesn't this belong to Kugayama?
Uh, yeah. I'm pretty sure it does.
It'd be best to return it...
But he hasn't shown up here lately.
Isn't he busy with job hunting?
Looks like his parents have some high hopes.
Tanaka said he and Ohno were in Nippori.
Ahh, excess.
You know, those two sure are close.
And they're both cosplayers.
So, speaking of job hunting?
Oh, me?
Hmmm...
Wait, what the?
Wait, what the? Huh?
Hello.
H-hello.
You're... Kuchiki, right?
I heard you joined the anime club. What's up?
Well, you see, I have been training.
Huh? Training? In what?
Fighting games, etc.
Select your team member.
Hey, can you do this?
Well, it'll buy time until Kohsaka gets here.
Then we'll have him pound him.
Ouch.
You don't... seem to have gotten very good.
So what was this training?
It was a lie.
Wha?
Hey, it's Coochy. What brings him here?
Yes, yes!
Nobody in the anime club would call me Coochy!
I feel so moved!
I feel so moved! Oh really. Isn't that nice.
Oh really. Isn't that nice.
Nobody understands me!
Just tell me why he's here.
Well, we haven't found that out yet either.
Here's how it is, simple, concise, plain, easily understandable, and basic!
I desire an unlimited transfer to the Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture...
Wow, what a great retort!
It's everything I'd hoped for!
So, the point is you want to join us.
Yes indee...
Yes indee... No!
Done already? Aren't you pissed?
Come on, hit me. I'll throw you out.
I'm sorry. Please let me in Genshiken.
That's what you should've said first.
Fine.
Wha?
Yes!
Yahoo!
You sure?
Huh? About what?
Uh...
She really is more well-rounded?
Or maybe it just doesn't matter to her anymore?
Khorosho! Khorosho!
Khorosho! Khorosho! Shut up!
Come on!
Here we go!
Such nice weather.
S-so you like spring, huh?
Huh? Sure I like it... Why'd you ask?
Kasu/haru: Spring
kasu/haru: Spring Kasukabe: Haru-hi-be, a spring day.
Kasukabe: Haru-hi-be, a spring day.
You think that move'll work against me?
Wh-what?
What?
What's wrong?
Well... there's some commotion.
I can't see it, but it's the second floor, over there.
Let's see.
Oh, there?
That's the manga club...
Wha?
What the heck?
Whoa, she fell?
Huh, for real?
I mean, she jumped?
Wh-why?
Think she's okay? Should we call an ambulance?
Uh, well... I think her clubmates will take care of it.
Well...
I figure you've heard the rumor, but...
So this idea is both embarrassing yet shameless...
Hmmm.
I don't know.
Which of them was more at fault for this trouble?
I guess 90 the new girl.
And you want to force her on us?
Well, she did say she wanted to join your kind of circle.
Genshiken doesn't have many members, and you get along well.
We too have our share of situations.
We do?
And besides...
I don't think that'll be a problem.
Why not?
A woman's wrath is a scary thing.
Let me be candid.
Our girls already can't stand any of the girls in Genshiken, so I don't...
No way! Saki... I could understand, but...
Cut that out.
Why don't we at least have a look at her?
Looks like this isn't easy for Takayanagi, either.
You have no idea what a relief it is to hear that!
It's tough being caught between women, eh?
Damn straight!
Hmmm, well if Kasukabe says okay...
I'll go get her.
Huh? Now?
Bandage girl...
A sullen character?
Tailor-made, huh?
She's shorter than what I was expecting.
Okay, why not introduce yourself?
All right.
My name is Ogiue, and I hate otaku.
I especially hate female otaku.
W-well, this's how she is.
Why do they like gay men so much?
Look, I don't know what happened at the manga club, but...
Aren't you otaku too?
Aren't you?
Kasukabe! Calm down! Calm down!
Yes, I should! I'm more well-rounded now!
I've got a boyfriend, see?
I've got a boyfriend, see? Huh?
Just coming here doesn't make me an otaku!
Got it?
You're not one?
Hey, Ohno! You speak up, too!
Uh... o-okay.
No woman doesn't like gay men!
Am I included in that?
Naturally!
So Takayanagi, this is how she ended up...
Uh... yeah, more or less...
Why'd you jump, anyway? To admit defeat?
You insinuate.
You insinuate. That hit a nerve.
That hit a nerve.
Never mind tastes like gay men and whatnot.
That pain of yours is pretty otaku-ish.
Joining a circle must mean you want companions, right?
Work out that issue first.
Now, now! Upperclassmen, freshman girl...
Let's just forget the petty things. They're nothing.
Just bite your tongue. Nothing! Nothing!
This guy's messed up.
There it is again!
Oh.
He's stopped.
Or did her glare freeze him?
Wow, that's gutl...
Ah.
What the hell's your problem?
Discipline him!
You don't go hitting women!
There, there.
Discipline?
Discipline?
How would we do that?
Looks like it's already done...
Genshiken
I keep wondering if it looks too deliberate.
No! We can't expose her true nature unless we go this far!
Uh-oh! She's looking outside!
See, told you it's suspicious.
She'll never know where we are.
She'll never know where we are. Yes, well...
Yes, well...
Today Saki and Kohsaka are on a date, and Kugayama is job hunting.
With Kuchiki away on business in Akihabara, this is an excellent chance!
What do you think, Tanaka?
Uh, well...
This could be the advent of Dark Ohno.
Oh, she's straightening it up.
That's no surprise.
Hey, peoples.
Oh. Here alone, Ogiue?
Yes.
Wh-why's Saki there?
Huh? She is?
Yeah, it's true.
What happened to her date? Things were just getting good!
Kohsaka's making the rounds in Akihabara.
We're doing our own things.
Well, the meal was good. That'll have to do.
It must be hard, dating an otaku.
Well, it's not a matter of sharing the same tastes.
Hm? What're these?
Are they by any chance...
Yeah, that's what they are. These yours?
No!
They were already here when I arrived, all for show.
You don't say.
They're Ohno's, then.
I wonder why she brought so many.
Harassment, perhaps?
Ouch.
Want to find out for sure?
Huh?
What could they be talking about?
It's not like we can hear them.
Huh? Saki's dialing her cell...
Me? Me?
What should I do?
It's Saki, all right.
Hello.
Ah!
Hey, it's Kasukabe. Got a minute?
Uh, uh, uhh, I might. I'm not real sure.
Where are you? Near the club building?
Y-yes, well I wouldn't say I'm not near the building...
Meaning what? Where are you?
In... in the bathroom.
Oh, whoops. Sorry.
S'okay...
Just one question, then.
I'm in the clubroom.
Are all these homo dojinshi on the table yours?
Yes, they are...
Okay! Yeah, thanks, that was all.
Bye.
Uh-huh...
It will seem suspicious if I don't hurry and go.
That goes without saying.
Here's what gets me...
See, this one's based on a foreign movie.
A regular live-action one. I've seen it, too.
But does that mean whoever drew this...
It's strange. I know it never crosses my mind...
That's why such people have something wrong upstairs.
Oh, and also, when male otaku buy porn dojinshi...
Isn't it so they can use them?
Does that mean that female otaku...
I have no idea!
I mean, I look at it, and it doesn't put me in that kind of mood at all!
But if you hate it that much, you must have at least read some.
Otherwise you couldn't complain.
You trying to lead me?
I'm right, though, huh?
I first did in fifth grade... a friend's copy...
Damn, that's twisted!
So that ended up being traumatic?
Well... pretty much.
Yow, that's rough, all right.
What could they be talking about?
Who knows...
Can't we bug the room?
No, we cannot.
Then I have no choice. I'm going over there.
Oh, you are?
The surprise is ruined now. Watching them is meaningless.
Please wait a while, then come on over.
Ayup.
So, you still go for Ohno when she's like that?
Well, if I had to say yes or no...
Then yeah... I suppose so.
Good luck, then.
If you don't like gay stuff, what do you like?
Anime and such?
I guess... I also play games.
But aren't there not many girls who play?
Guys play games even if they're not otaku...
I wouldn't know.
Hello.
Hello, Ohno.
Took long enough. Bad constipation?
P-please don't talk like that just because it's all girls here!
Oh, that was nothing! I went to an all-girls' school.
S-so, I just found out that Ogiue hates...
Please don't ask. I don't want to discuss it.
Please don't tell. I don't want to know.
Things went downhill fast.
Guess we should get over there, too?
As naturally as possible, you mean?
Dear me, a yaoi book in fifth grade?
That's all it took to traumatize you?
I find that hard to believe.
In America, some girls were already @S S@ by that age.
Don't talk like that just because it's all girls here.
And don't look at me when you say it!
Wouldn't it be more natural to take the plunge and get into it at that point?
You're indecent, the way you try to push your values on to other people.
Oh, looks like a bull's-eye.
Now you're desperate to change the subject.
For all intents and purposes, you're still an otaku, right?
It would never have really been traumatic.
I told you, don't say it to me.
Isn't clinging to an obvious lie the far more indecent thing to do?
Hey, Saki. When it comes to people like her...
Which of us is indecent, huh?
I bet you all S S while you look at this junk!
Hey. Just because it's all girls here...
This is the kind of thing I @S S to!
Somebody...
Somebody, save me...
Hello!
Huh? Is the meeting over already?
Ohh, Ogichin! You're here, good timing!
Ogichin?
You went to Tosanbo last Sunday, didn't you?
Heh?
See, I happened to be there for a different event.
Hn?
Hn? Hmm?
Here's Ogichin entering the hall...
Look, I even shot some video.
What's that, some otaku event?
Not only that, a yaoi-only event!
You were spying?
You were spying? In effect, yes.
You ass!
The more convenience we have in this world, the lower people get!
You're a prime example!
Um, remain calm, Ogichin.
A-ah, you see... my little brother...
Oh, you have a younger brother!
H-he...
He...
Go on!
Huh?
He plays basketball!
Aha, does he now!
This is the third floor!
Come on, Ohno! Help me out!
Oh no, emergency!
Wh... what did we miss?
Who cares what you missed? Hold her down!
Wh-what did I miss?
We took no detours or shortcuts...
Only vivid dreams extended deep into the shadows.
We were simple when we were young...
The time we spied from there...
What is seen from the marbles...
Our guest this time is our newest member, Chika Ogiue.
Give her a hand!
Wh-what the heck?
While we're on the subject, your I hate otaku admission...
I expect we'll be hearing some more famous lines from you?
Famous lines?
Famous lines are an essential part of a character!
It's no exaggeration to say their first spoken line determines everything!
