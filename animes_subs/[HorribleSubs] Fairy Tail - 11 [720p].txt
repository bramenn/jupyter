The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Oh, yeah! Can you hear this voice?
Oh, yeah! It's hoarse from yelling.
Oh, yeah! Until your heart can hear it...
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
The moon and sun high-five.
Are you sure you're not forgetting something?
When you're not here to make me laugh,
even what I'm looking for can't be found.
Snowing, be honest with yourself and smile,
because when two people lay close, time overlaps.
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Don't say goodbye!
Previously on Fairy Tail!
Only wizards who have been given permission by the master can take on S class quests.
So I guess they'd be impossible for Natsu or me...
Hey, not in my room!
Master, one of the requests on the second floor has disappeared!
An S class quest?
Let's do it, Lucy!
Say what? A request is gone?
If it was put up on the second floor, then it's an S class, right?
Who would be stupid enough to take something like that?
A cat.
I saw a cat with wings tear one off.
Happy did?
Which means it's Natsu and Lucy!
What the heck are they thinking?
Going out on an S class quest without permission?
I always thought they were dumb, but not that dumb.
This is quite a serious violation of the rules.
If they make it back they're expelled... Right, old man?
But with their skills they won't be coming back from an S class, will they?
Laxus, if you knew, why didn't you stop them?
All I saw was a cat burglar run off with a scrap of paper.
I had no idea that was actually Happy.
And I never would have thought Natsu would go on an S class.
Been a while since I've seen you look at me that way.
This is not good.
Which request is missing?
The cursed island, Galuna.
What?
Galuna Island?
That's insane!
Those guys are such idiots!
Laxus! Go bring them back!
You're kidding me.
I've got work to do.
Aren't the wizards in this guild supposed to be able to take care of themselves?
Right?
Who other than you in here has the power to bring Natsu back by force?
Gramps...
I can't let that one ride.
The Cursed Island!
The port town of Hargeon.
Ooh, how nostalgic!
This was the town where we all met, you know?
Nostalgic? It wasn't exactly that long ago.
Lucy's like an old lady.
Okay, first thing is to find a ship to take us to Galuna Island.
A ship?!
No way! Not a chance!
We're swimming, got it?
That's even less a chance.
Galuna Island?
You've got to be kidding me.
I'm not going anywhere near it!
Give me break! I don't want to hear the name!
We don't mention that island around this port.
It's cursed, and it's a bad omen.
I don't know why you want to go there, but there isn't any ship here that'll take you.
Even pirates avoid it.
But...
Then it's decided. We're swimming!
Aye!
That's impossible, got it?
Found you.
Gray?
What are you doing here?
Orders from Gramps to bring you back.
The jig's up already?
If you go back now, you might even get away without being expelled.
We're going back.
Expelled?!
As if! I'm goin' on an S class quest!
You ain't got the skills to handle it!
If Erza finds out about this, you'll...
Gray, save me!
Those two forced me to come with them!
You traitor!
I'm gonna face Erza down!
I'm not gonna back down from this!
This is a direct order from the master!
I'm gonna bring you back by force if I have to!
Don't complain if you get hurt!
You're on!
Magic?
Are you wizards?
Could you be here to lift the curse from the island?
Yeah!
Well, we were...
I won't let you go!
Get on board!
Seriously?
Hey!
Oh well, guess we're ridin' this boat.
We're taking Gray with us?
If this guy goes back to the guild, Erza'll be coming next!
Furthermore...
Great, now I get scared...
You're one to talk, after getting me mixed up in this!
And you too!
Why'd you launch the boat?
My name is Bobo.
I once was a citizen of that island.
I ran away from that cursed isle.
If you go to that island, grave misfortune will befall you.
Can you really undo the curse?
The demon curse.
Mister, your arm...
The curse... You don't mean...
You can see it now.
That's Galuna Island.
What's that? There's something shining on the peak of the mountain.
Huh? Where'd he go?!
Did he fall overboard?
He disappeared when we weren't looking.
What's that sound?
Whoa!
It's a giant wave!
We're being engulfed! Hold on!
Happy, grab onto the boat and fly!
I can't!
Where am I?
Galuna Island.
We arrived!
A giant wave washed us here.
Good thing we lucked out.
But what was with that guy...
He said something about the Demon Curse?
Who cares! Let's go exploring!
It's an expedition!
Aye!
So you're more interested in that than the request?
There seems to be only one village on this island.
The chieftain there is the person who made the request.
Let's search for him first.
Wait.
What? The ship's destroyed, so you can't bring us back.
No. I'm coming.
It'd be annoying if you got up to the second floor before me, and if you got expelled that wouldn't be any fun.
We do this job right, and Gramps has nothing to complain about, right?
Let's go!
Yeah!
Keep Out.
Okay, we made it here. Now what?
What do they mean, keep out?
Excuse us! Please open the gate!
Should we bust it down?
No!
Who goes there?!
We're from the wizard's guild, Fairy Tail!
We didn't hear that anyone accepted the request!
Uh, well...
There must have been a mix up, and the message was late!
Show us your marks! All of you!
They're for real!
They actually came!
It's like we're entering the mouth of a giant monster.
Please don't say things like that.
I am the chief of this village, Moka!
Firstly, I have something to show you.
Villagers!
The same as the man on the boat.
Yeah.
Those sideburns are incredible!
No, no... This is what I wanted to show you.
Every living thing on this island has been cursed like this. Dogs and birds, without exception.
Not that I doubt you, but what basis do you have for calling it a curse?
Have you considered it might be an epidemic?
We've consulted countless doctors, but they say there is no disease like this.
And this appearance of ours is linked to moon's evil spell.
The moon's spell?
This place has absorbed moonlight since ancient times, and the island once sparkled beautifully like the moon.
But some years ago, the light from the moon started changing to a purple color.
A purple moon?
The moon is coming out.
He's right! The moon is purple!
That really gives me the creeps.
It's the curse.
This is the evil spell of the moon!
What?
They're...
What's going on?
The heck?
I apologize for startling you.
What in the world is this?
How awful...
How...
How cool!
Awesome! You got horns and spines and stuff!
How can I get some?
He thinks this is cool?
No one's ever said that before.
Hey, it's a real problem for them to look like this!
Really?
Oh, my bad. Guess we'd better do something about it.
He finally gets it.
Get a clue, seriously.
Returning to the matter at hand.
When the purple moon appears, we all change to these demonic forms.
If this cannot be called a curse, then what is?
When the morning comes, everyone returns to their previous forms,
however some never change back again!
Their very minds have been stolen from them.
That's...
The ones who have been turned into demons, who have lost their minds...
We have no choice but to kill them.
But there might be a way to return them to normal!
If we leave them be, then everyone would be killed by the demon!
Even when we lock them up, they destroy the jail.
So...
I killed my own son.
My son, whose mind was turned into that of a demon.
That's...
But yesterday, we...
Shh! I know why that guy disappeared.
He couldn't rest in peace, could he?
A ghost?
Please save this island!
If things stay like this, all of us will lose our minds and turn to demons!
We won't let that happen!
We'll do something about it!
There is only one way to rid us of the curse.
The moon...
Please destroy the moon.
The moon just keeps getting creepier the more you look at it.
Happy, hurry and close the window.
The chief explained, remember?
If we get exposed to too much moonlight, we'll turn into demons ourselves.
Anyway, I dunno...
Do they seriously expect us to destroy the moon?
Who knows how many punches it'll take?
You're planning on destroying it?!
What are you thinking?
Yeah. I don't think there's a wizard that could actually do that.
But destroy the moon is the request.
If we accept a request and can't complete it, it'll look bad for Fairy Tail.
We can't do the impossible!
And how did you plan on getting to the moon anyway?
Happy.
Uh, not happening.
Well, he said to destroy the moon, but if we poke around maybe we can find another way to lift the curse.
Walking all day after the shipwreck... I'm beat.
Why are you stripping?
Right! So tomorrow we go exploring the island.
Now to bed!
Aye, sir!
We'll think about it tomorrow.
Yeah. I'm tired, too. Let's go to sleep.
How am I supposed to sleep between a beast and an exhibitionist!
It's early...
Really damn early...
It's your fault I couldn't sleep.
Now get motivated and get going!
'kay...
Gate of the Clock, I open thee!
Horologium!
The time is 7:48.
You think we can really lift the curse without destroying the moon?
Well what other choice do we have?
And even if we could destroy it, it's a bad idea!
We wouldn't have the moon-viewing festival anymore!
That's true! We'd never eat the limited-time-only Fairy Tail Moon-View Steak again?
I don't know what I'd do if my favorite Moon-View Salted Fish was gone...
Hey you two! I don't know what you're blabbing about, but keep it down, will you?
Walk on your own.
Hey, can you really use Celestial Spirits like that?
We're up against a curse here, you know.
It's scary when it's something ephemeral.
That's what I call an S class quest!
I'm fired up!
I'll freeze that curse up no prob! Nothing to be scared of!
You guys really are idiots she says.
Aye!
What's that?
W-What the heck?
It's huge!
Hurry up and get it, guys! she says.
Ice Make Shield!
Hey, what's the matter?
Wait, when did you get in here?
Aye! they say.
Eww!
A mouse?
Natsu's down!
He's got a strong sense of smell.
Run away!
Ice Make Floor!
Do that from the start!
No complaining!
Look, there's some kind of building.
Let's go in there while we have the chance.
Beat it up while we have the chance!
Guys...
Temple of the Moon.
Quite large.
It's falling apart.
What era is this thing from?
What?
The moon, huh?
The island was originally called The Island of the Moon.
Island of the Moon, the moon's curse, moon symbols...
These ruins are really suspicious.
But they're in horrible shape.
Is this floor even safe?
Hey, stop that!
Natsu, you idiot! Look what you did!
Hey, is everyone okay?
No, not at all thanks to you!
Why can't you think before destroying things, you idiot!
Happy, can you fly up with everyone?
I can't...
Underground ruins, huh?
It's a secret cave!
We're here and all, so let's go exploring!
That's enough running amuck out of you!
Natsu?
What's the matter?
What is this?
This is...
Deliora!
You're joking... Why is Deliora here?
I can't believe this!
There's no way it'd be in a place like this!
You know this thing?
That's...
That's...
Gray, calm down.
So, what is it?
It's Deliora.
Demon of Disaster.
Demon of The Ashtray?
Disaster.
It's just like it was back then.
What the hell happened?
You heard people's voices around here?
It's noon, I'm sleepy.
Toby, you got exposed to the Moon Drip?
You got like, ears and stuff!
No dude! They're like, fashion, yo!
Just teasing, you dolt.
Yuka, you're so mean.
Moon Drip?
Are they talking about the curse?
Yuka-san, Toby-san, I bring sad news.
It's you, Sherry.
Angelica has been bullied by someone.
It's a mouse, dude! Don't give it no fancy name!
She is not a mouse!
Angelica is a hunter that runs through the darkness...
And... love!
We've got some serious weirdos here.
Especially that last one.
They're not from this island.
They smell different.
And they don't seem like they're cursed either.
Intruders?
And we haven't collected all the moonlight we need yet!
How vexing!
Let us exterminate the intruders before Reitei-sama hears of them.
Yes.
Before the moon's true form appears.
Yeah.
We can't let them survive if they've seen Deliora.
We must put intruders to sleep for eternity.
In other words... love!
You mean, death?
What's that?
It's over there.
Good job.
Aye.
What? Why don't we catch'em and make'em answer questions?
Not yet. Let's look around a bit more.
This has gotten kind of complicated.
Who is this Reitei-sama person?
Why the heck did they bring Deliora here?
And how did they find the place it was sealed anyway?
The place it was sealed?
This thing was sealed in a glacier on the northern continent.
An immortal demon that ran rampant ten years ago in the land of Isvan.
The demon who Ul, the wizard who taught me magic, gave her life to seal away!
I don't know what connection it has to the curse on this island,
but this thing should never be here!
Who the hell is this Reitei person?
I ain't gonna let you get away with throwing dirt on Ul's name!
Take me away to someplace!
Let's ride on a tin horse, just the two of us.
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
It's sad that my beloved doll can't talk to me...
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
Every time I think of you tears start to flow...
I'm a crybaby, aren't I?
In the moon (the moon) at night (at night)
I'm always (I'm always)
searching for the rabbit!
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
so much it's like I'm under a spell.
This love is a monologue
from which I'll never awaken.
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
since I've completely fallen in love.
I wonder what spell I could chant,
to get through to you?
The perfect thing to say.
Spouting this and that,
I just love you like crazy!
One day I want to be able to tell you
You got me.
My words of thanks.
There's nothing more to say!
Natsu, have you heard of this Moon Drip?
What's that?
I don't really know, but it says it's something about drips from the moon.
Wait, could it be food?!
Aye!
It's got to be candies!
They make them by concentrating moon juice!
Sounds delicious!
Next time: Moon Drip!
Wait, how do you squeeze out moon juice?
You'll have to wait for the next episode!
Gotcha! I can't wait for these Moon Drops!
