All of a sudden, I was there.
I was there, all alone.
My parents went into the dungeon to make money,
and died quickly.
To survive...
Just to survive...
I struggled.
You're cutting into my profits!
Hurry up!
Stand up already!
Here.
Beaten,
exploited...
Even if I ran away.
Even if I hid...
They would find me.
My home
was stolen from me.
I hate adventurers.
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Liliruca Arde Reason
This is wonderful!
It's been so long since I've had any Soma!
So, Goddess Loki,
you say that it's not their god that the Soma Familia worships,
it's that wine?
That's not quite correct.
This insanely expensive stuff is, to them, a failure.
What they worship is the perfected stuff, which they won't sell to anybody.
Perfected?
That's right.
It's dangerous.
One sip can get you wasted, to the bottom of your soul.
All the children of the Soma Familia are only there to drink it.
Only the drink connects them.
No way...
That's all the Soma Familia is?
That's all.
It takes money to really focus on brewing.
The ones who make a lot of money get a little drink of the perfect stuff.
And once you've had it, you want it again,
so you're desperate for cash.
You'll take every valis you can get,
even if it means screwing your companions,
or sacrificing others.
Well, that's about all I know.
Did that help, Eina-chan?
Yes. Thank you.
Hey, Aiz-tan!
How long are you going to be glum,
just because your man ran off on you?
Let's update your status!
Okay? Okay?
Understood.
I'll touch your soft skin all over!
If you do anything weird, I'll stab you.
Seriously?
She's an interesting goddess, isn't she?
Interesting or not, she's far sharper than she looks.
And we trust her implicitly.
Even if it means sacrificing others, huh?
We've got Level 6 here!
I see.. it's that supporter, huh?
Yes. It looks like there are bad adventurers after her.
I was hoping we could let her stay here for a while.
Bell-kun.
Yes?
Is your supporter really trustworthy?
I'm sorry. It's a bad thing to say, but I have to say it.
From everything you've said,
she seems really shady.
Think about it.
Did you really lose your knife?
It's the same with those adventurers who were attacking her.
She's hiding something from you.
Goddess...
The tenth floor?
Yes. Do you want to go there today?
You're strong enough to do it!
But I only survived the seventh floor because of your magic weapon...
And starting on the tenth floor...
Large monsters start showing up.
As strong as you are now, you won't have any problems!
Like that magic you showed me yesterday!
You can do it.
I've been down to the eleventh floor, and I guarantee it.
I was planning on talking to Hestia soon,
but I didn't think I'd be asked to do the Babel inspection.
I shouldn't involve my job with my personal life,
but it's for the best, right?
I need to talk to her about Bell-kun's supporter.
Thank you for agreeing to my plan!
I'm really lucky to be a supporter for someone like you!
Oh, well...
I guess have to go to the tenth floor at some point.
So, um...
This isn't really my place to say anything, but...
Why not use this from now on?
A baselard?
Yes. Your current weapon
doesn't quite have the reach needed to fight a large monster.
All right. I'll borrow this.
Bell-sama...
Okay!
Let's go, Lili!
Yes, Bell-sama!
I saved the adventurer you're in charge of?
Yes.
I've been wanting to thank you.
I heard you saved him at the last second from a raging minotaur
on the fifth floor.
A minotaur?
Yes.
His name's Bell Cranel.
U-Um... Miss Wallenstein?
Is he afraid of me?
H-Huh?
Not at all!
He's very grateful to you for saving him!
Really?
Really!
I'm so glad...
So the white-haired kid is about to get set up for a fall by Arde?
Yup.
And you know what'll happen then.
Don't screw it up, you guys.
I know!
It can't be...
Is something wrong?
Miss Wallenstein, I'm aware that this is rude,
but may I ask you a favor?
So this is the tenth floor?
Yes. This is our goal for today.
It's dangerous, so stay close, Lili.
Yes, Bell-sama.
Lili, what's this?
That's a Landform...
But it looks like you don't have time to cut them all down.
It really is big...
You mustn't run, Bell-sama.
You're right.
If I can't beat an orc,
I'll never beat the monsters that come after this!
Yeah, like that minotaur...
The Landform?
It's becomes a weapon?!
Bell-sama, it's coming!
What are you thinking, Miss Advisor?
You're here on guild business, right?
Do you have time to spend talking to me?
I wanted to talk to you about that supporter of Bell-kun's.
I think...
Okay!
Bell-sama! Another one's coming!
Firebolt!
Firebolt!
I did it...
I did it, Lili!
Lili, where are you?
Oh, no. Did a monster get her?
Those items...
They're monster lures!
Lili, where are you?
Fireb
Lili, where are you?
Answer me!
Lili!
Lili, what are you doing?
Sorry, Bell-sama.
This is the end.
You heard everything from that guy, didn't you?
Wh-What?
Find a good opportunity to escape, okay?
Goodbye, Bell-sama!
Lili!
Lili!
You're too nice.
The midnight bell tolls, Cinderella.
This is your fault, Bell-sama.
If only you hadn't met him...
No, this is the right thing to do.
Bell-sama's an adventurer, too.
One of those adventurers that I hate.
A Hephaestus weapon...
I can sell this anywhere.
I may even get enough money to reach my goal.
This is for my freedom.
I need money to leave the Familia, so...
Isn't that nice?
You got a big haul.
You've screwed with me for too long, you goddamn prum!
Look at you, you little thief.
I thought you were going to be getting rid of that kid soon.
I figured if I laid a trap here, I'd be sure to find you.
A trap?
There aren't a lot of paths you can use on this floor.
There are three more of us at the other routes.
But you came to see me!
This is pretty good stuff!
You've even got a magic weapon!
You've been having a good time, haven't you?
Oh, there you are. You're early.
Look at this brat.
She even had a magic weapon!
You were right.
She's been saving up.
I see.
Hey, so I wanted to ask you something...
You think you could leave all her stuff here?
A killer ant?
D-Do you know what you're doing?
Yes.
A dying killer ant will send out a signal to summon its fellows.
Every adventurer knows that.
A-Are you insane?
You bastards...
You don't want to end up a meal for them while you're fighting us, do you?
Damn it all!
Hey, Arde.
This looks pretty bad, doesn't it?
We're both part of the same Familia, right?
I'll save you, so give me everything you have.
Or do you think you can fool me like yesterday?
If you do...
All right!
I understand, so...
This is a key to a gnome safe.
I converted the money to jewels and hid them there.
So this is it, huh?
K-Kanu-san...
Look around, Arde.
This looks pretty dire, doesn't it?
So you get to be our decoy.
But that wasn't the deal...
What kind of adventurer keeps a promise made to a supporter?
We don't need you anymore.
Keep supporting us till the end of your life, supporter!
This is why I hate adventurers.
But, I guess... this is what I deserve for deceiving Bell-sama, who was so nice to me.
If that's true, then maybe I should give up.
But it hurts.
God, why...?
Why did you make me like this?
I hate myself for being so weak and small.
And nothing ever changes for me.
I was so lonely.
I wanted to be with someone.
I wanted to be needed.
But...
It's over now.
I can finally die.
I can finally end this.
The me who can't do anything.
The weak me.
The small me.
The worthless me.
The lonely me.
I'm finally going to...
Lili!
Am I going to die?
Firebolt!
Please, Goddess Hestia.
I'll try to convince him, too.
Please tell Bell-kun to fire his supporter.
It won't work.
Huh?
He's already made his decision.
No matter what happens, he won't abandon that supporter.
Firebolt!
Goddess... even if that's true,
if she's in trouble, I want to help her.
She looks so lonely.
Like I was before I met you!
Lili, you're safe, right?
Did they hurt you?
Bell-sama...
How did you get here?
I couldn't really see it in the fog,
but after you left another adventurer came, I guess,
and all the orcs around me disappeared.
So I was able to follow you quickly.
I'm glad I made it in time.
Why?
Why? Why did you save me?
Why aren't you abandoning me?
Wait, do you not understand that I was tricking you?
Do you think I stole your knife as a joke?
Lili!
What is wrong with you?
Are you a moron? An idiot?
A complete fool?
Lili, calm down!
I can't!
You didn't notice anything!
I lied to you about how much money I got for trading in the magic stones!
Our share wasn't 50-50!
It was 40-60! Some days I got cocky and even made it 30-70!
And when you asked me to go pick up items,
I told you the items cost more than twice what they really did!
I've even said really mean things about you behind your back!
Don't you understand?
I'm a bad person!
A thief!
I'm the worst kind of prum! I've done nothing but lie to you!
Will you... Will you save me anyway?
Yup.
Why?
Because you're a girl?
You dummy!
Not this again!
Will you save any woman just because she's a woman?
I can't believe you!
You're horrible!
You philanderer!
Womanizer!
Pervert!
Enemy of womankind!
Then it's because you're you.
I wanted to save you because you're you.
I didn't want you to leave, because you're you.
I can't find another reason.
I don't need another reason to save you.
Lili, if you're in trouble, talk to me.
I'm an idiot, so I won't understand unless you say something.
But I'll save you.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Eina-san.
It looks like I really had you worried.
And I lost your protector.
It's okay.
As long as you're safe.
So what are you going to do now?
Miss Supporter! Miss Supporter!
Are you looking for an adventurer?
Are you confused?
But it's actually quite simple.
A rookie adventurer who wants the help of a supporter is advertising himself.
Bell-sama...
Will you go back into the dungeon with me, Lili?
Yes.
Bell-sama!
I still wasn't able to apologize.
What's this?
