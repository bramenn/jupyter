Heads down!
I win!
It's her 183rd consecutive win.
Okay, who else wants to play?
Isn't there anyone who can beat Kyono?
The rules are simple.
You lost too, Izo.
Hey, you and you there! Want to try?
Okay, who's next?
Shut up!
Here doggy, doggy!
Shake hands! C'mon, shake hands!
Shut up, I'm a wolf!
C'mon Izo, be nice to the kids.
How very immature...
Lan!
Are you all right?
Bad doggy got scolded!
Woof woof!
You brats!
Huh? What happened to your haunted house?
You mean you can't tell?
No one wants to come.
Really? I wonder why.
Because you're taking them all away!
Huh? How so?
Forget it already.
After we worked so hard on it.
What a waste...
Okay, next up...
Get ready, guys!
Time for watermelon!
The Kamogawa Experiment
The Kamogawa Experiment
Here's what we got from Laffinty after granting her asylum.
This is Le Garite's data on the Vox Particle Control Experiment
that they conducted on Laffinty and Lympha?
Apparently, the results weren't very promising.
This confirms our suspicions.
Dizelmine plans to use the Vox's power...
He believes that if he can completely control the power of Vox,
it would be possible for them to destroy planets.
Militia Zodia...
This is obviously why Villagiulio won't stand down.
And neither will we, of course.
Madoka...
Here! First come, first serve!
I'll have this one!
How about you, Lan?
Give me one too!

We told you, we just aren't getting anyone.
Really? How strange.
Haunted houses are usually pretty popular.
So what's up?
Maybe it's too hot in there?
It's way too hot in there!
There's no AC, so it's like a sauna. It's unbearable.
That's why ghosts are supposed to put a chill in the air.
Do we look like ghosts to you?
Can you just let us be?
I've got chills!
The Intergalactic Conference will take place here in Kamogawa a week from today.
Representatives from various planets
Kamogawa's Event of the Century!!
Kamogawa's Event of the Century!!
Conference Just One Week Away
Conference Just One Week Away
have already started arriving one after the other.
As the host city this year, Kamogawa has planned many events
to help our guests understand Kamogawa culture,
and preparations are well under way.
Hey, you two!
Do you think your big brothers have already arrived?
I don't know.
I haven't received any messages, so...
Um...
Oh, that's right!
Before the Intergalactic Conference, Asteria plans to have a... Uh, what did she call it, a three-way meeting?
Sounds like something a school guidance counselor would do.
Hey, maybe she's planning to do the same thing?
Anyway, that's what she's doing!
Right?
Uh-huh...
Am I saying all the wrong things today?
But, but...
I don't know exactly how to put it.
But if your brothers talk it out
just like you two did the other day...
I'm sure they'll be able to...
Anyway, if there's anything that I can do,
I'll do anything for you two. Absolutely anything!
Uh-huh...
Thank you, Madoka.
Sure!
Your Majesty, what about the situation with Lady Lan? Leaving her be?
Yes, let her be for now.
By the way...
Yes?
What is De Metrio up to?
Ever since Villagiulio went public about the existence of Ignis,
a few members of the Polyhedron are beginning to show support for De Metrio.
To think someone would actually take his side...
They are only going to regret
the foolish choice they've made later.
Even if they beg for their lives, I'll show them no mercy.
Huh? An experiment?
That's right.
You don't mean...
Yes.
The Vox Particle Control Experiment.
Oh...
Madoka, do you get what she's saying?
That experiment digs deeply into the test subject's psyche.
Depending on the circumstances,
it can cause severe damage to their personality.
It's extremely dangerous.
With me, the experiment was halted before it reached its final stage.
I'm pretty sure that's what saved me.
If it had continued, there's a chance I wouldn't be here right now.
Lan...
Ms. Chairman, why would you put Madoka through this experiment?
Huh?
You must be bored just sitting there.
Take one.
Huh?
I said, take one.
This is the one I want to show you.
What does that look like to you?
Well... A chalice?
Two people facing each other?
You're both right.
Oh!
It's all in the eyes of the beholder.
It depends on your viewpoint.
The Vox is considered a military weapon.
But I believe its power could be used for something else.
Something else?
Yes. This may sound ridiculous, but if we can use
that immeasurable energy for peaceful purposes...
And if we can demonstrate that at the Intergalactic Conference,
Dizelmine and Villagiulio would be prevented
from using the Vox as a weapon. Don't you think?
All right, I'll do it!
Madoka...
This is going to be very hard for you. You know that, right?
Uh-huh.
But if there's a way to use Midori as something besides a robot, I want to try it.
So I'll do it!
Madoka, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but...
Don't worry, leave it to me!
Didn't I just tell you?
If there's anything at all that I could do to help,
I'd do absolutely anything for you two!
Madoka...
Madoka!
If you're going for it, make sure you get results!
Okay!
Now that it's decided, let's not waste any more time!
If any of the sensors
all over your body come off, we'll have to re-attach them.
Rechecking stability.
Rechecking experiment procedures.
Do your best to endure.
Progress rate at 90 percent.
Deployment complete.
All control stations have been notified.
Switching from pattern A to C.
Please hurry and complete final checks.
A, as in apple.
Sensors activated.
Checking measuring instruments.
Progress rate is 97 percent.
L, as in letter. B, as in boy.
R, as in Romeo.
Roger. Connecting now.
If things go the way Asteria wants,
Madoka won't have to get mixed up in war.
Right?
Yes, that's why...
You support this?
I feel the same way.
Progress rate at 99 percent.
All systems go.
All systems go.
All systems go.
Looks like we're ready.
Good...
Madoka, are you ready?
Yes.
Here we go!
Craft has reached an altitude of 50,000 meters.
Aura is switching to stable mode.
It's going well.
We can link the Bio Telepathic Control Wave of the pilot
to Aura at any time.
Madoka!
Yes?
Just relax and embrace your surroundings.
Got it!
Now guiding her consciousness to a subconscious level.
Placing stress over her consciousness with hypnotherapy.
She's not responding to any of it.
She's either dense or really tough.
Well, normally I'd praise her, but in this case,
it's not helping the experiment.
Increasing stress levels.
We've penetrated quite deep into her subconscious, but...
Any further and we might damage the CIB
and she could be left with lingering aftereffects.
Let's stop here, for now.
Huh? Huh? Huh?!
Hey, what's going on?
I don't feel anything.
Can you wait a minute?
Excuse
Vox Particles appear during times
of intense anger, sadness, or hatred.
At least they're supposed to.
Could she be immune to artificial stimulation of the mind?
Miss Kyono always seems to exceed our expectations.
She's impossible to predict.
Enough!
That's enough!
Are you still going to continue?
Ma'am?
Ms. Chairman?
Resume transmission.
R-Right!
Um, did you get any results?
Kyono Madoka.
Yes?
You're a virgin, aren't you?
W-Wha
What kind of question is that?!
Right on the mark.
What a waste, when you have such a beautiful body.
Asteria?
Is it that much fun with just three girls?
What the hell does that have to do with the experiment?!
A lot.
What?!
Aside from anger, sadness, and hate,
the biggest trigger for human emotions
is shame.
Besides...
This way, she won't have to worry about any lasting trauma from the experiment.
Probably not.
Madoka...
I bet that body of yours is frustrated at times.
Frustrated?
Frustrated how, exactly?
For example...
Her telepathic control waves are rising!
What?!
Vox Particle Density at 300, 400...
Oh, my...
It's over 500!
That worked quite well.
That's not fair!
So not fair!
Hey Asteria!
You have no idea how embarrassing this is!
Lan and Muginami are the only ones I've ever even kissed!
What's wrong with that, huh?!
Madoka...
I can't take it anymore!
Vox Particle Density at 1200... 1600...
It's accelerating rapidly!
That girl has quite the dirty mind.
I wonder what she's picturing in her mind right now.
Well, it must be X-rated! No one under 18 permitted!
Decrease the stress level.
Right!
Level decreased.
Density stable at 1800.
Both the Le Garite and De Metrio are contacting us.
Both sides are trying to reach us right this moment, huh?
Are they competing to get permission first?
I must say, they fight over such trivial things.
Give the go-ahead.
Yes'm.
Shouldn't we stop the experiment?
You're right.
I suppose we have no choice.
Get Madoka and Aura to return immediately.
Roger.
The Vox Particle Density is rising!
It will hit 2500 shortly!
What?
These are the same numbers when the last Rinne opened up.
Get me an outside view!
What is that?!
What on earth is that red thing?
It's like blood spewing out.
Madoka!
Militia Zodia...
Vox Aura...
Kyono Madoka!
The Vox Particles at the observation point are still rising!
Please respond!
Vox Aura!
Please respond!
We are switching from Code Green to Red!
Repeat, Code Red!
Please respond!
Switch from Pattern C to F complete!
Please respond!
Put Pharos in emergency mode.
The Rinne...
Yeah... I guess that's true.
Maybe she's right.
I mean, I'm going to be a mother someday, too.
Before that, I need to have...
Stupid, stupid! What am I thinking?!
Huh? When did...
How?
Red inside green?
Why? Why can't you understand?
Aura has exceeded its maximum speed in space!
What? What happened?
We're disconnected from Aura!
Huh? I can hear you!
Hey, what's going on?!
Hey!
Unidentified crafts have suddenly appeared
and have Aura surrounded.
Who do they belong to?
We don't know!
What?
Get Aura back stat!
The auto-pilot isn't working!
Our transmission is being blocked.
Absolutely unforgivable...
Unforgivable!
I've met you before...
It's a fact that you were chosen.
The rest is up to you.
Why would you let it repeat itself?!
Huh?
Do you intend to destroy the world?!
Don't open the Rinne!
I alone will suffice!
W-Why?
Remember!
Just by being there, life is...
I don't understand it...
Close...
Close!
I have vitals!
Thank goodness!
What about the unidentified crafts?
They've been destroyed.
Can we get through to Madoka?
Our comms are dead.
What an ironic turn of events.
We have demonstrated that the Vox's power is unprecedented.
And not only is it known to us,
but to many others here.
Is this the power of Aura...
No, of Kyono Madoka?
It's the power of Vox, given only to those who have the Memoria.
Now that you've seen it, what will you do...
Young King Dizelmine of Le Garite?
There you are Lord Dizelmine!
Yes.
It's tea time!
Yurikano made you some delicious herb tea.
Tell me, Midori... What happened?
What happened?
In the next episode, the historic conference between Lan and Muginami's brothers will finally take place!
I'm starting to get nervous too!
Lan's brother! Can you give us a comment about your thoughts for the conference?
Could you please not talk to me?
How about a word from Big Brother Giuvi?
Don't talk to me either, Madoka.
This is worse than I thought.
A Reunion in Kamogawa
