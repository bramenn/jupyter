Why are you here?!
I told you to be ready for a battle of endurance.
Why are you getting so mad? I'm your girlfriend
Sitting around won't close the gap with Chizuru-san. You live in the same building.
Meanwhile, your workplace is Chizuru-san free!
We can spend quality time together!
D-Do you have any intention of working?!
Ouch! This is domestic violence!
Also, being neighbors doesn't mean anything! We barely ever interact!
Boss, I'm being bullied!
I demand you dock his pay!
That way, he can't afford rentals.
Okay. I'll trash his time card.
She's got him wrapped around her finger!
Rental girlfriend skills in action?
What's the problem? I'm free to work where I please, aren't I?
Okay, let's get you up to speed on your job.
Sure thing!
O God of Campus Life! Shine a ray of hope on me!
Welco...
Whoa, he's really here.
He's in uniform and all.
Ew.
We'll take the free time option.
Room 5 is all yours.
Room 5?
Ew.
Put your dick in a uniform or something, bro.
Ew.
There is no God.

You have a new message.

What's this about Kuri?
Well, he's been acting weird lately.
This guy's Iwafune
He's been coming to college,
but it's like, I dunno... the lights are on, but nobody's home.
You might remember him from his brief appearance in the pub scene
Scene? What's that supposed to mean?
Makes sense!
Dick! Dick!
So I did some digging.
Look at this.

Wait, how do you know his private account?
In cyberspace, I see all.
You know anything, Kazu-chin?
Huh? O-Oh, not at all.
I do! I know way too much!
Kuribayashi-san, thank you for renting me the other day.
He liked Ruka-chan for real, huh?
(Intro: approx. 90 seconds)
Anyway, you look out for him, too.
Y-Yeah, of course.
What? Kuribayashi-san?
I just think you should apologize to him or something.
Hmm... But he's old news for me now.
Mean!
But hey, he paid you.
And what you did was out of bounds for a rental girlfriend.
I haven't gone back to that job since we started dating!
If you want me to quit, just say the word!
Besides, I tried to keep his secret! You're the one who followed me!
W-Well, yeah, but then you showed up at our college.
Honestly, I do feel bad for Kuribayashi-san,
but I needed to do that in order to date you.
And I was just a rental.
If I met him outside of work and he fell for me, I'd be digging my own grave.
Uh, I'm pretty sure it's too late already.
Anyway, forget that!
I found a great pastry cafe! How does this Saturday sound?

Jeez, don't stare so hard.
No, no! It'll make Ruka-chan mad!
I need to be smart with money!
Anyway, you look out for him, too.
I wonder what Kuri's up to right now.
I could take him out for drinks.
But I guess it'd still be too awkward with just the two of us.
I did start it all by being a tryhard and showing Mizuhara off.
Anyone would want a girlfriend after meeting one like her.
He said he was going back to the sticks to run his family's apple orchard after college...
What if he remains a bachelor for life because of me?!
Kuribayashi Shun
Another year, another batch of beautiful and juicy Fuji apples! hOver the last 40 years, I've watched this orchard grow into hha treasure trove. Too bad it'll die with me, though.

K-Kill me now!
It'd probably just annoy him if a guy with a girlfriend tried to cheer him up.
There's nothing I can do...
Wait, that's it!
That's a genius idea!
Yes?
It's me.
Excuse me? What do you think you're doing, ringing my intercom like it's nothing?!
Ichinose
Sorry about that.
But I need you to do something for me.
And what's that?
Why should I?
Please, it's for a friend!

Please!
At least tell me what this is about.
I should just leave.
How am I even supposed to face him?
He has no idea what I've gone through since that day!

Is he drunk!?
You've got a super hot girlfriend!
You wouldn't know how it feels to rent one!
Is he trying to cheer me up?
Thank you for renting me the other day.
I hate you!
W-Wait!
Misaki!
Pathetic.
I'm leaving, dude.
If I'm just gonna embarrass myself, I'm done with love!
Oh, there you are!
Thank goodness! Shun-kun, right?
I've never been here before, so I got lost.
Shall we go?
I've planned out our date and everything.
Uh, h-hang on! Aren't you...
Hello.
I'm Mizuhara Chizuru, your rental girlfriend.
Sweat
What's going on? Why's Chizuru-san here?
We're going on a date? She's a rental girlfriend?!
What is she talking about? Like I'd fall for that!
Right. Time to Google.
Rookie Batch
This Month's
Are you kidding me? What is all this?
Does that mean you weren't really Kazuya's girlfriend?
No answer? So I'm right?
What... Their relationship was purely rental, just like Ruka-chan and me?
Let's go, Shun-kun.
Get a load of that chick.
What a cutie!
Is that her boyfriend?
Her boyfriend's so lucky.
They're holding hands!
Think he's plowed her?
What the hell? What the hell is happening?
Asakusa Hanayashiki
Asakusa Gate
They even have a merry-go-round!
I've wanted to come here for so long!
Uh, the date's already in progress?
I still can't believe Chizuru-san was a rental girlfriend, though.
Maybe she's dating Kazuya for real?
The way they've been acting is nothing like a rental relationship!
Hell, Kazuya even jumped off a ferry for her!
We have to put these on our wrists.
Also, like, what does he get out of telling me like this?
If he couldn't keep lying to me, he could've just told me himself!
Monitoring
Cackle
You've been had!
Fondle
They must be messing with me!
S-Sorry, I think I'm just gonna bounce.
I've, uh, got something to do.
There's an assignment due.
Oh, too bad. You can't just ignore that.
Y-Yeah. Sorry about this.
I'm not gullible enough to play along with this farce!
I guess I'm doing this alone, then.
What?!
G-Going to the amusement park alone?!
Yeah. I've been looking forward to it.
I don't know about that!
I already bought the tickets, though.
Chizuru-san turned into a ghoul!
See you.
Chizuru-san... alone in the amusement park?
Gossip
A-Ahem!
I can't call myself a man and let that happen.
Please sit tight until we begin.
Yay, I can't wait. It's been too long.
Oh, sorry. I'll scoot over.
Sh-She's so close!
What is this sweet scent?
Where am I, in a field of flowers?!
This is cool.
Yeah, Chizuru-san is peak girl.
Her voice, speech, and mannerisms are all perfect.
Every man's dream girl!
If nothing else, I'm sure Kazuya likes her for real.
Haunted House
Sorry, I'm not good with scary stuff.
So close again!
Squeeze!
Whoa, I feel'em! I can feel them!
S-Sorry.
I-It's totally fine.
They used to call me William Shun through grade school.
I can't! I can't just go on a normal date with a girl I thought was my friend's girlfriend!
Once I've locked onto a girl's heart, I never miss!
Wait, what am I even saying?!
You're so funny, Shun-kun.
Skyship
Thank you.
Ba-dump
What is wrong with me?
I said all that, and here I am having fun.
Boys are so stupid, seriously.
I mean, we're talking rental girlfriends here.
You pay for a date, and that's that.
It's not like we don't get it.
But when it's a gorgeous girl like you, it really makes us think.
We fall for you. We wanna hold you in our arms.
We're so childish, all of us.
But I like boys.
O-Oh, I don't mean that in a salacious way!
Absolutely not!
R-Right...
I didn't take it that way...
Sure, you do have your childish side, but that just means you're romantics.
Being pragmatic in life is a difficult thing,
but it's even harder to continue to be a dreamer.
Chizuru-san...
We can't do as much for you as real girlfriends can,
but we can be band-aids and stop the bleeding.
Life must be so rosy with a girlfriend like her.
Hey, Kazuya, you're envied wherever you go.
You smell heaven right by your side.
She laughs at your stupid jokes.
You go on dates every day, hold hands,
and have sex until you're sick of it...
Man, I really do want one.
I want a girlfriend!
Rent - A - Girlfriend
Wow.
It was so crowded during the day, but we practically have the place to ourselves now.
Thanks for today, Chizuru-san.
You heard about Ruka-chan, right?
And that's why you two planned this to cheer me up, right?
I was so confused at first, but I had loads of fun!
Oh, I should pay up.
Sorry.
I've already been paid.
What? How?
K-Kazuya?!
What're you doing over there?
U-Uh, just, um... sightseeing?
Rattle
A-Awkward!
A-Awkward!
Sweat
Sorry, I need to visit the restroom.
S-Sure.
Mizuhara...
She decided to give us space...
Oh, so that's what happened.
Sorry I lied to you!
I rented her after the Mami heartbreak.
But then we ran into you and Kibe,
and I showed her off as my girlfriend to look cool.
There was no going back after that!
Shake
He's really mad!
What the hell, man? That's so lame!
For your grandma? Talk about giving back to your family!
Wait, does this even count as giving back?
Chizuru-san sure got stuck with one annoying client!
You're laughing too much! My hands were tied!
Guffaw Bwahaha
Is this guy trying to piss me off?
But man, I'm glad you're a stinky virgin like me.
I knew it was weird that a lameass like you landed a girl like her.
You're going there, dude?
Y'know, when you showed up with Ruka-chan in tow,
I nearly lost all faith in humanity's taste!
Y-You're one to talk!
Just so you know, Ruka-chan's younger!
Shut yer trap, pedo!
Mizuhara's got bigger boobs!
Excuse me?! Did you not see the legs on her, you uncultured tiddy freak?!
Mizuhara's got a sweet pair of legs herself!
Anyway, Chizuru-san's amazing.
I get what today was all about now.
She must've been freaking out, too,
but she never showed it.
No amount of money could make a person do all that.
I forgot all about the embarrassment a rental girlfriend caused me and just had fun.
Kuri...
Oh, Mizuhara's back.
Later. I don't want to take up any more of your date time.
Wha...
Date? It's just a rental thing!
And you made the booking!
Quit being a dork!
Did Kazuya-kun leave?
Oh, y-yeah.
Let's get going, then.
O-Okay.
Oh, so he just showed up to apologize.
Not like I would've realized if they hadn't told me.
He's such a dork.
Who digs their own grave like that?
But why did Chizuru-san play along?
Chizuru-san.
Going back to that convo earlier...
You said all that, but you'd never fall for a client for real, right?
What? Me, go on a date with Kuri-kun?
Why should I?
Besides, do you even realize what that means?
I do.
But after all he's gone through, I'm sure he'll consider it a shared secret.
Of course, you should only do it if you're okay with it.
Even then, why go out of our way?
He's been down in the dumps since the Ruka-chan thing.
I don't want him to hate women over this. It was all my fault to begin with.
I know that going on a date with you would make anyone want a girlfriend.
Well, I do feel bad about the Ruka-chan thing,
and I have dealt with clients who have trust issues with women.
R-Really?
Fine. I'll do it, but just this once.
You mean it?
I don't want this to drag on any longer, though.
So I'll just do my job like always. Is that okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Are you sure, though?
You'll be the one embarrassing yourself when he learns the truth.
I was gonna tell them someday, anyway.
I'll just consider this a practice run.
Mizuhara Chizuru doesn't belong to anyone in particular, right?
It just wouldn't be fair to keep such a top-class girl to myself.
We wouldn't fall for a client...
I guess?
Who knows?
Chizuru-san?
Let me walk you to the station.
No, let me.
Nah, let me.
No way... No freakin' way, right?
O-Okay.
We're hitting up a breastaurant

Okay, my eyes aren't playing tricks on me. This really is a message from her!
Mizuhara's reaching out to me!
Who screams like that indoors?
STFU.
Gotta be casual, very casual.
Is she really sure about this?
A balcony rendezvous? Really?
She was the one who banned all interaction in our private lives!
But now she's asking to meet?!
Did she have a change of heart?
Pant
Sorry, I just had to see you tonight.
She's not that kinda girl.
hhhhhhh hhhShe'shhh hhhnothhh hhhthathhh hhhkindahhh hhhgirl.hhh hhhhhhhhh
Does my apartment stink?!
Any visible nostril hairs?!
Five minutes to go.
She might think I'm desperate if I go out there early.
STFU and go already.
Screw it. I'll just go.
STFU.
Actually, is she even gonna be here?
Heya.
H-Hey.
She's here!!
Sorry about this.
No biggie. You need something?
She really did want to talk to me!
I need your help with something.
My help?
There's this girl I want you to rent.
She's a newbie who just started working as a rental girlfriend.
The thing is, she's really shy.
So shy that clients are complaining about her.
A rental girlfriend... who's really shy?
I figured you'd be a safe bet since I know who you are and how you do things.
Of course, this is for practice, so you don't have to pay a dime.
You up for it?
S-Sure.
Great.
Oh, but don't you dare make a move on her.
I know that!
I know she's just a rental.
Have some faith in me, jeez.
So, how's it been going for you?
With your ex. Mami-chan, was it?
O-Oh.
Things went up in smoke at the beach, but you were getting cozy before that.
She's a vital piece of the puzzle when it comes to you getting a girlfriend, right?
We're totally on the outs.
She hasn't talked to me since then.
She probably couldn't care less about me now.
And honestly, I'm not even sure anymore, either...
whether I still like her or not.
But I did swear to myself that I'd make her happy.
Deleting those feelings so easily just seems shallow to me.
That so?
Well, rushing won't get you anywhere.
I'm here for you...
Until you forget her.
Mizuhara...
Okay, don't forget about that date. I'll let you know when and where later.
Hang on.
What's up?
Uh, what's up is...
Are you sure you should be... meeting me out here and stuff?
Huh? What was that? Quit mumbling and say it out loud.
Can't hear you through this wall
N-Nothing! Never mind!
Weirdo.
See you.
Hey, tell me her name.
Sakurasawa Sumi-chan. She's a college first-year.
Sweet scent
Wha?!
You're so childish

Sensei!
I need your help with homework!
Yo, I went and rented my very own angel.
Rented? You don't mean...
I know she's just a rental, but I don't wanna let her go anymore.
What kind of rental girlfriend could've made Kibe so serious?
What're you talking about?
I'm talking about this girl I ran into at the video rental shop.
It's a situational thing, so I don't know the actress's name,
but I've never seen a girl so in my strike zone...
Anyway, what's on the next episode of Rent-a-Girlfriend?
Truth...
I'll let you borrow it, Kazu-chin.
Th-Thanks, bro.
And me next!
God, these three stooges...
