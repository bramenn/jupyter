Fast as Wind Quiet as a Forest Daring as Fire Immovable as a Mountain
I'm hungry.
Dinner?
Dinner works.
I can offer to feed her.
Okay!
Hey...
Sour!
Get accepted to your first choice!
She brought food...
The Yamaguchis' Son, Kenji-kun
I am very pleased with who I am.
I never wanted for anything as a child,
and I easily accepted and met
the expectations of my parents and others.
I sound elitist?
If I'm not considered elite,
who is?
So then...
Why am I in this stuffy prep class?
Listen up!
College exams are a battlefield!
Fast as wind! Quiet as a forest! Bold as fire! Immovable as a mountain!
Damn, the more I see her, the harder she's studying.
How could I possibly be attracted to...

The pictures are ready.
That was fast.
Put a mark on the back if there's one you want.
I can make copies.
That was lots of fun.
Next year!
Next year, we only invite people who are really close!
People who are close?
You should bring your family then, Natsume.
What? M-My family...
Why are you so surprised?
Seriously...
Why does it have to be all or nothing?
Are you a robot?
You must have done a lot of spying to take all these.
Hey, that's uncalled for.
I've got even better ones.
How many pictures did you take, Sasayan?
Oshima-san happened to be there.
My face looks really round.
Hey! What was that for, Yoshida?
I didn't want to see that.
You shouldn't take it out on the picture.
Natsume-san, what are you doing?
Wait, what was I clapping for?
Shizuku, Shizuku.
Your underwear's showing in this one.
You're seeing things.
This one, too.
I want love!
I want love! Passionate love!
Up for another group date?
Wait, you have class again today, Yamaken?
Yeah.
Don't tell me that
you're seriously interested in the study bug.
I know it's almost Christmas, but that's just wrong.
Idiot, I'm not like you fools.
Hey, Joji.
Christmas with Everyone at RFC
See ya, Yamaken.
Don't look for girls on the Internet!
Oh, there you are! Yamaken, lookit!
Lookit?
From: Yumi-chan (No subject) Sorry... I'm not coming if Yamaguchi-kun isn't there... So don't talk to me.
That girl from Oto Girls' wants you to ask her out.
Oto Girls'?
Screw that.
Tell her to come ask me out if she's so interested.
What?
Otowa Girls' Academy?
I think she was pretty cute.
Oh, Yamaken, the door's not that way.
It's this way.
Be careful.
There you go.
I have no trouble getting women,
and that will never change.
Wha
Damn!
Yamaken-kun.
Hello.
So plain.
No difference from that woman I saw earlier.
Don't tell me that you're seriously interested in the study bug.
Am I supposed to hit on her?
I won't let myself sink that low.
Hey.
Excuse me.
Oh, thanks.
Get away from her, Yamaken.
Haru.
That hurt, bastard!
I hate it most when people touch my head!
Don't touch Shizuku.
You had a dirty look on your face.
The hell are you on?!
Haru.
I told you to stop following me.
I wasn't following you.
I was just passing by.
Yeah, this is stupid.
The hell you were!
Didn't you promise to care about the things I care about?!
Why is he so upset about this?
That's different. Doesn't count.
Does he have no pride?
Anyway, my response was made under
the assumption that I would be able to study.
My grades are still more important!
I love Haru.
It wasn't easy for me to confess my feelings.
I didn't want any more mistakes.
I wanted him to understand...
But then...
Th-That means you won't take the winter prep course?
In other words...
We won't get anywhere if I'm the only one
doing the right thing.
Sasaki Seminar
Man, there's a bump now.
Damn, he's too strong for his own good.
Is that where Haru hit you?
Does it hurt?
Not really.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for you to get involved.
Huh?
Why are you apologizing?
I decided to tell him how I feel,
but for some reason, he was jealous of you
and derailed the conversation.
Dammit.
Did I do something wrong?
I told her to wait.
Well, you make a nice couple,
since you're so similar.
There are two types of people.
Dumb people and smart people.
You dumb people can only focus on one thing at a time.
You can't see the big picture.
I'm on this side.
You guys are on the other side.
What makes us so different?
You wouldn't have to worry about
any of this if you went out with me.
What was that?
It sounded like I was hitting on her.
How can he be so confident?
Ow.
Oh, wow.
Ah, there's a bump.
You should put some ice on it.
Let's go.
I feel partially responsible.
Huh?
Oh...
No, it's okay.
Really?
If you say so.
Why did my heart just skip a beat?
Well, you should stay away from Haru,
and stay away from me.
Why should I give a damn about him?
You said that he's jealous?
What?
Are you bragging?
Bragging?
That wasn't my intention.
It just shows how much appeal you have.
Sasaki Seminar
Did you bring an umbrella?
Why?
It just shows how much appeal you have.
So she thinks I'm appealing?
Crap...
I can't stop smiling.
Yes!
Y-Yuu-chan, hold on.
I just saw someone grinning like a fool.
He did some kind of victory pose.
Huh?
What are you doing here, Yamaken?
Isn't your class over?
Are you lost again?
Buzz off.
Why are you still hanging around here?
Are you a stalker?
Not really.
I kinda spaced out and now it's dark out.
Wait, I just remembered...
He was definitely about to push me off.
Am I in danger here?
Come on.
Will the bus stop work for you?
Or are you scared of me?
Idiot, don't insult me.
Stop following me. It's creepy.
You probably think you're special because you
got a higher grade than me.
That's why you get bullied,
and I'm the one bullying you.
Got it? So watch yourself, newbie.
Got it, Yamaken.
Show some respect, Curly.
Curly?
And never walk in front of me.
You okay, Tomio?
Look out, Mabo!
Hey, aren't you guys finished yet?
Nice, Joji!
That's what you get!
Ow.
Hey.
Which one of you threw this guy?
You hit me.
Wait, aren't you...
Was it you?
Hey.
Huh?
You've changed.
Yo-Yoshida-kun thinks you guys are his friends.
So, if you consider him a friend,
you should be honest with him!
I've changed? Really?
I haven't changed.
Nothing's changed.
Shizuku's the one who keeps changing.
I can only wonder if she's going
to leave me behind one of these days.
Makes me consider tearing off her arms and legs.
Your ideas are scary.
Yeah.
Well, I wouldn't do it.
No kidding!
That's why...
I'm always looking up.
Bye.
Yeah.
Yamaken.
I wouldn't do that to Shizuku,
but everyone else is fair game.
Ow.
That was a lame threat.
Jealousy, huh?
I don't think it's simple jealously.
Whatever.
You just sit tight.
Wow, Haru!
You can become an entomologist when you grow up!
We don't have a choice.
It's what we have to put up with to stay in this house.
Why did you run away from home?
Did you think you could go back to Tone?
You're so dumb.
You and I have no place to go back to.
Yuzan!
Do you hate me now?
I wish I could.
Did you know, Haru?
You're the reason we were brought to this house.
I'm guessing you've never even tried to imagine
how I feel when I see you.
I've always wished that you didn't exist.
What are you doing, Haru?
Were you waiting for me?
H-How am I supposed to react?
Should I be happy?
You're my hero, Shizuku.
You're always there when I want to see you.
Huh? Weren't you waiting for me?
I love you...
So why am I the only one who has to show restraint?
You've been restraining yourself?
When and where?
I have.
I've been restraining myself like crazy.
I wanted to storm in your class and mess everything up.
If you do that, we're finished.
See?
Why do I have to suffer so much?
I love you.
I don't want you to hate me,
but I don't want you to leave me behind, either.
Huh? What?
What is he talking about?
What am I supposed to say?
I always believed
that if I told him and showed him how I felt,
everything would work out.
I need some peace of mind.
I want proof.
I want you!
That's...
That's not happening!
Why...
Why do we keep clashing?
I'm guessing that we're out of sync somehow,
but I don't know how to fix it.
I don't know the right answer.
