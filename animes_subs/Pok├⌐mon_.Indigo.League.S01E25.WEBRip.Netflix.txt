Ash and his friends arrive in Celadon City,
the great metropolis renowned for both its tall buildings
and for its good scents.
Mm. Pika!
-Something smells heavenly. -Perfume.
Hey, what's going on?
Eeh!
Wait, Brock! Where are you going?
Pokemon Scent-Sation!
Who are you making faces at, Brock?
My nose tells me that this is my kind of town.
Huh?
So, then he says maybe we can both go together.
I think we should stay here a while.
Well, if you want to waste your time.
Misty, Pikachu, let's get moving.
Misty? Pikachu?
Hm?
This scent is one of our most popular. It's called Daffodil Dreams.
- It smells just like a garden. -Pika!
We're having a fragrance sale.
-How much does this one cost? -Pikachu.
Don't buy it, Misty.
Perfume's just a waste of money, and it stinks.
Go away.
I resent that remark.
Huh?
The manager.
Young man, are you accusing me of overcharging my customers
for inferior perfume?
Uh, no, ma'am. I meant all perfumes are a rip-off
because all they do is turn guys into zombies, like this.
Hi, what's your name?
Hmm. Mm!
P for pretty, E for elegant, R for radiant,
F for fun, U for urbane, M for mysterious, E for energy,
-and that spells? -Perfume.
-Right! -Pika!
I don't need that smelly junk to give me energy. I'm full of it.
I got tons more energy than I know what to do with.
Why don't you use some of it to keep your mouth shut?
If you object to our products so much, perhaps you should leave,
since we all sell perfume here, you must find us offensive.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You insensitive little worm.
What did I say?
Get out and don't come back!
I don't want to come back!
I'm on my way to the Celadon City Gym.
What do you mean I can't I come in? I'm trying to become a Pokemon master.
I wouldn't let you in if you were the last Pokemon trainer on earth.
-Huh? -This Gym doesn't allow anyone inside
who says that perfume is a stinky rip-off.
Why not?
We manufacture that stinky perfume right here in this Gym.
Uh-oh.
So you see, young man...
- Ah! -You're the stinker!
But don't you understand?
I got to challenge your Gym Master so I can win a badge.
You've got to let me in!
Huh?
Pretty please, with a cherry on top?
Huh. Looks like the coast is clear.
Once we break inside, we'll steal the secret formula for their perfume.
Then I'll be as irresistible as Cleopatra.
I'll sell the formula and make myself zillions of bucks.
That's enough money to buy my own country,
or my own planet even.
Or nine lifetime supplies of cat grub.
That secret formula's got to be hidden around here somewhere. Hmm.
Now, where could it be?
Hmm.
Huh.
Ah!
What is it?
Hey, look.
What's a Gloom doing here?
Taking a nap, I think.
Gloom.
James, you've woken it up.
Go, Koffing.
Poison gas attack, now!
Koffing!
That Gloom just sucked up all of Koffing's gas.
I can't believe it.
Gloom?
Gloom, Gloom! Gloom!
It smells terrible!
It smells like old sneakers
mixed with some rotten eggs and dead fish with just a hint of skunk fumes.
- -My nose feels like it's on fire.
-Meowth, you don't have a nose. -Huh?
My nose! What happened?
The stink dissolved it off my face.
Hm? Oh. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
The cartoonist never gave me a nose. Hey, why are you sleeping?
That stopped them.
Gym rules, no thieves allowed.
Hey, get me down! Get me out of here!
You two clowns better get me out of this tree!
Don't tell me what to do, you little hairball!
I know what I'm doing.
-Are you three hanging out again? -Huh? The pest.
Please, could you help us get out of this tree?
-Traitor! -Ugh!
-How dare you collaborate with the enemy? -Whose side are you on?
Huh? Hmm. Hey, kid.
Bet they wouldn't let you in that Gym today.
That's none of your business.
They kicked you out.
Even though you're a pest, I'll make a deal.
Untie us and we'll show you how to get in that Gym.
Why should I trust you?
Face the facts, boy.
You can't get into the Pokemon League without winning more badges.
-Bing... -Bong...
Bing!
Ta-da!
Oh!
Great wig.
Not even your own mother would recognize you in this outfit.
Think so?
Talk about dressing for success, that getup will get you into the Gym easy.
Great! Then I'll show that Gym Leader who's the boss around here.
Uh, that doesn't sound very ladylike.
-Huh? -You'll give away your secret.
-Go on, try it. -Try it.
Ahem!
I'll show those meanies.
Good evening.
We would like to enroll our daughter, Ashley,
in your Pokemon training classes.
Nothing but the best for our little princess.
That's right.
- Ow! -Hm?
Do you like perfume?
Oh, yes.
Well, then, I'm sure you'll be accepted.
Your parents should apply at the desk.
Way to scam them, Goldilocks!
Are you applying to the Gym, little girl?
Uh, yeah.
The girl in the perfume shop.
I mean, yes, ma'am.
We're so proud to have our little muffin in your Gym.
-Yes, we sure are. -Cut it out.
Ma'am, where is Erika, the Gym Master?
Oh, you'll meet her soon.
All right. Now all I got to do is beat Erika, and I'll get another badge.
- Bye-bye. -Hmm?
Hugs and kisses, Ashley.
Mommy and Daddy are leaving you to battle those cute little Pokemon.
-Bye, sweetie. -See you soon.
Hmm. While that clueless little twerp creates a distraction,
-we'll steal the secret perfume formula. -Let's go.
Just one question,
what am I supposed to do with this blaster ball?
Stick it someplace where it'll make a nice, big kaboom.
They'll get a bang out of this.
Jessie, what's the blaster ball for?
Sweet revenge for stamping an on the most beautiful face in the world.
Talk about delusions.
What?
Uh, I mean, that'll teach those slobs.
One, two, one, two, one, two...
Remember, a pretty Pokemon is a strong Pokemon.
And so Omanyte bid farewell
and promised to one day return
to visit the friends who changed his life on that faraway beach.
The end.
-Great story. -Pika.
Uh-oh. How'd Misty and Brock get here?
- Trainer Erika. -Hm?
Erika.
I'd like to introduce our new student.
Ah!
The store manager.
Oh...
Nice to meet you.
Thank you, ma'am.
You sure are a shy young lady, but don't worry.
All the girls want to make you feel at home here at the Gym.
-Pikachu! -Oh!
Oh, great. Pikachu's here too.
May I ask you a question?
Of course you may, Misty.
I was wondering why we can all sit with Gloom.
I always thought that because of its terrible smell,
it was almost impossible to get anywhere near Gloom.
So how come this Gloom doesn't smell bad to me at all?
That's a very smart question, Misty.
Gloom doesn't have a bad smell all the time.
Whenever Gloom is in danger, it lets out the bad smell.
It's a natural defense mechanism.
But as long as Gloom doesn't feel threatened, it smells just fine.
Just make sure Gloom feels safe and show you want to be its friend.
-How do you know all that? -I met Gloom a long time ago.
Grimer!
When I was a little girl, I got lost one day and ran into a Grimer.
I'd never been so scared.
I couldn't even move.
Please, can you help me?
Please, help me.
Somehow that Gloom understood how scared I felt
and decided to come to my rescue.
Gloom!
Grimer!
I love you!
Gloom!
This is the same Gloom that rescued me from Grimer that day.
We've been friends ever since.
It's all because of her friendship with Gloom
that Erika decided to become a grass Pokemon trainer.
I wish Ash could've heard that story.
Ah! Uh...
Please don't stare at me like that. I'm a very shy little girl.
You look awfully familiar.
Haven't we met someplace before?
Maybe you met my sister.
-Pi? -Ah!
Pika-pi!
Hey, knock it off.
Pika!
It's Ash!
Yeah, it's me.
You're that boy.
Erika, you wouldn't let me in, so I wore this stupid disguise.
I had to sneak into your Gym so I could battle you for a badge.
And now I want to challenge you.
At last we've found the perfume.
Now we'll unlock its secret formula.
I accept your challenge.
It's my duty under the league rules. We'll each use three Pokemon.
Right. I'll use my own grass Pokemon against yours.
Bulbasaur, I choose you!
Bulbasaur!
This ought to be easy.
Tangela, I choose you!
What's that?
Tangela, a vine Pokemon.
Its body is wrapped in vines.
The rest of its form is hidden beneath these vines.
That doesn't tell me much.
All right, we'll attack from a distance.
Bulbasaur, vine whip!
Tangela, constrict! Resist it from pulling you in.
Bulbasaur!
-Ah! -Bulbasaur!
Tangela, now is the time to hit it with your stun spore.
Return, Bulbasaur!
Poor Bulbasaur!
Later I'll give you some Paralyze Heal to make your Pokemon better.
Thanks, but no thanks. I don't need your help.
I choose Primeape.
Uh, maybe I better not.
Charmander, go!
Charman.
This should be easy. Weepinbell, go!
-Bell. -Weepinbell, razor leaf now!
Charmander, flamethrower, full blast!
Char!
Yes, way to go. Now let's just finish it up.
Skull bash, now!
Uh! Weepinbell, return now!
-Ash is doing well. -He might actually win.
Yeah, he's a lot more impressive than he looks.
Your battle skills are impressive, Ash.
But there's one thing you don't have: empathy with your Pokemon.
Without it, you'll never become a great Pokemon trainer like me.
Now I'm going to give you a lesson in empathy.
Gloom, go!
Gloom.
Gloom!
Char! Char!
Oh! Charmander, return!
Poor Ash.
Your Pokemon could use some more training.
If Gloom beats Charmander, what Pokemon can I use next?
Squirtle, Pidgeotto and Pikachu couldn't take that terrible smell.
Chu!
-Pikachu? -Pika.
You're saying you want to battle?
Pikachu.
You know you're probably going to lose,
but you're still willing to battle Gloom to help me out?
-Pika, pika! -What? You say you're sure you'll win?
-Pikachu! Pika-pi. -Oh, Pikachu.
Heartwarming, but what's that smell?
What?
Your Pokemon skills are stinking up this Gym even worse than Gloom.
It's Team Rocket!
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above...
And last, but not least, to blast this dump sky-high!
-Jessie! -James!
Where did you put that blast ball?
Near us so I wouldn't lose it. Ah!
At least we get this lovely parting gift, their secret perfume formula.
What?
Team Rocket's blasting off again!
Quick, girls, we've got to rescue all the Pokemon fast!
Quick, now! Get into the Poke Ball and I'll carry you to safety.
Hurry! Now!
-Hurry. - There's some over here!
- There's a Pokemon! - We've got to get them all.
- Keep looking. Look everywhere. - Call the fire department!
They're on their way.
Pika, pika.
Cha.
I should never have listened to Team Rocket.
-Don't just stand around, Ash! -Huh?
Help us to put out the fire before this whole Gym is burnt to the ground.
Yeah, all right. Squirtle, water gun!
Staryu, Starmie, help us out now!
Squirtle!
Geodude! Throw as much dirt as you can on the flames!
Dude.
Geodude, Geodude, Geodude.
-Keep on spraying! -We've almost got it!
Erika, what's the matter?
I've looked and looked, but I can't find Gloom anywhere.
-Did Gloom get out? -Huh?
What if Gloom...? What if Gloom's still inside?
-Ah! - You can't go in there, Erika!
But Gloom may be trapped inside.
-I'll go in and find Gloom! -Don't, Ash!
Gloom?
Gloom!
Huh? Ah!
Gloom, Gloom!
Don't worry, Gloom. I promise I'll get you out of here!
Argh!
I can't get closer to that smell.
Gloom!
It's okay, Gloom. It's going to be okay.
It's too much! I can't hold my breath any longer.
Huh? There's no smell.
As long as Gloom doesn't feel threatened, it smells just fine.
Just make sure Gloom feels safe and show you want to be its friend.
Hm.
Come on. Let's go, Gloom.
Gloom, Gloom!
-Pikachu. -
All right, hey!
-Ash! - That was great!
Thank you, Ash.
With deep gratitude, I present you with this rainbow badge.
-What's that for? -I think you earned it.
-Don't you, Gloom? -Gloom, Gloom.
Thanks a lot.
Take a look, Pikachu. A rainbow badge.
-Pi, Pikachu! -Gloom, Gloom.
-Congratulations, Ash. -Thanks.
Uh, but what about Team Rocket?
They got away with your secret perfume formula.
No, they didn't.
essence of Gloom.
-Hm? -
It stinks!
Just like your plan.
You said it!
And so, in the race for a rainbow badge, it's Ash by a nose.
But most valuable of all, Ash has learned an important lesson,
you can't judge a Pokemon by its smell.
Okay, guys, we gotta rap some Pokemon.
You just do the singing I'll take care of the hard part.
