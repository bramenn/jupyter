eye catch
You're the one who gives me my future
Even on a road without signs, I'll be fine, if we're together
On a journey that I can't see ahead of, while I was lost, I found it
That my place to be is next to you
When we quarrelled, I let go of your hand again and again
I want to pull close and hold it now
You're the one who gives me my future
If I'm beaten down by the rain of tears
I wanna hold you, call my name immediately
I'll go embrace you
I'll accept sadness and bluffing in my hands
Boy
I suddenly turned my back on you and ran away
Because you've been so gentle to many other girls
Boy, please chase after me
Because it won't be over after this
I can't say I'm sorry, sorry
Even though I believe you, my lips are pouting
I can't be cute, sorry
Catch me in the town where a drizzle is falling
Because I'll turn around and give you a make-up kiss
In your warm arms
Seductive Beach
Seductive Beach
These are...
They were found in an aristocrat's manor.
Are they perhaps from your world?
They are.
But I've never seen so many of them in one place at once.
It's amazing.
I knew it.
Now, as for their use...
Judging by their shape...
Nononononono.
Yes, they may look like that, but they are...
In the water?! With these?!
So hot...
This summer's hotter than usual...
Hey, did you hear about the summer vacation?
What vacation?
Group trip.
They cancelled the trip to the Great Cathedral in Romalia, and we're going to the ocean instead.
The ocean?
I've always wanted to see it.
Tiffa, you've never seen the ocean?
No, since I've always lived in the forest.
The ocean's really nice.
Especially the beach at night! It's so mysterious and romantic.
Montmorency.
Would you like to walk the beach with me at night to gaze at the stars?
Not with the Order of Perverts.
Why don't you forgive him already?
He'll only get full of himself if I forgive him now.
Couldn't agree more.
Hey, come on.
The vacation's the perfect opportunity to fix relationships.
Just do this!
Gosh! What are you doing, Kirche?!
I'd... I'd never let him go further.
But... a night time stroll along the beach, huh?
So, Tiffa, what do you think of the ocean?
The ocean...
It's so blue... and big.
And salty, too.
It is.
You've got to go to a beach during the summer.
Siesta?! Why are you here, too?
You're even wearing a swimsuit.
I was told to take care of Saito-san.
Saito-san!
He's right. Those are not swimsuits.
Those? What do you mean?
A real swimsuit should be more like this...
And like this down here.
And this!
And this has to be more like this!
A real swimsuit?
What?!
Before we enter the ocean, the Queen has a word to say.
The Queen does?
Everyone, thanks to Principal Osmond,
I am here to join the Tristain Magic Academy's annual summer vacation.
I would like to get along with everyone here without consideration of status...
Now, to start things off,
all girls, change into what's in there.
What's this?!
That's what a real swimsuit looks like.
What? That's not underwear?
In this area, one must give prayer to the Spirit of Water before entering.
As it is a tradition, there are special uniforms for the priestesses.
I've never heard of such a thing.
Is there a Spirit of Water in the ocean, too?
Anyway, we can't get in the ocean unless you change into those!
The belly is totally exposed!
I can't wear something indecent like this.
If you were to wear one, Your Highness,
then the students shall surely follow suit.
I insist.
Very well.
When in Romalia, do as Romalians do.
If it is to give prayer to the Spirit of Water, I will gladly change into it.
If the Princess is going to wear one...
She'll be wearing one?
We'll now begin the purification ritual for the Spirit of Water.
First splash each other with water to cleanse one another.
Like this!
I'm all wet.
But that felt good.
Everyone, start splashing each other!
Siesta!
Ignoring status, right?
Stop being so cheeky! Stop!
I've never been happier to be alive than today.
This brings back memories.
Saito. You come from a wonderful country.
There are more extreme ones than those, too.
Even more?!
Then lets have them wear those.
Of course.
They'll call us the Order of Perverts, again.
So you don't want to see it, Reinard?
This is an important ritual to offer prayer to the Spirit of Water.
Let us burn the sights of beautiful, innocent,
pure girls offering their prayers to the Spirit onto our eyes together!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah...
We're changing again?
It's for the sake of the Spirit of Water.
Siesta... Aren't you getting full of yourself recently?
This keeps falling off.
This time, it's an offering ritual.
So close!
Amazing!
This view is glorious.
Is it over here?
No! Stop! It's me!
A bit more to the right, Tiffa!
Right?
Right there!
So close!
What was that?
I can only imagine a lecherous intent.
Agreed.
Hey. Why did you make Tiffa wear that of all things?
Louise...
W-What?
Well, ah... I thought you looked good in that swimsuit.
W-What are you saying all of a sudden?
Y-You know, Saito.
I-If it's okay...
W-Would you want to go out for a stroll tonight?
Y-Yeah...
Really?
That's great.
So I'll catch you later.
What? Louise, what did you just say?
Oh, well.
The next ritual makes use of a ball.
Now, everyone.
The team that wins this ritual will don the true priestess' garments,
allowed only to the chosen maidens.
It's all for the Spirit of Water's prayer, so take it seriously.
The chosen maidens...
We've got to see Tiffa in it.
We'll set things up so that she wins.
I don't see the whole picture,
but if I can see Tiffa in an amazing swimsuit, then I'm your man.
If I'm chosen as a true maiden, then I'm sure Saito would...
I guess this is a match, Miss Valliere.
The first match is Team Queen and Agnes vs. Team Tiffania and Siesta!
Here goes!
There!
Your Highness!
Okay!
That was amazing, Your Highness!
Out!
What did you say?!
Are your eyes knotholes?
How was that out?
That was definitely in!
No, it was out.
The word of the referees is final.
There!
Take this!
They'll crash!
Out.
Stop that nonsense!
That was definitely in!
What's going on?
10-7! Team Tiffania and Siesta wins!
We lost due to your crappy judgement!
Calm down.
Next up, Team Louise and Montmorency vs. Team Kirche and Tabitha!
Ready?
Yay!
Out.
You guys are doing it again!
I can't get enough of that!
I want to be the swimsuit!
10-9. Team Louise and Montmorency wins.
Yay!
Yay!
We wanted to see...
I wish you would understand the mood more.
What does that mean?
Is there a problem if we win?
N-No, nothing like that.
S-Saito. L-Let's go for the walk, shall we?
What? I'm kind of busy right now, so later, okay?
What was that?!
I even asked him, too!
I'll never let him pick up where we left off last time!
Everything's going as planned.
Though it was a shame that Kirche's team lost.
It'll finally be time for this tomorrow.
Y-You mean that that's...
Yes. Hard to believe, right?
I never imagined this would be a swimsuit, either.
Even I've only seen this one in magazines.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
What is it?
Let's go take a look.
I knew something was strange.
This is beyond perversion.
They're sickos!
Just you watch.
You'll get what you deserve.
They're late! What are they doing?
I'll go check.
Montmorency. What took you so long?
Where's everyone else?
Well...
My leg's cramped up from using it too much yesterday.
My sunburn hurts.
My shoulder's stiff from wearing something I'm not used to.
And I'm busy healing everyone with my Water magic.
I can't take part in the ritual.
S-So all four finalists are taking a break?
Is there a problem?
No, um...
Oh, and a message from Louise.
From Louise?
I actually wanted to be alone with you.
So come to the rocky stretch alone.
Make sure no one sees you.
To set up alone time by lying means...
I guess people in this world become more open at the beach.
Louise!
W-What the?!
Sorry to scare you, Darling.
I'll apologize beforehand.
Sorry, Saito-san.
Sorry? About what?
Miss Zerbst. What is it that you want,
calling me out to a place like this?
I can make a guess, but we are teacher and student.
Is that all right?
Yes, of course, Principal Osmond.
Does this suit your tastes?
This is the place, right?
But still, I can't believe that Tiffa gave me a letter.
Who knew Tiffa loved me?
Tiffa!
Not in your lifetime!
What are you doing to me?!
How dare you guys trick us?!
W-What are you guys talking about?!
Don't play dumb with us.
Looks like we've been found out.
W-What are you doing?!
How is it? Do you feel like giving prayers to the Spirit of Water?
Although this is a vacation, you guys went too far.
You all look nice.
Especially you, Malicorn.
I do?
Yes, since you have more breasts than someone.
Hey -
Who are you talking about?
We're sorry! We really are!
We swear we won't do it again, so forgive us!
Please! Louise!
Let's go, everyone.
Wait, Louise!
Princess!
I left my wand at the inn, so there's nothing we can do.
Rather than that, everyone, look at our feet.
Isn't the tide rising?
Yes, that's it.
You're getting better at it, Tiffa.
Really?
What's the matter, Miss Valliere?
I think I bumped into something.
That tickles!
What are you doing to me, Siesta?!
It's not me.
So who is it?
W-What is that?
That is the Spirit of Water that appears once every thirty years.
The legendary giant octopus!
It is blinded with rage since you all neglected the ritual!
Just a joke. A joke.
Tiffa! Montmorency!
You idiot! Don't do it, Louise!
Damn it...
You! Let go of those two!
Louise!
Your Highness, it's dangerous!
Please wait!
No!
Your Highness!
No, not there!
What an envi... I mean, horrible thing!
Need is ha nowsis.
Tabitha's the only one with her wand!
Can't you cast something stronger?
No. Anything stronger would hurt the others.
I got it off!
Hang on, Louise!
Saito! Untie us, too!
Partner, look at the water!
You can run along its leg.
All right.
Stop it!
Don't worry! I'll save you right now!
Hurry and get away.
Yes.
Got you.
Louise, are you hurt?
Saito...
Thank goodness you're all right.
Come save me sooner.
You're such a useless familiar.
Where I come from, this is how you eat octopus.
I bet you'll all love this.
Hey, Louise.
What? Hey.
We can't let those lechers see...
But Tiffa's by far the best one in these.
P-Please don't stare at me so much.
Isn't that one too big for Miss Valliere?
What did you say?!
Too loose.
I'm satisfied.
I didn't expect to get to see them in the true maiden garment.
I don't mind dying right now.
Hey, help me...
Did anyone else just hear something?
I think it's your imagination.
Hey, Louise. The octopus balls are ready.
Sigh...
It's impossible.
But...
