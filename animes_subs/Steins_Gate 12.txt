SCRIPT
This is Earth, seventy million years ago.
Mayuri?
You were sent here by a time machine.
Is that you, Mayuri?
Mayushii has looked for Okarin
in many, many, many world lines, chasing him.
Mayuri?
You could say that the Okarin here
is one of many Okarins. And you could say that
he's the original Okarin.
And you could also say the Mayushii here
is one of many Mayushiis. And you could say that
she's the original, too.
And so,
I think Okarin and Mayushii are gonna die here.
But I believe
that our wills will carry on
to the Okarin and Mayushii, in Akihabara, seventy million years from now.
So...
It's okay.

Okarin!
Kurisu-chan says to come in, because she's almost done.
And Mayushii's cosplay...
Well...
Come on! Come on!
OP
suujuuoku mono kodou no kazu sae
Even the world's billions of heartbeats
anata ni wa matataki teido no saji na toukyuu
Are nothing to you but a fleeting and insignificant question
kako ni torawarete mirai wo nageku mo
We may be trapped in the past or lament the future
chiri hitotsu gosan wo yurusanu hitsuzen
But predetermination does not allow the slightest mistake
mugen ni hirogaru yume mo egaku mirai mo
The infinite dreams and imagined futures before us
bokutachi ni yurusareta kyoei no genri
Are naught but vain theories we may hold
yuugen sore wa futatsu no hari ga shimesu
Finitude is what the two clock hands show
zankoku na yakujou to sentaku e
As they point toward a cruel destiny and choice
Hacking to the Gate
dakara ima ichibyou goto ni sekaisen wo koete
And now I cross the boundary between worlds each second
kimi no sono egao mamoritai no sa
Because I want to protect that smile of yours
soshite mata kanashimi no nai jikan no ruupu e to
And a loop in time without sadness will once again
nomikomarete yuku kodoku no kansokusha
Engulf me, a lonely observer
Do you think you could hold this?
Like this?
That's right. Keep it spread out like that!
That ribbon's cute.
Right?
Want to try it on?
I still have some cosplay outfits for Comima.
Cosplay, huh?
Interested?
N-No way!
I couldn't wear this around others...
It's done!
I win!
We were racing.
I lose.
But we're done, too.
Now we're done.
This is...
a time leap machine.
It looks like an evil organization's brainwashing machine.
It's like Phone Microwave-chan, now with headphones!
It may not look like much,
but theoretically, this can transmit memories into the past.
Especially now that we can use the LHC.
The LHC's involved?
Yes, it's basically a problem of compression.
Me on 2010/8/13 AD
Hippocampus
Scan Memory Data (3.24T)
Nerve Pulse Signals Encode to Electric Signals
Like I said,
this machine reads the signals
comprising memories in the brain, encoding them as data.
Scan Memory Data (3.24T)
Nerve Pulse Signals Encode to Electric Signals
In total, it's 3.24 terabytes.
Scan Memory Data (3.24T)
Nerve Pulse Signals Encode to Electric Signals
Time Leap Machine
But the Phone Microwave
can only send a little over 36 bytes.
Generate a black hole with the LHC
Use the black hole with the data
Of course, data at the terabyte level is out of the question.
3.24 T 36 byte
Generate a black hole with the LHC
Use the black hole with the data
3.24 T 36 byte
Compress!
So we send it to the LHC,
Generate a black hole with the LHC
Use the black hole with the data
Compress!
3.24 T 36 byte
Generate a black hole with the LHC
Use the black hole with the data
Compress!
3.24 T 36 byte
use the black hole to compress it,
and then send it back,
Time Leap Machine

Like putting a futon that won't fit in a closet inside a compression bag?
Strictly speaking, it's different.
But that's close enough for you to get an idea.
Just as with the D-mail, we can send data to the past.
Then we use the cell phone's spread spectrum waves to copy
the future memories to the brain in the past.
This creates a you with memories from the future.
The furthest back you can send data is forty-eight hours at a time.
Any further, and the two brain states'
difference is too large,
and it might fail.
And there's one other problem.
What?
Unlike the Phone Microwave or the D-mail,
we need an experiment subject,
or we can't do it.
Since we're sending memories,
the only way to know if it succeeded
is to use a human.
In other words, one of us has to do it?
I'll pass.
Okabe, tell me what you think.
Not Hououin... Okabe.
Daru?
'Sup?
We still don't know why the line connected to SERN, right?
Yeah...
But there's nothing to indicate the hacking has been discovered.
I agree.
If they'd really noticed, they would have done something.
Can we really overcome time?
Part of me wants to find out.
Th-Then...
Can't Mayushii buy some bananas,
so we can time leap the bananas that Mayushii bought
Mayuri, I explained, right?
Bananas have no memories.
But we won't do the experiment.
We'll announce this to the world.
We'll give the time leap machine to an appropriate organization.
I agree...
If you're okay with that.
Mayushii really agrees!
Hashida ordered pizza, right?
Yeah.
Then I'll just make the salad.
And we'll need...
Wait.
What?
You said salad, right?
Yes, grapefruit salad.
Then why do we have natto and ground beef in the cart?
You can make some good stuff by combining things.
The grapefruit is sour, so you can
combine anything with it.
No, you can't!
You can!
You'll see, once you try.
If you want salad,
there's a complete salad right here!
And it's 50 off!
It's no fun buying something that's already made.
This is why guys
only interested in experiments are no good...
Ah, here's the coriander.
It's me.
The Organization's agent has finally made her move.
Send help!
Now!
You look like a cat just out of the hospital.
Your face says, I'm free at last!
I'm surprised.
I expected you to say we were starting
the time leap experiment immediately.
Dissatisfied?
I guess so.
On a fundamental level, humans are temporal creatures.
Heidegger said that.
Honestly, I was relieved when you said we wouldn't do the experiment.
I think everyone else agrees.
Hey, if we're having a party,
can I call Ruka-chan and Feyris-chan?
It's a development conference.
Mayuri might have been thinking
we should stop, for a long time now.
That's true.
Actually, she may have seen more than the two of us,
since we've been obsessed with the experiments.
When do we announce it?
The sooner the better, I think.
Tell me ahead of time.
I want to contact my mom.
And...
My dad will also find out
that I made a time leap machine.
Maybe we won't be able to go to Aomori.
This is going to be big.
Don't worry.
I'll solve my lab members' problems.
Right, right.
You just want to abuse me as your assistant, right?
Because you're my dear companion.
Th-Thanks...
Ow...
What are you doing?
I thought you might have a fever
because you're saying un-assistant-like things!
I-I'm not...
I'm not grateful to you.
I'm just being polite...
What kind of tsundere is that?
I'm not a tsundere!
And what about you?
You always, always say the craziest stuff,
and now you're talking about companions?
You're all over the place!
Don't be stupid!
I never waver.
My lab members are my allies,
and the world my enemy!
That's all.
I'm so stunned, I can't speak.
You just spoke!
Don't try to trip me up!
Snacking while everyone's out?
That's bad manners.
Pizza doesn't taste good cold.
Anyway, why are all three of them the same?
My personal taste.
Why, you...
You think you can be so dictatorial?!
See?
I was right to buy the ingredients, wasn't I?
Wait a second. I'll get started.
Why didn't you stop her?
I did! With all my might! With all I had!
Okarin, you said you'd protect your lab members, right?
Don't give up.
It might not be over yet.
It's still possible
the apple pie was just a failed attempt,
and normally...
I forgot radishes...
I guess sweet pickles will work.
When this meal is over, I'm going to retire and get married.
I'm back!
Mayuri, I'm so glad.
Get to the kitchen!
Yo!
What? I smell something good.
The pizza's here already?
I'll get my kara-age...
Why is Makise Kurisu here?
Because I'm a lab member.
What are you doing here?
I'm a lab member.
What's going on?
No idea.
Kurisu-chan, did something happen between you and Suzu-san?
Nothing.
She just keeps blaming me for the craziest stuff.
She said I'm a SERN spy.
I'm not crazy. It's the truth.
How can you be so certain?
Do you have any proof?
I don't have any proof.
But it will happen.
Huh?
It's a prophecy.
I know more about you than you do.
Who you really are,
and what you're going to do after this.
I'm sorry.
That makes so little sense,
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Kurisu-chan...
Suzu-san!
Get back, Mayuri...
Only Hououin Kyouma can handle this situation.
Assistant!
I raised you better than that!
You didn't raise me.
I'll tell you what the most important thing is about being a mad scientist...
I'm not listening, and I won't be a mad scientist.
Part-time soldier!
I warned Okabe Rintaro, didn't I?
Beware of Makise Kurisu.
Yes, you did say that...
You did, huh?
So you believed her, did you?
I did not...
But you didn't tell me I was wrong.
Um...
Aren't you making things worse?
Shut up!
Why don't you try?
You know
Um...
Mayushii doesn't like fighting...
Mayuri.
I-I don't really like it, either.
When we're all together...
I think it'd be more fun if we were friends!
Consider well.
Is that card a link?
Or a virus?
Part-time soldier, your fate as a soldier,
and the last slice of cake, rests on this.
When in doubt, attack!
That's my motto!
You fell for it, girl.
Now you have three viruses.
Tell me you give up,
and I'll give you the cherry on top.
Miss Amane is taking this too seriously.
Okarin, you're being mean to Suzu-san.
In the world of games, it's live or die.
That's how I was raised.
The ones lined up in the corner
are definitely link cards.
Knowing Okabe's personality, I'm sure of it.
Take one.
She's right!
Assistant!
You're my assistant, yet you betray me?
Stop calling me assistant!
I hate that arrogance of yours!
Mayushii will help, too.
Then would you get tea for everyone, Mayuri?
Sure!
Now then...
Thank you, Kurisu-chan.
For what?
Mayushii is happy you made friends with Suzu-san.
We're not really friends.
But I think you're right.
When we're all together, it's more fun to get along.
I was talking with Okabe...
You may be the one
with the clearest view of the lab.
That was the only time Okabe's looked serious.
It was kind of creepy.
That's mean to Okarin!
I'm sorry.
But...
Curse you, part-time warrior!
You won, but not of your own ability!
Don't be so arrogant!
This is really good!
I'm off to plan for round two.
Enjoy it while you can...
The last dessert of your life!
Wanna go check on him?
I'll take care of this.
Okay.
Okarin!
What?
I couldn't find a flashlight.
The Cyalume Saber is Future Gadget 6.
Don't use it as a flashlight.
But it's bright...
You seem to be having fun.
I am!
The pizza was good,
and Suzu-san and Kurisu-chan were having fun.
I'm not!
Hey, we've got lots of lab members now, right?
So I was thinking that lately, we've been lacking a bunch of stuff.
A bunch of stuff?
Um, chairs?
And we need more utensils...
Wait just a bit more.
If we announce we've made a time leap machine,
we'll get some kind of reward.
That will solve everything.
Really?
We can buy chairs and utensils?
Yup.
What if I said we could buy those and still have money left over?
Then a microwave, too!
I miss being able to heat up my kara-age.
I'll consider it.
It's kind of strange.
You looked really lonely in the spring.
The lab was always quiet.
All I could hear was the sound of your computer.
And now there's Daru-kun and Kurisu-chan,
and Ruka-chan, Suzu-san, Moeka-san,
Feyris-chan, and Mr. Braun and Nae-chan...
Mayuri?
It's okay now, isn't it?
Even if Mayushii isn't your hostage anymore.
Okarin! Mayushii!
Big trouble!
The trains stopped!
Bomb threat? Akihabara in panic.
For those of you just tuning in,
the following lines have been shut down, due to a bomb threat.
Yamanote Line.
Soubu Line.
A bomb threat, huh?
What a pain.
I need to call home.
This party was to celebrate the time leap machine's completion, right?
That's right.
Why mention that now?
Are you still hacking into SERN?
I guess you could say that. I got in deeper.
What do you mean?!
I got a direct connection to SERN.
Everyone! You need to...
I'm sorry.
I'm leaving!
Suzu-san!
What was that about?
What will you do, Mayushii?
Take a taxi home?
Hmm... Don't have the money for a taxi.
Huh?
My watch isn't working...
That's strange.
I just wound it.
What is this?
Wh-What?
Don't move.
All of you, put your hands up.
Moeka-san...
Kiryuu Moeka...
SERN will take the time machine.
SERN?
What do you mean?
Makise Kurisu.
Okabe Rintaro.
Hashida Itaru.
You three are coming with me.
What about Mayuri?
Shiina Mayuri is...
Don't.
Don't do it.
For FB... FB... FB...
Mayuri?
Mayuri!
Mayuri?
What is this?
What the hell is this?!
