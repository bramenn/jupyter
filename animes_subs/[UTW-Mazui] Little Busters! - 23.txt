Kud went back to Tebwa.
Since then, watching the news has become part of our daily routine.
The TV kept us up to date with the situation in Tebwa each day.
Tebwa Rocket Accident
The conflagration at the Novyi Baikonur launch site
has yet to be extinguished.
Because the Tebwan government was unable to respond to the incident with due haste,
rebel forces in the region who opposed the rocket launch have begun an armed uprising.
What?!
An uprising?!
What the hell is happening to Tebwa?!
What does that mean?
What do they mean, rebel forces?
There is a great deal of tension between the Tebwan natives who have lived there for hundreds of years
and the westerners who moved there post-19th century.
The failed launch likely transformed that tension into an uprising.
The rebel forces have attacked officials and persons related to TASA, which they blame for the accident.
The violence has resulted in several casualties.
Casualties?!
No way...
Kud-o isn't one of them, right?
There was just too much of a rift between the peaceful everyday life we were living
and the grim situation in that faraway land.
But Kud was, without a doubt, in the midst of that chaos.
Why is this happening?
The sea and sky are as beautiful as always,
but this is Tebwa now.
Hurry.
It's dangerous here.
Let me take you to where your grandfather is hiding.
Grandpa!
Kunya!
I was worried sick thinking you were somewhere here in Tebwa!
Those rebels are killing people indiscriminately.
You came back to Tebwa too, Grandpa?
I came to see Chernushka ride that rocket into space.
Mom...
There's still hope.
There's word that the astronauts aboard noticed an anomaly prior to the accident and got off.
Then...
Chernushka may still be alive.
What is it?
We bring news.
By the heavens, it's a miracle!
Kunya, they've just confirmed that Chernushka's alive!
She was injured while saving one of the other astronauts, but it isn't life-threatening!
Thank goodness... Thank goodness!
She heard you were here, and she's headed this way now.
She may be injured, but she wants to come no matter what!
I'm going to see her here.
Do you want to come too?
Wait here.
The island is crawling with rebels.
Don't move an inch from this house.
I'll be back soon.
With your mother.
You want to be an astronaut...
I've never been happier in my life!
Kudryavka.
I'm so glad I gave you that name.
Mom... despises me.
I know it!
I ran away without telling her!
I can't look at Mom's face.
No...
No!
I came here because I didn't want to run away again!
It's her. That woman's daughter.
The traitor who wasted the nation's resources
and ran off to Japan.
Was I...
wrong?
I should have told Kud not to go to somewhere so dangerous.
There's no use regretting now.
All we can do is pray she comes back safely.
It's a part from the rocket Kud's mom was on.
It must be important to her.
Maybe she should have taken it with her as a charm.
Riki...
Hold onto it for her.
There's no point in worrying!
Kud-o promised she'd come back!
Yeah!
Riki wished her good luck with that spell!
Spell?
Ni puha ni pera?
What does it mean?
Ni puha ni pera.
No fluff, no feathers.
Huh?
May you go to hell with your feathers torn from you.
No way!
Kud made me wish her that?!
Why would she...
If you wish for everything, your wish won't come true.
So if you want to wish someone happiness, you wish for the opposite.
It's a Russian tradition.
Kudryavka went back to Tebwa prepared for the worst.
Noumi-san will come back.
I loved Noumi-san's smile when she played baseball.
Just watching her made me happy.
Noumi-san became a natural part of the world through the Little Busters.
Without even one of us, that place...
that world would not exist.
Noumi-san will return safe and sound.
I have faith.
At least leave my mother's hat with me.
By this time, I bet your dear mommy's...
I'm so weak.
I ended up here because I ran away again.
I'm useless to the world.
A failure of a gear.
Kudryavka, always alone.
Rin?
I can't sleep.
Kud left her best friends in my care.
Strelka and Belka?
Yeah.
I don't know how to say it, but...
It's the first time anyone's left something so important to me.
Kud's coming back, right?
You'll just experience the same thing, the same time?
No...
Kudryavka, don't give up!
You can't!
I haven't been of any use to anyone!
If I can't do something for anyone...
If I can't do something for Riki and Rin-san...
I promised I'd go home.
I want to play baseball again.
I want to laugh with everyone again.
In that place that I love.
And...
And one day...
I want to go with my mom...
To space.
Through those 50 nautical miles of sky!
I need to get out of here.
Out of this dark place!
I won't run from my fears again!
Suppose the world were a giant clock.
It would be made of an infinite number of nameless gears.
But no matter how small a gear is...
We would be ourselves,
and Kud would be herself.
By talking, touching, and thinking of each other,
we can move on.
We can change the world through a compounding of little things.
Yes.
Kud is an important gear to us.
Without Kud, we can't move!
So...
Hang in there, Kud!
Hang in there.
We're waiting for you...
Noumi...
We're waiting for you.
Hang in there!
Kuu-chan...
Come back.
Kudryavka.
Come back safe and sound...
Kud!
Everyone's voices?
Even if it's just an illusion, I'm glad...
I won't...
Kud!
Hang in there!
How...
I'm a very lucky person.
I was able to meet people I love.
Thank you, Riki.
You don't have to be like your mom.
You can be awkward and clumsy.
You just need to find what you can do.
You can be your own gear and chase your dream of space.
Your mom showed you that dream, and you looked up to her.
Somewhere, a clock began to move.
You can hear its long hand moving.
Forward...
To the future!
Almost like 50 nautical miles of sky...
Akruks, Bekruks, Gakruks, Dekruks...
The Southern Cross!

Blooming on the side of the road, the red flower's petals

Each drop makes my heart flow over
It appears that the rebel uprising has lost its momentum,

Wow, Rin-chan!
kanashikute sora aoidemita nara
When I felt sad, I looked up at the sky,
Hey, now.
anata no ano kotoba
I remembered your words
A peaceful everyday life hides its fragility.
Fear and violence aren't just something in another world, completely unrelated to us.
If a disaster happens, we can't change it.
yorimichi wo shite takai kousha no okujou
Taking a little detour, I climbed to the roof of the school
But as long as we small gears are linked together,
we can keep moving forward, even if it's only one small step.

That's what I thought.

to my mom!

Each time a raindrop falls from the sky
Last night, before I left Tebwa, I talked to my mom!

But it's so quiet here
But I don't want to force that dream onto you.

When I realized that I would never reach it,
You should live your own dream, Kunya.

I remembered your words
Your own life.
With a smile.
Become your own gear for what you hold dearest.

That's right.

The tears we shed rise to the sky and
Don't forget.

The west wind blows, the clouds drift past,
What about me?

What?! Alone?!

Kuu-chan!
Kud!
Kud-o!

The gray clouds break and between them

A gold curtain falls on through
I'm back!

Following a rainbow that spans the sky
Right?

Will be returned once again to the sky
