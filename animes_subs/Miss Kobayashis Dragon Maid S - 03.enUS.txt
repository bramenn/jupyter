Kanna-san, I'm here to play!
Oh!
Saikawa's here!
Saikawa Riko
Hello, Saikawa.
Yes, I'm glad to be here!
Huh?
Where's your mother?
Shopping with Lady Tohru.
Meaning...
it's just the two of us?!
Oh, my, what do I do?
I'm going to climb the stairs to adulthood.
Saikawa?
Is this my own Cinderella story?!
K-Kanna-san, may I borrow your bathroom?
Down and to the right.
I'm so nervous.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Who is that woman?!
Ilulu. A friend.
So it isn't just the two of us.
How long have you known each other?
I've known her since a while back.
But she only came here recently,
and now she's living here.
She's living here?!
Now that I think about it,
there are a lot of mysteries surrounding Kanna-san.
She calls her mother by her last name, Kobayashi,
and she addresses the maid as Lady.
Sometimes I think she's spacing out,
but then she's oddly smart and athletic.
Saikawa, let's play already.
Whatever! She's still cute!
Oh, I brought cards with me.
Mm!
Ilulu-san, would...
you like to join us?
Join us!
I'm fine.
Did I say anything to upset her?
Ah, I lost.
Saikawa, you let it show on your face too much.
Penalty game.
Rub my tummy.
Wouldn't this actually be a reward?
Hey, I happened to be in the area.
I brought snacks.
Kobayashi and Tohru aren't home.
Oh, my. I suppose I'll wait for them, then.
You can split the snacks with Miss Saikawa.
Yay!
Hey.
You're not going to play with those two?
I have no right to.
I tried to destroy this city.
I haven't forgiven myself yet.
Would you like to turn back time, then, and make it so that never happened?
I could do that much for you.
It's fine.
That wouldn't be right.
I can't erase what Kobayashi said to me.
I see.
But no right to, huh?
If you're going to look it at like that,
there aren't many Dragons who do have a right to interact with humans.
Mm.
It's not working like it did with Miss Kobayashi.
Well, I'll go try talking to them for a bit.
You can go ahead and wait in the bathroom.
I mean, to be honest, I want to play.
I won't lie about those feelings anymore,
but what I did is a different story.
I want to avoid asking Kobayashi about it, too,
because she'd probably resolve it easily.
Ah, I lost again.
Saikawa,
are you losing on purpose?
Not at all!
But I'm bored with playing cards by ourselves now.
Yeah, it is just the two of us.
Need to pee beam!
Kanna-san, I'm going to the bathroom.
Again?
Why do I need to go the bathroom so much today?
Huh?!
I-I'm sorry!
Huh?!
What? Why?!
Huh? Uhh...
Hey, what's your name?
Huh? Saikawa.
Saikawa.
I actually wanted to play with you earlier.
Huh?
But I was a violent person,
so I didn't think it was okay.
Violent person?
I tried to break all sorts of things.
Oh, a delinquent.
You don't like violent people, right?
Well, I'm a violent person myself.
Really?
Yeah.
I often act out when I don't like something.
Huh?!
At first I didn't like Kanna-san either,
so I thought about striking her down.
S-She's...
But she's cute, so I decided I wanted to be friends.
She's...
You're cute, too, Ilulu-san,
so want to be friends?
She's not thinking at all!
Children are still in the middle of learning how to properly handle
responsibility and the weight of their sins.
But Ilulu's environment never allowed her that opportunity.
She had to change or she'd be deceived.
She had to change or she wouldn't be able to fight alongside adults.
But for now she can forget all that and go back.
Because there's an adult who will kindly trick her here.
She should go back to being an irresponsible kid who doesn't know right from wrong.
We're home.
Lucoa-san's here?
Sorry, we ran into Elma.
Shh.
Hmm?
Should I wake them?
No, go grab a blanket.
I should call Saikawa-san's parents.
Episode 3
Extracurricular Activities (Of Course They're Not Normal)
Miss Kobayashi's watching me.
She's staring right at me.
I can feel the passion behind her gaze!
Ahh, if she keeps looking at me like she's licking me all over, I'll...
I'll!
A sigh?!
Not at you.
At that maid outfit.
This outfit?
Yeah.
I bought a similar outfit when I was in high school,
using the money from my first paycheck.
I wanted to show it off to my family.
Then...
Then?
They said I didn't look good in it.
Everyone disliked it and told me so.
Ever since then I've stuck to being an onlooker.
So, after having that exchange with her
I thought to myself,
Why don't we try making a maid outfit that would look good on Miss Kobayashi?
So, I was hoping I could borrow some wisdom from all of you.
You're always so frantic when it comes to Miss Kobayashi.
I'm grateful you could all come.
Wait!
I didn't call for you!
Mr. Takiya invited me.
Mr. Takiya!
I'd feel bad leaving her out.
You have a bad habit of hiding your embarrassment with fake anger and hostility.
N-No I don't!
Hey, I'm really sorry.
When I woke up Tohru had already gathered everyone.
That's cold of you, Kobayashi-san.
Georgie
We're comrades.
How could I ever hesitate to spare time for a comrade?
Georgie-san.
Yes, yes. Okay, we're starting!
For now, would you all please draw out your ideas?
Yes!
That's incredible, Kanna-san!
If you buy one more property, you'll have a monopoly on the area!
Monopoly?
You'll be the king of it!
You'll be able to do whatever you want with that area!
Oh!
Ah, there's such a big house in Kanna's area!
Sorry, but this a competition.
Demon!
You're heartless!
I don't really get it, but it's a game that brings out the worst in them, huh?
Here!
That was fast, Elma.
Miss Kobayashi is stoic and quick to finish her work at the company,
so I thought of this!
The fact that you're hooked on daifuku comes off too strongly.
Daifuku goes in here
Huh? That's no good?
But they're quick to eat and replenish your nutrients.
Please just go play with the children in the other room already.
It's my turn next.
Hmm, this is too cute, isn't it?
I don't think something like this would look good on me.
Ahh, I wasn't imagining you wearing it.
Do that.
Tch.
I'm done, too!
Too much skin!
That's what our local servants wore.
It's too ethnic!
Here.
Georgie-san.
My real hope. I wonder what she'll propose.
Kobayashi-san.
Oh, yes?
A long dress style,
with few adornments and an air of refinement despite the simplicity.
No daifuku
No daifuku
I believe that's your preferred type?
Yes, it is.
However, what is a maid outfit?
Huh?
It's true the designs have changed with different eras and customs,
and those designs continue to be polished every day as the maid outfit changes.
However, it is always a maid who wears one.
They are not a maid because they wear a maid outfit.
They become maid outfits because a maid wears that outfit.
Kobayashi-san.
I am also a student.
I cannot wear my maid outfit at any and all times.
However, no matter what I wear,
yes, even if I wear my school uniform,
so long as I remain a maid,
even that school uniform can become a maid outfit, wouldn't you agree?
Yes, that means a maid outfit
is worn around the heart!
It's the spirit of service!
Perfect
We're getting off track!
Tohru!
You don't need to come back.
We finished a round!
That aside, you've been making jabs at ours,
so what kind of outfit did you draw?
Oh, uh, well...
That's kind of suspicious.
Show us!
Oh, hey, stop, pervert!
Hmm? What? It's completely blank.
You couldn't think of anything?
No...
I was thinking I'd like Miss Kobayashi to wear my maid outfit.
Your outfit is too cute for me.
Right.
But, sure.
You did call everyone over for me.
I'll wear it.
Miss Kobayashi...
Okay, I put it on!
Oh!
You look good.
You're cute, Kobayashi-san.
Yes, yes, thank you for the flattery.
Let's take a photo!
It's you and me as double maids!
Let's get everyone together if we're taking one.
Huh?!
Okay, everyone, please line up.
I'm beside Kobayashi.
Ah, not fair!
Hey, I was first, you all!
Hey, Tohru.
Yes?
Today I realized something.
What's that?
Do you remember what Georgie-san said?
Yes.
They become maid outfits because a maid wears them.
That also means
that no matter what outfit they wear, it's not a maid outfit if it's not being worn by a maid.
It's just cosplay.
I was always rejecting your outfit, but after wearing it I had a change of heart,
embarrassing though it was.
It wasn't bad.
I thought, Oh, so this is what I wanted to wear, isn't it?
I thought cute outfits wouldn't look good on me, so I always wore men's clothing.
I was worried about whether or not I would look good in it.
But if I wanted to wear a maid outfit, then I should've just worn it without caring.
That's when I remembered something.
I wanted to cosplay.
But I couldn't make myself look cute,
so I turned to style and refinement and became an annoying maid otaku.
Miss Kobayashi.
But you know,
seeing you and having you serve as a maid
made me realize the outfit you wear is a proper maid outfit.
You're always so genuine when you take back things you've said.
I love that unfair side of you, Miss Kobayashi.
I never could have said this to you when you first came here, though.
Please continue helping with housework, Tohru.
You should call me maid there!
Hey, I'm out of money.
Ilulu, you waste too much.
It's all right.
You'll pass the bank soon, so you'll get more money then.
I will?!
But still, after that it's Shouta street.
No matter where I stop I'll have to pay expensive rental fees.
Go on, rest assured and roll the dice.
Demon!
Bankrupt
Ilulu's out.
Neighborhood Notice
Oborozuka Neighborhood Association
Tohru-chan, do you have any hobbies?
Hobbies? I'm a maid.
I have... plenty of free time.
What are your hobbies, Miss Sasakibe?
Lately I've been into making sweets.
Is that what that earlier piercing noise was?
Huh?! I'm sorry, was it that loud?!
Still, I can't think of anything.
In the past I was interested in travel.
Music, huh?
That's popular among humans.
Speaking of music, there's nihilistic Mr. Yana.
So, you came to ask me about it?
Please teach me what makes music fun.
Probably the way it heats up your soul and makes your heart go bomber.
Your heart go bomber?
Bomber!
I'll teach you a little bit, so give it a try.
Okay.
Hmm, I don't quite understand.
Huh?
What's the matter?
It hurts. Your talent hurts.
I made him depressed for some reason.
Oh, my, Sone-san.
I brought over another one I happened to make.
Oh, this one turned out well, too!
Do you have fun making things like this?
Want to try making one?
All done.
Hmm.
It's an incredibly elaborate design.
There aren't many who could make something this good.
But I don't quite understand what makes it fun.
I just tried playing music, too, but...
I happened to hear that,
but it felt like you were just playing the score with precise timing.
Oh, you could hear that?
It's probably because it was too easy for you,
so there wasn't any room to pour emotions into it.
Without curiosity and emotion you won't be satisfied by that hobby.
So, that's how it is?
I'm home.
Kanna, do you have any hobbies?
Hobbies?
Walking this white line.
What's fun about that?
I die if I fall.
I see. It's training for fighting in limited spaces.
I took Kanna's instincts as a dragon lightly!
Oh, it stops.
Like this! Like this!
I don't go that far.
But you can't call that a hobby.
It's fun when I do it with Saikawa.
Ah! Not fair, Kanna!
Give me some donuts, too!
No.
Tohru!
You laze about every day.
Those who don't work, don't eat.
Ilulu, do you have any hobbies?
Hobbies? Sleeping?
That's less a hobby and more your way of life.
You're mean.
So good.
Hmph.
What flavor?
Hobbies are hard.
Chocolate. Yours?
Cinnamon.
Idols are popular at school.
Idol worship?
But I'm not interested in that stuff.
No, wait.
I know!
I'd just need Miss Kobayashi to become an idol!
Good work.
Good work.
Yes, hello?
Kobayashi, Kobayashi!
Hurry home quick!
Lady Tohru's lost it!
Huh?!
What happened?!
Love kiss, lick kiss,
love kiss, lick kiss,
I love Miss Kobayashi!
Love kiss, lick kiss,
love kiss, lick kiss,
I love Miss Kobayashi!
Love lick kiss!
What is this?
Lady Tohru's been constantly producing Kobayashi goods and showing them off to us.
She's been singing to us, too.
Miss Kobayashi! Hobbies are fun!
Miss Kobayashi, Miss Kobayashi, Miss Kobayashi, Miss Kobayashi, together forever!
I'm not much better when I get wasted, so I can't put my foot down.
I've reached the target earnings.
Now I just need to reach the goal!
Saikawa, what do we do?
Huh?!
No way!
Goal.
That's my Kanna-san!
How?!
I transferred all my assets to Kanna-san!
Huh?! That's not fair!
Everything that's mine in Kanna-san's!
My heart, my body, everything!
Ahh, my king!
Worship me!

What's your hobby, Miss Lucoa?
Hmm, Shouta, I guess?
I figured.
And yours is games, Mr. Fafnir?
No.
It's games, right?
No.
Oh, come on.
I said it's not.
