Stronghold of Lust
<Where is Pleguzes Jiart?>
<You may begin.>
<Your Majesty!>
To see the oracle's prophecy fulfilled,
we have conducted multiple reconnaissance missions.
I believe it is now time to launch a massive strike.
I'd love to hear how you came to that conclusion!
I hope that this encompassing strike is not a waste of time, Dolgana.
Naturally, there is no point in making such
a maneuver if it fails to usher staggering results.
It would seem that some of the primitives are capable of flying like us.
You mean the ones who kicked your butt?
I-if I had more time, I could have turned them into a sea of blood!
That is enough!
Dolgana, let us hear your plan.
Your Majesty!
For starters, I would like Klein to fight in the vanguard.
Cool!
We will follow behind and hunt down the lamata!
Very well.
What would you have me do?
Babysit Lumes?
Lutiel, I would like you and Lumes to finish off the remaining lamata.
Dolgana, you will be in charge of this Ta Hevara.
Your Majesty!
May the gods be with you!
How does everyone find working together for the shikaara amusing?
I've heard that this journey's prophecy
is of a scale that comes only once every 300 years.
The lamata have resisted beyond our-
The thrill of the hunt comes from everyone relying upon their own skills!
At any rate, I'm going to put this to an end.
The impatient brat!
May I have a glass?
You're still here, Lutiel?
This wine is most delicious.
Shouldn't you see to your preparations?
I'll leave after one more glass.
I'm quite excited!
What will I get to mount in my manor after this Ta Hevara?
This prophecy is not meant for your personal gain.
Bear that in mind.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Take care of it.
Your Highness!
Pleguzes!
The parisada just adjourned a few minutes ago.
I am aware.
Then where were you?!
Jiart!
Brother...
You are hurt.
Tend to him.
I would have appreciated your attendance, Pleguzes.
That is enough.
But Your Majesty-!
You cannot measure him by
your set of standards, not my brother.
Brother, would you care for a match?
I must prepare for Ta Hevara.
Purify yourself and prepare for battle.
I can smell my brother on you...
Pleguzes?
Accept your fate!
Prince Jiart!
Move!
My!
Is it to your liking?
I like how it is more humble than you.
My brother's woman was also humble.
And she was not to your liking?
It made her boring.
Even I may not amply satisfy you, Prince Pleguzes.
You are the very image of a Manaava.
You obey your instincts as you obtain anything you desire.
Instinct...
But those lamata!
Supposedly they consider it a disgrace to obey
one's instinct and drown in desire.
But isn't there dignity in the instinct of the living?
Take what you want.
Kill those you wish to kill.
And rape those you wish to rape,
yes, Pleguzes Jiart?
Do you think that race of lamata can defy our instincts?
So? Why exactly are we implementing this kind of operation?
As I already explained,
we were successfully able to shrink the light wave weapon.
However, it takes time to fire.
Furthermore, it is unable to fire a chain of shots.
As such, we must rely on tactics that-
Got it, got it.
S-sir, I wasn't done yet!
I can figure out the rest from there.
Now, more importantly!
Could anything use some sprucing up?
Sir?
How do I look?
Commander in Chief Zorig of the GDF
will explain the situation leading to the present.
Our GDF army was originally formed as a space security force.
The economic powers of the world established their own armies.
And those armies were unified as one, becoming the GDF.
Afterwards, the Wulgaru hit us with a surprise attack.
As it was our first encounter with foes from outer space,
it was difficult for us to respond in a unified manner.
However, we've finally reached
the point where we are capable of full-scale operations.
Upon multiple analyses primarily
conducted by the Operations Command,
we have completed what we believe to be
the best strategy for this upcoming battle.
We consider it imperative that
the media and the people of the world offer their support.
As such, we would like to disclose the content of our strategy in detail.
If you would, Vice Chief of Staff Komine.
Sir!
Huh? Lt. Amane, what are you doing here?
Why can't I be here?
Isn't it almost time for you to explain the strategy to the media?
Weren't you were the central figure behind devising this plan?
Look.
Allow me to explain our strategy.
The GDF's recent assault on
the enemy base on Planetoid RA221 ended in success.
However, we believe that the enemy is preparing to retaliate.
As such, we have decided to destroy Ragazza,
the enemy's frontline base,
which is located in close proximity to our army base on Ceres.
First we will attack
the enemy with our cutting-edge laser-based system.
To prevent the enemy from rushing us, we will set up a minefield.
On top of that, the mobile troops will
fire in unison with disposable rail guns.
After that, we will enter normal battle.
Having predicted the enemy's path,
we have positioned vessels in front of Ceres
that will fire a volley of guided
sublight speed guns and free electron cannons.
Afterwards, we will focus on absolute defense
until the light wave weapon is fully charged.
Once the heavy tactical laser has charged,
the vanguard mobile troops and vessels will leave
the laser's line of fire.
Upon evacuation, we will destroy the
Wulgaru base along with their fleet!
That is all!
With this, the Battle of Ceres,
the GDF will do everything within its power to win this war!
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Let me introduce her.
She will be in charge of managing your schedules,
Miss Peko Yamada.
It's a pleasure!
Th-the pleasure's mine.
She is boarding the mother ship with us.
I'll be supervising your schedules and everyday lives.
If you run into any difficulties in your work or daily lives,
please feel free to come see me for advice!
I'll even give you tips on love!
In that case, I could use some personal advi-
Please look after them.
Sure, Captain!
Excuse me!
Yes?
Um, what should we do?
Are we supposed to participate in that Battle of Ceres
they just announced?
Yes, but you'll be on standby for a while first.
S-standby?
You're free to do as you like on Star Rose.
Now I have a meeting to attend.
Shall we get going?
I've prepared new rooms for everyone on Star Rose.
Here!
You can also use it for purchases in the mess hall and at kiosks.
Please let me know if you need anything else.
Well, take care!
Uh, thanks.
Everyone gets their own room, huh?
This is mine!
Awesome!
It's like a VIP room...
It's so different from the dorm!
Everyone, go to your own room!
I-I guess we should.
Let's go to our rooms.
So what are all of you doing in my room?
Well, uh, it felt right...
My room gives me the willies.
These rooms are too big for just one person.
Wanna live together?
Wh-why don't we check out the mess hall?
They have curry!
Excuse me! Do you have pickled fish guts?
I'm going back to my room.
I'm not terribly hungry, either.
Sorry.
Izurucchi!
Why doncha join us?
Would you like something? I'll get it for you.
I'd recommend the yakiniku meal for today.
Th-then I'll have that.
Just hang tight!
Thanks!
Your schooling.
Huh?
I heard you graduated.
Uh, right.
Congrats!
Yeah...
You don't seem too happy about it.
It happened so fast.
And now I don't have a home to return to.
Thanks for waiting!
But aren't you going to come back here from now on?
Just think of us as your family!
Family...?
We're something like family.
Be sure to return,
Be sure to return, once you've taken off in flight,
Be sure to return, once you've taken off in flight, Migratory Bird.
You don't have to respond to that.
Y-you see, I don't have any memories of my family,
so I'm not sure what it's like.
But supposedly I had foster parents for a while...
You'll find out what it's like.
It's been a long time since I left the nest.
Now this vessel feels like home.
I think of Degawa as my father and Dan as my older brother.
Okay...
What's wrong?
Well, heroes are supposed to be loners.
What?
Finish eating?
Y-yeah.
Is something the matter?
It doesn't feel like I ate.
The Battle of Ceres is disconcerting, isn't it?
There's that, too.
But my pit crew also wanted to talk.
I couldn't relax.
Say what?!
You're doing better with yours than I am mine!
Totally! You've got it good!
I wanna swap with Kei!
Isn't Kei's crew filled with hot babes?
Not again...
Compared to that, mine's filled with...
And mine...
Ah J
My crew seems like it was originally a family.
They even have a kid.
If this is where we're permanently stationed,
do you think they'll want to talk every day?
It must be rough having a family.
That just made me feel a bit better!
Why?
Not having a family might actually make life pretty carefree, huh?
Indeed.
So why is everyone in my room?!
I'm going to copy this.
F-fine...
What are you doing?!
This ain't the place for manga-drawing brats!
How did you sneak in here?
Uh, well, ummm...
Hey!
What's going on here?
We'll help you out!
Are you making fun of our pilot?
He is doing a splendid job fighting the enemy!
He's the one out there protecting us!
Let's go!
Damn!
Th-thank you very much!
There's no need to thank us.
It's no big.
You're awesome!
Izuru, you can really draw!
Make me the hero in your next piece!
This is great!
Heroes with families can be nice too, huh?
What?
This is Godinion. Requesting permission for takeoff.
This is control. Godinion is cleared for takeoff.
Cleared for takeoff. All ranges: Green.

Before start check: Complete. Increasing backup engine output.
Before start check: Complete. External power has been established.

Internal pressure increasing. Turbines activated.
Main engine military!
Blast off!
You've checked their heavy armament, exchanged malfunctioning parts
and swapped anything that has given any errors, right?
They just need one last fine tuning.
The Battle of Ceres is our first big battle, isn't it?
That's true for the AHSMB, too.
I hope the AHSMB units don't decide to turn tail and run.
The JURIA-SYSTEM...
It's insane how much it improves the machine's response time,
but it's extremely difficult to control.
It's an amazing yet annoying system.
If it responds too strongly to the pilot, it falls apart!
I imagine we'll use their full armament and pit crews for this battle.
This reminds me of the F1's crew...
Leave them to me!
We've been working on how to repair
the AHSMB while they're in the midst of battle.
What?!
Everyone in the pit crews will offer their full support!
Pleguzes Jiart, thank you for your participation.
I swear that we will protect you.
I do not need your protection.
I have no intention of participating in the shikaara.
I am here only here in case Teoria shows herself.
Pleguzesia...
That which I want never falls within my grasp!
It drives my lusts and stimulates my instincts!
Isn't this pretty close to Ceres?
Yeah.
When are we gonna sortie?
Once we get the orders.
When'll that be?!
Pipe down!
Come to think of it, where's Suruga?
Awesome!
On top of the usual fare, I've got massive anti-ship guided missiles,
high-mobility guided missiles and a midrange impact cannon!
You may be strappin' tough guns, but you're still squishy.
Let's do push-ups together until it's time to sortie!
Sweating with guys just isn't my thing...
What?!
Th-that aside, can I glue this on somewhere?
All AHSMB pilots, board your units!
Prepare to sortie! Please!
Once you've boarded, wait there until further notice.
Uh, okay!
Do your best to remain calm.
If you shrink from battle, the AHSMBs will focus on defense.
Let's do our best, Asagicchi!
Huh? Why the heck did you call me that?
Izuru was trying to help you loosen up, Asagi.
Izuru!
I'll do my best to become a hero.
The goal behind DNA is to survive and create copies of itself.
The JURIA-SYSTEM awakens various instincts.
Consequentially, it horribly shakes the pilot's heart.
Operation commences in T-30 minutes.
Enemy vessels at Point Tango!
What?!
The enemy is attacking our primary line of defense!
They out-maneuvered us!
Fire your railgun!
It's too late! Fire your railgun!
We've lost 70 of the 1st Mobile Strike Force.
Then fight back!
Please wait! We aren't ready to-
I can't! Commence the attack!
We're starting?!
Battle of Ceres
