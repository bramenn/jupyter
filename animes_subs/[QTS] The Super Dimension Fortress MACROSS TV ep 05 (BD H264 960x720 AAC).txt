Piercing through the Macro sky,
a thunderbolt strikes the Earth
To awaken us, the young mankind,
the Light struck
Macross! Macross!
The brave youths who arise
and fight to protect their loved ones
will set out on their journey as the war rages on
Will you love me tomorrow?
Slicing through the darkness, they fly toward
that blue planet that shines in the distance
Macross! Macross! Macross!
To evade the sudden alien attack,
the space battleship Macross executed a hyperspace fold,
catapulting the surrounding city, the island and even some of the nearby ocean
far into space, to arrive near the orbit of Pluto.
The rescued civilians aboard the Macross,
have recovered from their initial shock.
While unable to completely shake free of their anxiety,
the refugees slowly began to pick up the pieces,
and the city has begun to regain its balance.
TRANSFORMATION
We waited in line all that time, and this is what they give us?!
Yeah...
Minmay. Should you be out of bed so soon?
Sure. I'm fine now, Auntie.
Well, that's good to hear.
By the way, where's Hikaru?
I don't know. Isn't he still asleep?
I wouldn't be surprised.
After all, he had to take care of you for more than a week!
I guess you're right. Anyway, Auntie...
Once we get things straightened up, are we going to reopen the restaurant?
Reopen the restaurant?!
Sure! I mean, look at everything we've salvaged!
Yeah, but the only food rations they gave us were these.
That's all?
But, the restaurant stayed open during the Unification Wars, right?
Well, the military did give us special wartime ration status, but...
Besides, we're on a spaceship.
That's not the point.
If you say you're reopening the restaurant, I'm sure they'll give you more rations.
Please, Uncle? Auntie?
Well, why not? We can't keep loafin' around here forever.
You're right. Maybe re-opening the restaurant would be a nice way to keep ourselves busy.
Okay! We'll be the first to give it a try!
Great! It's settled, then!
I'll go get changed!
Typical Minmay...
We'd better get busy, too.
You're right.
Careful, Minmay!
Okay!
There we go...
This is good, right?
Yup.
What are you up to? Indeed!
Oh, Mr. Mayor. We're reopening the restaurant, of course!
Reopening the restaurant?!
Are you serious? On a battleship out at the edge of space?!
Oh, come on, Mr. Mayor!
Even if we are far away from the Earth and inside a spaceship,
this is still our town, isn't it?
We should do things the way we always have!
Y'know, you're absolutely right!
Huh? Check it out!
Hey, is this restaurant really open?
I'm so happy! You soldiers are the first patrons of our Chinese restaurant in space!
Well, we're honored.
Say, you're that Minmay girl everyone's talking about, right?
They say you had quite an adventure.
That's right! It was really rough!
I hear you were all alone with some guy for nearly two weeks.
So, what did you two do?
Do?
C'mon, don't play dumb!
You know what we mean!
Oh, that's enough!
You really didn't do anything?
Not a thing!
Hey, yeah. I hear the guy's stayin' in a room upstairs here.
And...? What's your point?
So, you two fell for each other and now you're a couple, right?
I swear, you're making me angry! It's nothing like that!
He's just a friend!
Now, are you going to order or not?
Right, right. I'll have some ramen.
Yeah, ramen sounds good.
Well, I'll have ramen, too!
Okay, that's three orders of ramen.
Just a friend, huh?
If we're going to die anyway,
let's get it over with and throw ourselves out into space!
Let's die together!
And the very next day, I'm just a friend, huh?
Well? Does it look like we can use the main gun?
Sir!
Please, take a look at this.
This is the main reactor.
And this is the energy converter for the main gun.
They were initially connected to the Fold System via energy conduits, but...
The connection was broken when the fold system disappeared, eh?
We don't have the resources to repair that amount of conduit.
What can we do?
Sir. We exploit the modular block structure of the Macross.
In short, we replace this block with this one.
I see.
However, the problem is that the main gun simply will not fire
unless we first carry out this transformation.
Transformation?
Yes.
The ship will undergo structural changes internally and externally,
causing major disruptions in the process.
And, there's no other way to use the main gun?
Correct. I'm afraid that the transformation is our only option.
We can't do it.
To throw the city into chaos again just as we're getting it quieted down...
I just can't do that.
Hey, there! We'd like two orders of chashumen and fried rice!
Coming up!
Hikaru, where are you going?
Hikaru...
How terrible...
Hikaru!
I finally found you!
Sempai!
You little cockroach!
Huh?
No matter what happens, you always survive, just like a cockroach!
That's just mean! Don't go putting me in the same category as you!
Yeah, maybe so!
I'm glad you're all right.
What's with this scrap heap here?
Scrap?
Sempai, this racer was the second most important thing to me, right after my own life!
And, you call it scrap?!
But, it's wrecked and that's a fact. What's done is done.
Jeez...
What do you say Hikaru? You up for a walk?
Just look at that gloomy face of yours. It's not like you!
Sempai! Those fighters can fly in space, too!
Uh-huh. The Valkyries have thermo-nuclear reaction engines.
With that much thrust, they can fly just about anywhere.
It's incredible!
Sempai?
How about it, Hikaru?
Don't you feel like trying to fly one of those again?
You mean join the military?
Well, it's pointless to just hang around here and do nothing.
What is it, Hikaru?
Sempai...
I...
Can a girl change in a single day?
What?!
Can a girl be completely different today from how she was yesterday?
You don't have to laugh at me!
You've fallen for her, haven't you?
Huh?!
N...No, that's not...
Relax, Hikaru.
Minmay was the one who said you were feeling down,
and that I should come check on you.
So, cheer up and go on back and show her you're smiling.
The thing is, girls like her are pretty fickle.
Make sure you don't lose her to another man!
Sempai...
What? You have data on the alien homeworld?
Yes, we were able to capture some images. Please observe.
These were taken by a reconnaissance Reguld.
Wh...What?!
So, these aliens are miclones?
Yes, sir. I also realized as much upon viewing this.
There is an ancient legend in the old Zentradi military records...
What is it?
Sir. It says, Avoid the worlds of the miclones.
Avoid the worlds of the miclones, eh?
I believe we should not have any further contact with this world.
Instead, we should concentrate on pursuing the target battleship.
Understood. Fold at once and initiate pursuit!
Yes, sir.
Once we've de-folded, send a detachment of ships to investigate.
I want to probe their capabilities.
Oh, Hikaru. You're back.
Did you want something?
Uh, it's nothing really.
It's all right. Come in.
Please.
Oh, would you open the window for me?
Is something wrong?
No, it's nothing.
Isn't that...
Didn't I smash this when I was in the Battroid?
Don't worry about it.
And what's this?
It's something I forgot and decided to go back for.
You ended up saving me while I was getting it.
I'll bet it's a letter from a boyfriend, right?
No way! You can read it if you like.
This says you passed the preliminary round for a singing audition!
You mean...?
Uh-huh!
Well, no wonder you sing so well!
Thank you.
Not that it matters now.
We're not on Earth anymore.
C'mon, don't talk like that!
When we get back to Earth, you can get another audition, right?
If we get back.
Say, Hikaru.
Do you have a dream?
A dream?
Yeah.
A dream...
I had one, but it broke.
Now, it's just scrap.
You mean your airplane?
Yeah. Now I don't have any dreams.
Really...
A de-fold reaction has been detected at six o'clock!
We have a report from the radar room.
Unidentified objects have appeared behind us and are closing fast.
Enemy ships!
So they've come.
Hayase! Take us to battle stations, now!
Aye, sir!
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!
Valkyrie squadrons, all units, scramble!
I repeat, Valkyrie squadrons, all units, scramble!
Wow! The town looks so nice, doesn't it?
Yeah...
Air-raid alert! Air-raid alert!
Will we be all right?
Relax. Sempai and the others will take care of it.
It's always Sempai, Sempai with you, isn't it?
You're as good a pilot as he is, you know.
Dammit! They're a lot more slippery here than they were on the ground.
This is gonna take some work.
Our lead detachment has moved into firing range.
Strange. They're not firing their main gun.
Damned miclones. What are they up to?
Why not provoke them a little more and see how they react?
Yes. That is acceptable.
Authorize the lead detachment to open fire.
Enough to get the enemy ship to return fire.
What was that?!
The enemy ships are firing on us!
A section of the sub-control systems has been damaged!
However, it looks like we'll be able to manage somehow.
I'm counting on you.
Captain!
We've lost auxiliary gun turrets Numbers 2 and 5.
Immediate repair is impossible.
Section 4 has been heavily damaged.
Sub-control systems report heavy damage and several casualties!
That's it! Send a message to all sections: Prepare to fire the main gun!
We're going to initiate the ship-wide transformation!
But, if we do that, the city will be...!
Th...That's right!
Just do it! We don't have much time!
Attention all sections! Attention all sections!
Take positions for firing the main gun!
Transformation will commence in three minutes!
Huh? Did she say transformation?!
No way! That's just nuts!
T-minus two minutes, thirty seconds!
Oh hell!
Attention all civilians.
Our ship is to make a transformation in 60 seconds.
Transformation?
For your safety, please hold tightly onto anything within reach.
What's that?
Beats me...
I bet Mr. Focker and the others are in battle right now, huh?
Are you saying, I should join the military?
That's not exactly what I mean, but...
I guess.
But, if I join the military, you and I won't get to see each other very much.
Don't be silly! We're on the same ship, aren't we?
And, we can see each other whenever you have time off.
If I survive, that is.
But, it's the same for all the soldiers who come to the restaurant.
All the same, huh?
To you, I guess I'm no different from any of them.
T-minus ten seconds.
Problems in any of the sections?
G block and D block are a little behind, but they should be able to manage.
Good.
T-minus five seconds.
Three.
Two.
One.
Zero.
Initiate ship-wide transformation!
J, K and L blocks, initiate transformation!
Please increase output to the No. 7 reactor.
Transformation is underway in section 78.
There's insufficient power in J block.
Ship-wide transformation is underway.
Maybe I'd be happier if the city and everything else
was blasted to space dust.
What?! How can you say something so selfish?
I hate you!
Fine by me! Me too, I...
Minmay!
Minmay!
Hikaru!
Three minutes have elapsed since the order to begin transformation.
Reconfiguration is now 11.5 complete.
What the...?!
Transformation of the starboard section is 75 complete.
Transformation of the port section is 80 complete.
Main gun system is nominal!
So, that's the Macross's...
Transformation is complete!
The enemy ships have launched 40 or 50 smaller units, closing rapidly.
Never mind them! Fire the main gun!
Yes, sir!
Wh...What?!
What is this?
The enemy ships have been destroyed.
All right!
We did it! Thank goodness!
Get me a ship-wide damage report at once.
Attention all civilians.
Our sincerest apologies, but thanks to your cooperation,
we were able to fire the main gun and destroy the enemy.
If you were injured or your home was damaged,
please inform your nearest branch office or police substation.
Well, you said you wanted the city to be destroyed.
Well, but... I didn't think that something like THIS would happen.
I wonder if the restaurant was destroyed.
I'm going to do it, Minmay!
Huh?
I'm going to join the military!
Hikaru!
I can't just keep standing around doing nothing, can I?
Valkyrie squadrons, return to base!

DAEDALUS ATTACK
I won't follow it anymore,
the shadow you cast as you run away
We all keep running until the end,
but we still can't see the goal
What awaits us after today?
What awaits us beyond tomorrow?
Even now, I keep running toward
The light that shines so far away
