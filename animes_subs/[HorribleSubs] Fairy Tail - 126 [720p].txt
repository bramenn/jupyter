I can't take any more... I'm at my limit...
Let me off...
You just need to suck it up for another two hours! Hang in there, Natsu!
What a pathetic man!
You people...
Wendy, lay another Troia on the poor guy!
At this rate, Natsu will melt into nothingness before we reach our destination!
All right, then...
Troia!
Huh? It's not working!
The Truly Evil Jiggle Butt Gang!
I'm gonna die! Do something!
Huh? That's strange!
I'll try it once more!
It's not really making a difference...
Troia! Troia! Troia!
It's not having any effect!
Why not?!
Usually, he feels better right away...
A power shortage?
It can only be one thing...
With the spell cast on him every time he got on some form of transportation...
A-A Troia resistance?!
I don't believe it! Is that even possible?!
It certainly is possible.
He's slow on the uptake, though, which is why it worked as long as it did.
There's nothing we can do about it, Natsu.
You'll just have to rely on will power alone
to get you through the next two hours.
My goodness...
You people...
Easy for you to say...
This time, Natsu and the others have accepted a job from a wealthy person,
their mission to safely escort a great deal of gold by freight
to their client's connection.
The trip takes six hours from Magnolia, heading due west across the continent.
Thus far, four hours have passed without incident,
but Natsu and the rest had no way of knowing
that a terrible evil was silently creeping towards them...
Alright! You two better get fired up!
Yes, sir!
For we're the notorious robbers...
The Jiggle Butt Gang!
Sound off, Lackey A!
Yes, sir!
Lackey B!
Yes, sir!
Right now, we're about to embark on
Operation: Steal the Gold Cargo from the Freight Train and Good Riddance!
Alright!
Sneak!
Sneak!
Sneak!
Sneak-sneak-sneak-sneak-sneak...
Sneak!
Okay. That's the freight car!
Just one more step to the treasure.
Our plan is flawless...
W-W-W-Who the hell is he?!
What's he doing in there?!
What do we do?!
Revise the plan?!
Don't panic. True evil doesn't revise its plans!
At a time like this, true evil gets crafty!
Listen, you two! While I distract that guy, you scout out the freight car!
Roger!
Are you okay?! Pull yourself together!
Skulk-butt...
Slink-butt...
What's wrong, laddy, you got motion sickness?!
Sneak-butt...
Yeah, well... I don't know who you are, but I feel a little better now.
Worrying about a complete stranger, old man...
That makes you a good guy in my book...
A good guy?!
Compared to the jerks in there, who accepted this job
even though they knew I'd get motion sickness...
Job? What kind of job is that?
We're escorting this freight.
Oh... So your comrades are bodyguards, eh?
We can sneak a peek through here.
Quietly, quietly...
Open-butt...
Don't worry about it, Wendy!
It's no use. When something like this happens,
it takes a long time for her to snap out of it.
And Natsu knew he'd get sick on this job,
so maybe he shouldn't have signed on from the start.
You're right, but he seemed to have nothing else going on...
Still, for magic not to work at a time when it's really needed,
that makes me a failure as a wizard.
That's taking it too far!
Wizard?!
I know how you feel, laddy.
It's tough when things don't work out smoothly with your colleagues...
Even more so when you're the leader!
You understand my viewpoint, old man?!
Hey, you gonna be okay?!
Boss!
W-What?! You scared the crap out of me!
There are people inside!
I know. They're guarding the cargo.
It turns out they're wizards!
They've all got this mark!
Then they're in a guild, eh?
That's a bit of a nuisance.
I'm all out of stuff to throw up!
Huh? There are more of you?
These are my buddies!
They're nice guys too, so they came to look after you!
When someone's in need, it's not in their nature to look the other way.
You're all good guys!
Don't throw in the towel, laddy! Us good guys are behind you all the way!
Natsu? Come on in.
I wonder if he feels better...
He's dense, so maybe it just took time for the magic to take effect.
Natsu-san, what's wrong?!
Hello, there!
Pardon us!
Um... M-May I ask who you are?
Please excuse us...
Hey! Only authorized people are allowed in here...
The thing is, we found this young man lying unconscious out there...
Unconscious?!
Oh, dear! This is more serious than I thought!
Oh, for crying out loud...
Natsu-san...
Natsu! Wake up!
What the...?!
Don't move! Unless you don't care what happens to this girl?!
Oh, Boss, you're so cool!
Now that's true evil!
True evil?! Don't tell me you guys are after this freight...
Bingo! And we ain't afraid of any wizards!
We're the truly evil...
Jiggle...
What the heck is that...?
Lame...
And Natsu's totally out of it...
Everyone, shut up!
Build up power, you bastards!
Alright!
Hey, you three... what are you doing?!
This is even lamer...
I think I'm gonna throw up...
Listen up! The Jiggle Butt Gang has commandeered this cargo!
And I think we'll have all of you jump out of the train!
Don't talk stupid! Like any of us would obey an order from villains like you!
Are you in any position to talk like that?!
Lucy-san...
It'll be okay, Wendy!
I swear we'll save you!
Your appearance isn't the only thing that's dirty!
Time to make your choice! You gonna jump off the train or not?!
Well?!
Well?!
Well, well, well!
Well!
We're all charged up! Let's go, Secret Jiggle Butt Art!
Gas-Butt...
Triple...
Ecstasy!
Stinks!
Everyone!
My nose is wrinkling! The stink is permeating my clothes!
My skin is getting chapped! Oh, and I'm falling!
This is how we die?!
You'd let yourself die like this?!
Thanks, you two!
No good! I can't focus my strength with that odor lingering in my nose!
Same here...
Give me a break... We're falling!!
Huh? Where is everyone?
Plue! Then you're safe!
Natsu-san! Please wake up!
Hello... Hello...?
Huh? What is this thing?
Plue is a Celestial Spirit.
Plue...
He's strangely cute...
It sends a shock to the raging heart of this evil robber...
Um...
Lackey A, Lackey B, get up!
It stinks...
Look! Look! This is a Celestial Spirit!
Have you ever seen such a thing?!
Celestial Spirit?!
Cute...
So soothing...
Charming...
E-Excuse me...
Whoa! Our truly evil plans are getting off track!
You need to get fired up again! 23 push-ups!
We have to do it?!
That's kind of a half-assed number!
Enough, just do it!
1-2-3-4...
I'm sure everyone's okay.
Now it's up to me to protect the gold!
What do you intend to do next?
That goes without saying. We're just here for the gold.
Unless you can protect it all on your own, little lady?
Plue is here, too!
You're still useful to us as hostages!
And if you try meddling with our plans,
what do you think's gonna happen to him?
Boss...
We're done with the push-ups...
This ain't no time to relax! Lackey B, get to work!
Yes, sir!
An explosive?!
Alright!
Success!
Oh, no! The cargo!
Now the gold belongs to the Jiggle Butt Gang!
So long!
Prepare propulsive force!
Wave two of Gas-Butt Triple Ecstasy!
Fire!
Hey, up there...
We're going after them, you two!
Well, the inside of my nose is clean now, so...
Did you see that, guild?! Did you see that, wizards?!
Nothing is impossible for the Jiggle Butt Gang!
But the train will soon stop, won't it?
Are you going to fire off a round of gas every time it does?
On top of that, it doesn't look like you brought along any equipment,
so how are you going to carry the freight away?
There's no way you neglected to think about that, right?
We've stopped!
What are we gonna do, Boss?!
Did you really think I hadn't planned for this?!
With our muscles, there isn't anything we can't... do...
So then...
We're gonna rely on my leg muscles!
Boss!
Ow!!
Are you all right?!
Do I look all right?!
In that case...
Miss...
Healing Magic is my specialty.
I just hope it relieves at least a little of your pain...
Boss, how do you feel?
Oh... All of a sudden, the pain disappearing!
This girl is no ordinary girl, huh?
Thanks, little lady. That's much better.
Thank goodness...
But y'know, if you've got that kinda power, you oughta use it on him, too.
I would if I could.
I do have a spell for motion sickness,
but I used it so much on him that it's stopped working altogether...
I've got to become a higher-level wizard...
You've got it rough, huh, Miss?
No, I don't, really.
Everyone in Fairy Tail is really nice.
I'm happy that I joined the guild.
She's bravely holding back her tears!
You know, I don't really see you as being all that bad.
Hold it right there! You helped me and all,
but there's no worse insult than saying those words to the truly evil!
Listen, when you're truly evil...
Isn't it more important for you to figure out how to carry the cargo away?
The girl has a good point.
How are we gonna carry the gold?
Lackeys, assemble!
Yes, sir!
Recently, my butt's starting to sag...
I have to be sharp here...
What would Natsu-san and Lucy-san do at a time like this?
That's it!
Excuse me, everyone!
What?!
You scared me!
If you really want gold that badly,
I'll negotiate on your behalf with our client
to try to get him to share a little bit with you.
You would do that?!
In exchange, I want you to make a promise.
That you'll never do something bad like this again...
That's kind of a tall order...
Fine, then give up on the gold.
Don't be like that!
If you make me that promise, I'll get this freight car moving.
You're able to do that?!
Yes! Seeing your gas propulsion method gave me an idea.
You're gonna do Gas-Butt Ecstasy?!
No!
Alright, we'll go along with your idea, young lady.
Lackeys, assemble!
Listen, we'll just pretend to cooperate with her.
The truly evil can't be satisfied with just a smidgen of gold!
We'll put her at ease and then, as soon as we have our chance,
we'll take it all!
You're a genius, Boss!
The truly evil don't think like the common herd, huh?
Okay, young lady, would you get this train going?
How's she gonna do it without using Gas-Butt?
You got me... But little as she is, she's a wizard with a guild mark.
She can probably let loose with powerful magic...
Show us what you've got.
Okay, here I go!
Roar of the Sky Dragon!
Incredible!
What is this?!
That magic...
It's Wendy's!
Happy, hurry!
Aye, sir!
How's this? I think we'll be able to make up for lost time in one shot.
Miss, do you happen to be... one of them Dragon Slayers?
Yes, actually...
Please let us call you Lady Boss!
It's the first time we've ever met someone with this much power!
Please join the Jiggle Butt Gang... No, let us call you our goddess!
And then...
After that, we'll follow you anywhere!
I'm the one who should say, Ehhh!
Lackeys, assemble!
Are you serious about making her our goddess?!
I'm as serious as serious can get... As if!
Look, with the powerful magic she can wield,
the best thing for us to do is get her on our side!
We'll use this golden opportunity to gain a strong ally!
You're a genius, Boss!
What should I do?
I guess I have no choice but pretend to be on their side for now...
I have to do my best here!
I'm the only one who can protect the gold!
In other words, our plan is gonna be to...
Excuse me...
C-Cute...
Wonderful! This is my finest moment of being with the Jiggle Butt Gang!
Then you've agreed to become our goddess?!
Yes...
In that case, we start with this pose!
We're the notorious robbers...
The Jiggle Butt Gang!
The train's stopped!
Goddess! If you would...
Certainly!
Roar of the...
Hold it!
What?!
Natsu-san is in there!
Okay...
What kind of cosplay is that?
Wendy... What's the story with that outfit?
Oh, this is, uh...
Natsu! Wake up!
Are you up? Are you alright now?
Has the train stopped?
I think Wendy's in trouble!
What?!
You fiends! What have you done to Wendy?!
And if it's bad, I'll bite through your windpipes!
Please help us, goddess!
There's no resisting this.
Lackeys, assemble!
She's consorting with them...
Why are they listening to Wendy?
And what do they mean by goddess?
Give up on being truly evil and turn over a new leaf.
Why don't you study to become wizards?
Fairy Tail offers a correspondence course.
How about sending away for the materials?
Goddess... You're thinking about our welfare that much?
Now that you mention it, we never thought about...
Lady Boss! You really are the best!
What happened...?
She ends up soothing even the worst of evil criminals...
It's Wendy's style to go that far.
Her style?
Hey, you three!
Natsu!
I told him everything!
Wendy, the bad guys are threatening you, right?
That's not what's going on, Happy!
You acted all nice to me... because you're thieves, yeah?
You dared deceive me!
Fire!
Iron Fist...
Natsu-san, wait! I'm in the middle of convincing them!
Look at them fly...
I don't think they're really that bad...
Why did you make me wait so long?!
Our apologies! We had a little trouble along the way...
I can't do this anymore...
After that, you got sick all over again, huh?
Anyway, you'll be paid half the agreed-upon fee!
That's pretty harsh...
Wendy! Now's the time to work your magic!
Go and sooth this guy's heart!
I'll never forgive that Gas-Butt Brigade!
The Jiggle Butt Gang never gives up!
We're gonna keep going full speed ahead'til we master true evil!
Oh! That was so inspiring!
I'll follow you anywhere!
Let's go! Gas-Butt Triple Ecstasy!
Alright! Second star to the right, and straight on to true evil!
Straight on!
We'll be back!!
It's Evil Lord Happy!
Take this! Roar of the Fire Dragon!
What's wrong, Salamander?! I'm over here!
Damn! It's against the rules to turn invisible!
Face me fair and square!
You're looking the wrong way!
Next time: The Terror of Invisible Lucy!
I don't think that would work for you, Happy.
Once in a while, I wanna be in the spotlight, too!
That's a really sad reason...
