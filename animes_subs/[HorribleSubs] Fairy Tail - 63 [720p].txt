We finally defeated the commander of Oracion Seis, Brain!
That dude Jura's crazy powerful!
But Nirvana isn't stopping...
And we don't even know how to stop it!
What'll we do?
We will never give in.
For our hopes are already as one!
This is the guild which Wendy and Carla are members of, Caitshelter.
Everyone, we've got a big problem!
It's Nirvana!
Nirvana is heading this way!
What?
The alliance plan failed?
Even with Jura and Erza with them?
Master!
Nabula...
Don't pour if you're gonna drink straight from the bottle!
Nabula...
Listen, Nirvana is heading here...
What? For truth?
Swallow first, then talk!
Nirvana is heading this way?
Is this fate? Or merely coincidence-nabula?
I hope that Wendy is safe...
Yeah.
We're not actually any help in a pinch.
Swallow, then talk!
The power of the magic of light still lives!
Nabula! It shines brightly!
But, this is no coincidence...
There's someone who knows our real identity.
That must be why they're aiming for here.
Nabula...
We've been together for who knows how long, and I still don't know what nabula means.
Master, let's evacuate!
Our barrier can't protect against Nirvana!
You fools!
There are people who are fighting-nabula, and trying to stop it!
For those who believe in victory, there is no need to move!
So I say...
But perhaps the time has come.
The time for us to pay for our crimes.
It is Your Words.
Stop it?
But we don't know how to stop it!
Like, breaking it?
Yup, figures you'd think like that.
How do you plan on breaking something this huge?
It would be faster to ask Brain.
Will he tell us just like that, I wonder?
Maybe Jellal would know...
Did you say something?
Is something the matter?
No, it's nothing.
I think I might be on to something. I want to check it out.
Wendy, wait!
Hey!
What's with her?
Everyone, can you hear me?
It is me, Hot Eye.
Mass telepathy?
Who is it?
It is Richard-dono! You are unharmed?
Unfortunately, I am injured.
I was no match for Midnight, as I feared.
Everyone, please work together to defeat Midnight!
If you defeat him, Nirvana's supply of magical power will be cut off,
and the city should come to a halt.
Who is it?
So, it moves using Body Link magic...
He is directly below the King's Summit.
Be careful. He is very, very powerful!
Richard-dono...
Directly below us?
Okay! I can see the light at the end of the tunnel!
Powerful, huh?
I'm getting fired up!
Natsu... It's to stop this thing, remember?
Right! Let's go!
Of the six prayers, only one is left.
I believe in everyone!
You will surely win, and be able to stop Nirvana!
Please...
Richard-dono!
You won't get away with this...
You'll pay...
There?
Okay!
Show yourself, you drowsy bastard!
It's a trap!
What was that explosion?
It was toward the King's Summit...
Father is such a bad person, taking away all my fun.
You two are now the final prey.
I do hope this will be entertaining.
Stand back, Erza.
Jellal...
Damn it... That hurt.
Is everyone alive?
Aye...
What happened? We were caught up in that giant explosion and...
We're buried?
Wait, this is...
Old dude!
Jura!
He protected us?
Gramps!
Stay well, young ones...
I am glad you are safe.
Old dude!
Hang in there!
Jura!
Damn it all!
It's definitely heading toward Caitshelter.
Wendy, I'm sorry, but I can't fly much farther.
Okay. Sorry, Carla.
Let's search for Jellal on foot.
You have a good sense of smell, after all.
But that Jellal smells a little different than the one I know.
A-Anyway, let's search for Jellal.
He might be able to stop this thing.
Right.
Please be safe, Jellal...
It seems like you forgot about me, but I haven't forgotten about you for a single day.
It didn't hit?
Stop it, Jellal...
It's impossible for you with your body like that.
I will...
Come here.
Pitiful... This is that Jellal?
Just a pathetic clown.
Did you forget how to use magic along with your memories, Jellal-kun?
Someone like Jellal defeated so easily?
Oh? Still alive?
No... It's that he used up more magic power casting the self-destruction magic circle on himself than I had thought.
I want to see you suffer in fear even more.
Time for the main dish already, Erza Scarlet?
My sword slash was deflected?
Erza, stand back! This guy's dangerous!
Again?
What?
Erza!
I see...
So that is your magic!
Yes... My Reflector can warp and twist anything.
It can reflect back magic, and using the bending of light, can even make illusions.
What incredible magic...
Here I come!
Didn't you hear me?
Magic cannot hit me!
What'll we do?
He's hurt bad!
Don't die on us, dude!
It was a trap...
What a joke...
Brain used up all the rest of his power and could only get rid of one of you.
Who is it?
Up there!
Pitiful...
He's a disgrace to the Six Generals.
Well, as long as Midnight is here, we haven't been defeated.
Perhaps I will clean up the rest of you fools.
The...
The...
The...
The staff is talking!
You talk too, even though you're a cat.
Aye...
That's the staff that Brain had.
What's going on?
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey- hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-now!
Wait, we don't know what it is!
Stop this big city, you rotted stick!
R-Rotted stick? How rude!
Stick I'll accept, but what do you mean rotted, huh?
I am the seventh member of Oracion Seis.
I have awakened from my slumber to defeat...
I said stop this city!
Huh? But Oracion Seis has 6 members.
Professor Happy's Fairy Tail Lectures!
That's right!
There are six members, and thus Six Wizard Generals.
The name is read as Oracion Seis.
Huh? That is strange.
See? There are supposed to be six, so what's with the seventh?
And wait... Are we dropping the whole talking staff thing already?
It's all so ridiculous I don't know where to start.
You violent brat...
Soon I'll be able to see the guild of those fools...
I must clean up the trash without delay.
You mean Caitshelter?
Exactly! We will begin our destruction by crushing them!
Dance, my blades!
You think you can hit me through sheer number?
I told you before that I could reflect attacks back.
Erza!
More...
Show me even more suffering!
Nothing is better than that expression on your face...
Impressive, as I thought.
But...
Spiral Pain!
Oh, no!
Over already?
So powerful...
Please don't die yet, Erza.
Entertain me until we get to Caitshelter.
Caitshelter?
Our first target.
Why attack there?
Because the clan who created Nirvana to stop the war far in the past is there.
The Nirvit.
But Nirvana was a far more dangerous magic than they predicted.
So they sealed away the magic that they themselves created.
Afraid it would be used for evil,
they continued to protect the seal for decades, and then centuries.
Caitshelter is a guild formed specifically by the descendants of the Nirvit.
They have the power to seal Nirvana once again, that is why we must destroy them.
Isn't it a waste to let this incredible power stay asleep?
With this power, the world can be led toward chaos!
This is also a warning to everyone.
We'll force the Nirvit, who love being neutral, to go to war!
With the power of Nirvana, we'll engulf their hearts in darkness, and make them kill each other!
Doesn't it just give you the chills?
You fiend!
Stop acting like you're a good guy, Jellal...
Your...
Your soul is darkness itself, after all.
You are a sinister, vicious man with blood on your hands...
That's not true!
Yes, it is.
You forced children into slave labor.
You killed your friends.
You even tried to kill Erza.
Do you know how many people you've caused to suffer?
Do you know how many people you've frightened, threatened, and made cry?
Jellal...
Come here.
Jellal...
You're a perfect fit for the new Six Generals.
I know...
I know the light within Jellal...
Erza...
You can still stand?
Live, and grab the future in front of you.
It is your words that give me the courage, that are my light.
Just as the rumors say, Erza...
I'll take great satisfaction in destroying you!
I will stop you and your foolish desire!
Without fail.
We're all beat up, and it's now that the strongest enemy shows up?
It's like they hit the reset button!
Our battles before weren't a waste.
And besides, if we beat this guy, it's finally over for real!
Always overly optimistic, huh Natsu?
Just call me a positive thinker!
Next time: Zero!
But what you said is true, Natsu.
See? I said something good, right?
Right?
And now you ruined it.
