You're the one who gives me my future
Even on a road without signs, I'll be fine, if we're together
On a journey that I can't see ahead of, while I was lost, I found it
That my place to be is next to you
When we quarrelled, I let go of your hand again and again
I want to pull close and hold it now
You're the one who gives me my future
If I'm beaten down by the rain of tears
I wanna hold you, call my name immediately
I'll go embrace you
I'll accept sadness and bluffing in my hands
Boy
I suddenly turned my back on you and ran away
Because you've been so gentle to many other girls
Boy, please chase after me
Because it won't be over after this
I can't say I'm sorry, sorry
Even though I believe you, my lips are pouting
I can't be cute, sorry
Catch me in the town where a drizzle is falling
Because I'll turn around and give you a make-up kiss
In your warm arms
The Eastern Pursuit
The Eastern Pursuit
Next Time
Tabitha's Younger Sister
What do you think?
Isn't it a big ship?
It's called the Ostland.
It's the latest exploration ship made based on Mr. Jean Colbert's design.
Miss Zerbst invested in my research.
In other words, it's the fruit of our love!
In any case, we've been away on a test flight these past few days.
But last night, the wind pushed us off course and we happened to be flying around here.
Then we saw you fighting.
It really surprised us.
It surprised me, too.
I mean, I saw you and heard your familiar voice...
I thought I was dreaming.
Me, too.
Since I honestly thought you...
It turns out Tabitha cast a spell to stop one's heart temporarily to make one appear dead.
I took him out of the coffin as soon as she told me.
After that, I had him stay at my house in Germania.
Why did you keep it a secret?
Why couldn't you have told us?!
I'm sorry about that.
I meant to, but I never found the right time to.
I'm sorry for making you worry.
No... I'm glad to know that you are well.
Are you sure you don't need to tell the others you fought that Gallian girl the other day?
Yeah, I should, but... I can't make sense of it yet.
Why did Tabitha do that?
He has that look again.
He's been like that since this morning.
That pervert!
I can't.
If I forgive him so easily, my dignity as his master will fade!
Saito!
What, Louise?
About last night.
What are you talking about?
Don't act dumb!
The incident with the Princess.
Oh, that.
Oh, that?!
Well, we already talked about it last night.
Yes, I remember.
Just how things turned out, right?
Yeah, that's right.
If you think about it, that's not an explanation at all.
Give me a clearer story.
I-I've been a little forgetful these days...
Who do you think the master is?!
Tell me exactly what happened that led to that situation!
I-It hurts.
Hey, Saito.
I'm gathering the Order of Undine Knights.
Y-Yeah!
H-Hey, Saito!
We'll talk about it later.
Tell the whole story, she says...
But I really can't, can I?
Miss Valliere.
What?
I haven't heard the result yet.
What result?
Whether Saito-san found you at the ball last night or not.
Judging from your reaction, he didn't, did he?
T-There was an emergency yesterday.
Making excuses is what sore losers do.
Praise the Queen!
Your Highness!
Long live Her Highness!
Your Highness!
It's Henrietta-sama!
She's always so beautiful.
Y-Yeah.
It really is a magnificent ship.
It will be spoken of in all Halcheginia.
It's an honour, Your Highness.
I heard you used this ship to repel the gargoyles that appeared near the academy last night, as well.
You have my gratitude from the bottom of my heart.
Rather than me, you should thank Saito-kun here.
Saito Chevalier de Hiraga-dono.
I give you my gratitude, as well.
Well, I am your knight, so...
What is this about?
Why is there a strange atmosphere between them?
Hey, Miss Valliere?
That dog... That dog... That dog...
What are you thinking? It's impossible.
The Dog and the Queen? How ridiculous. Damn it.
Saito-san and the Queen were h-hugging?
Shh! Not so loud!
I can't believe it.
With the Queen as a rival, there won't be any chance of winning.
Don't talk like you had a chance before.
But, I mean, it's the Queen!
She can do whatever she wants!
I bet she'll eventually make Saito-san work at the castle.
And when night falls...
What do you mean, when night falls?
I can't say that!
You've gone that far, so out with it!
Then let me put it this way.
In chapter two of The Glorious Day of Countess Butterfly, there's a scene that goes like this.
A noble lady invites a knight to her bedroom and says,
My knight. Serve me the way you wish.
Give me a delusional, sensational joy.
Wait! The Princess would never say that!
That's right! Now... come...
Right to my breasts!
Yes! There! Right there!
U-Um...
T-That was this stupid maid putting on an act!
Is there something on your mind?
Colbert-sensei.
Saito-kun. Do you know the origin of the name of the ship?
No.
Ostland.
In other words, the East.
I named it hoping to go to the far eastern area with you.
The reason I was able to make this ship is you.
Oh, please.
There are many things I want to show you.
Would you come with me?
Yes.
Princess?!
Why did I...
Your Highness.
The return carriage is ready.
I'm a queen.
I must return to my duties.
But...
Is there a problem, Your Highness?
Just a little...
I wish to remain here for a little while longer.
I see. Such a thing happened between Saito-san and the Queen.
You don't seem to be too surprised.
I am, but I think there must be some reason for it.
O-Of course I think so, too!
But because Saito won't say it clearly...
Louise-san.
You can use this if you want to.
What is it?
It's a magic item called Last Night Orb.
Last Night Orb?! I've heard about them!
Why do you know about them?
They're really popular among the wives in the city.
They're disposable, so the stock keeps running out.
Where did you get hold of one?
Beatrice-san gave it to me to settle things between us.
What can we do with this?
If you look at a person through this,
you can see what that person did the previous night.
I hear wives use them to check if their husbands are cheating on them or not.
I-Is that so? But I don't need to use something like this.
I believe Saito-san, too.
But if this makes you feel better...
If I use this, will this sense of anxiety go away?
But...
I'll use it, then.
Huh?
You don't need it, right, Miss Valliere?
I never said that!
Of course I'll use it!
He's my familiar!
Those propellers provide three times the propulsion and allow long-range flying.
Really?
I made it based on your Dragon's Plumage.
It runs on coal.
The steam pressure from boiling water heated with the coal moves the propellers.
I decided to call it the water vapour engine.
What's wrong, Saito-kun?
Well...
You'll see Mr. Colbert's last night!
I know! It's pretty hard to aim.
What are they doing?
Could that be...
Partner, run!
Now!
Okay.
Sensei, excuse me!
O-Okay.
He ran!
Suspicious!
Let's go!
W-Why do I have to run?
What she had in her hand is a scary item that strips a man of everything.
Strips? Why?
Just keep running!
Wait, Saito!
Saito-san!
What is this about?
The usual, I say.
You won't get away, you mutt!
Saito! Stop your futile resistance!
We'll split up!
Then I'll go this way.
U-Um, what about me?
This is the water vapour engine?
It's amazing how he made this just from looking at the Zero.
It brings back memories. There were a lot of these in my world.
Saito-san!
T-Tiffa?
I-I'm sorry.
W-What is this about?
It's for Louise-san's sake.
No, you can't, Tiffa.
Saito-san's here!
Surrender, Saito.
Stop! Stop it!
Stay still!
Stay still!
Gotta go.
Saito!
So this is where you were.
Ah, Miss Zerbst.
I was tuning things for the next flight.
Jean.
How many times do I have to say it?
Call me Kirche.
But I'm a teacher.
It doesn't matter when there's love.
S-Stop it, Miss -
My dear Jean...
S-S -
Oh.
S-Saito-kun!
No, you see! T-This is -
S-Sorry for the disturbance!
Saito!
Thank you for all the trouble, Dog.
Stop it.
You won't run away anymore.
Last Night Orb.
Show me what Saito did last night.
What?
What's this?
Why does it show Tabitha?
Was Tabitha involved last night?
Saito! Tell me!
You're right. Tabitha got in my way when I tried to save you.
But it wasn't of her own will.
Sheffield ordered her to.
She called Tabitha a faithful watchdog or something like that.
It's getting more confusing.
Why does Tabitha listen to that woman?
I think I know.
It might be related to that.
Wait there.
I'll be back soon.
Tabitha isn't an ordinary aristocrat.
She's a member of Gallia's royal family.
Her father was the younger brother of the current King.
Her father was killed during the fight over the throne.
Tabitha was also targeted and had her food poisoned,
but her mother took the poison meant for her.
Ever since, her mother's been mentally ill,
hiding within one room.
After that the Kingdom of Gallia named Tabitha a chevalier and gave her seemingly impossible missions.
Impossible missions?
Monster slaying, dangerous scouting and the like.
We fought you guys at the Lagdorian Lake, remember?
That was one of those.
So yesterday was as well?
I bet it was an order from the Kingdom of Gallia.
I can't forgive them!
Hey, Louise. Let's go to Gallia right now and -
Wait. I'm safe here, so Tabitha failed in her mission, right?
What will happen to her?
Even I don't know that.
But there's always the chance...
Where did you take her?
Where did you take Mother?
Oh, the woman the Gallian Military arrested this morning.
I don't know where they took her.
I'm Vitartial of Neftes.
Nice to meet you.
An elf.
Yes.
We elves do not relish needless fights.
So I ask you to comply and come with me.
To the King of Gallia, Joseph.
I need to take you there.
Nature magic...
I do not like that name.
Call it the power of spirits.
The ones who tried to take Louise away were from Gallia?!
There's no way Tabitha would attack me otherwise.
But why?
Sheffield said she wants my abilities as a void mage.
Your Highness, please let me go to Gallia!
Saito.
I can't forgive them for trying to kidnap Louise.
And to use Tabitha for that... It's too much.
I'll march in and make sure they can't do that again.
You can't do that!
Why not?!
I'll knock them all out and -
You mustn't do such a dangerous thing.
Please leave this to me.
But...
We first need to gather evidence.
If it is Gallia's doing, then I will use this Kingdom's forces...
Promise me you won't do anything rash.
Yes.
Oh dang. We never figured out what happened last night, did we?
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help.
It's fine now.
I told Saito...
Sigh...
It's impossible.
But...
Yet another girl?!
One after another! You pervert dog!
What? Searching for her sister?
Who are you?
Zero no Tsukaima. Princess no Rondo.
Tabitha's Younger Sister.
It's pretty tough for me, too.
I won't forgive you if you look away.
