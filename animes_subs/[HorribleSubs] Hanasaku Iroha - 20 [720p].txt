Omelet rice!
Huh?!
Excuse me...
I'd like to buy this.
Episode 20 Love. Kourin Festival
Rock it hard with an unique, mature look
Is Minchi around?
Oh, she left already.
Oh...
So she really...
Um... who's going to do the shopping?
We've still got other preparations to make...
I'll do everything myself.
Bye.
Something happen?
N-No, nothing really...
Have we ever had omelet rice on the menu here?
What? Omelet rice?
Not as far as I know.
Do you know how to make it?
Actually, I've never tried.
Ever since I was a kid, my family has
always eaten traditional Japanese food.
Oh, so even you haven't...
You wanna eat one that badly?
N-No, that's not...
I'm off now.
What? Hey!
What an oddball.
Thank you for traveling with us this morning.
This train is bound for...
So, about the omelet rice... So, about the omelet rice...
What is it, Nakochi?
You go first.
Nothing, really...
Why omelet rice? Why omelet rice?
Hey... Hey...
We've finished cleaning this area.
Is there anything else that needs to be done?
Oh, I'm fine.
If you're free, could one of you clean the entrance please?
I'll take care of that.
Thanks.
I'll help you clean the room where the customers just finished their meal.
Oh...
Well, thank you.
Morning!
Morning.
I figured you'd be here prepping by yourself.
What do you want?
Well... I'd like to help you.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Besides, isn't the service team supposed to meet up in the afternoon?
I told you, I came in early, just to help you.
I told you, I don't need your help.
You're so difficult, Minchi.
Don't make me repeat myself!
Have all of today's customers left?
Yes, the group that just left was the last of them.
How are the two helpers?
They're both wonderful!
Especially their long, slender legs...
Incredible!
They're not geisha.
They're very experienced.
They're a great help.
Although they're on emergency duty, it's still a part of their job.
Oh, but the Kobayashis, who frequently stay with us,
were sad that Ohana and Nako weren't on duty today.
Ah, so there are customers who say such things.
Well, Ohana's almost worked here for 6 months.
It feels like she just arrived yesterday.
How is it? Is this good?
The left side's a little too high.
Got it.
Yup, right about there.
Okay.
Hey... maybe I should apologize to Tsurugi.
You didn't do anything wrong, Yuki!
Yeah! Tsurugi's the one who should be feeling bad.
Yeah, but...
Don't worry! Tsurugi will apologize for sure.
Yeah. You wanna make omelet rice, right?
Yeah.
Something bothering you?
No...
I've had the feeling that something's been bothering you
since this morning, Oshimizu.
Sorry...
It's just that someone, who works at the same inn as me,
is having some problems with her class.
Go and help her out.
But I'm part of this class's committee.
That's why you've been helping me, right?
I can finish the rest by myself.
But...
She's your friend, right?
Go, be there for her.
Okay.
Thanks.
Oshimizu!
Oh, Yuina.
Your classroom's in the other direction, right?
Don't tell me. You're worried about Princess Minko, right?
I was wondering if there was anything I could do to help.
Kissuiso's really amazing!
Great teamwork!
It's nothing like that...
But I'd love for someone as cute as you to be a part
of the service team!
Oh, why don't we trade you for her?
Her? Who are you...
No, you can't!
Ah, a her was all you needed to understand, eh?
How many do we need to chop?
I never asked for your help!
Stubborn mule!
Balut!
Hey, Ohana?
Aren't you a part of our team?
I was worried about Minchi...
You don't need to worry!
That's not what I meant.
Aren't other people supposed to be helping Princess Minko?
Umm...
I said I'd do everything myself.
Minchi...
Umm...
Why don't we all have lunch now?
Oh yeah, it's about lunchtime now.
Good idea!
You're right, I'm hungry.
What about you, Minchi?
I'm not-
I had forgotten that I'm hungry! It's all your fault!
What?!
Why is it my fault?!
Because you're doing unnecessary things!
Let's all have lunch together then.
The cafeteria's closed today, though.
Am not!
Well, there are a lot of ingredients here,
Are too!
Stop being so stubborn, Minchi!
and it looks like the rice is already cooked, so...
I can do it myself!
You can't!
Is it okay, Minchi?
Yeah.
Okay, maybe we should test out tomorrow's menu.
Or is there anything you lot want to eat?
Umm...
Yes, Nakochi?
I'd like to eat omelet rice.
What?
What?
Omelet rice?
Uhh...
Huh?
Home Economics Room
Are we allowed to just come and use this room?
I was planning on using it this afternoon for prepping, anyway.
I've already got permission.
Well-prepared!
I should have high expectations of a lunch
made by Princess Minko, right?
You're really going to make omelet rice?
That's what Nako wants to eat, right?
I assumed you didn't like omelet rice, Tsurugi.
I assumed you didn't know how to make it.
What?
I said it was impossible to
make it with the equipment we have in the classroom.
You're really experienced at this.
It feels like I'm watching a cook.
When I was a child,
I went to the city with my mother
once a month to shop,
and I always had omelet rice on that day
at a food place called Grill Sakae on the
6th floor of a department store.
I know that place!
Yeah, I think it's pretty famous.
Wow.
I think the Milano-style cutlet tastes better there, though.
I always liked to sit at the counter since you could see them cooking.
I kept watching the kitchen as my meal was being made.
I watched it being made, and then ate it.
Even after I finished eating, I continued to watch the kitchen.
The kitchen on the other side of the counter seemed
like a magical world to me as a kid.
I've seen this at a restaurant before!
Yeah!
Here.
Thanks.
I'll make you all some.
Wow, this is so good!
Hey, Minchi?
Did you decide to pursue a career in cooking because
you liked the omelet rice at that shop?
N-Not at all.
Then why did you decide to be a cook?
Shut up.
Oh, you're right!
You can't make this using the hot plate in the classroom.
Oh, right. There's not enough heat.
Time to dig in!
Hey, Minchi?
Is it okay if we make your portion of omelet rice?
How come?
I know we can't make this type of
omelet rice in the classroom,
but I wanted to try a different type.
A different type?
Like ketchup rice?
Yeah!
All you have to do is mix the ketchup and rice like this.
My little brother loves ketchup,
and my mom scolds him every time he makes something like this.
It definitely looks like chicken rice!
It tastes pretty good too.
Should we really be serving something like that to our customers?
We could possibly make chicken pilaf instead.
Pilaf?
Yeah.
You can cook it using the rice cooker.
It'll even keep it warm.
That's it!
I heard that there's a maid cafe in Tokyo that does that.
Tokyo...
Okay.
Now we just need some eggs.
Oh, I can do that.
The chicken pilaf's ready.
Wow, you're good at this too.
My mother would sometimes come home late
at night and demand omelet rice.
Okay, done!
Wow!
There! Our style of omelet rice.
How is it?
Here's some ketchup.
Did you have to write that?
Yup!
Okay, eat up!
Well, how is it?
It's good.
This is also omelet rice, right?
Okay, let's add it to tomorrow's menu!
What do you say, leader of the cooking team?
We'll lend you a hand if anything arises.
I'll think about it.
Thanks!
Great!
I think this is going to be a lot different...
Is it harder than you initially thought?
I'll try it again.
Here, Ohana!
I ate the last one, so I'm still pretty full...
You said you'd lend me a hand!
Fine...
There.
I think I can do this now.
Once more.
That's awesome, Minchi!
I knew you could do it!
Here.
I need to eat this one as well?!
I appreciate it.
I'll do my best...
Oh, I want to try too!
What?!
I hear Minko uses a portion of her pay every month
to buy ingredients she usually doesn't have access to
in order to practice.
At her age, I'm sure she has other things she'd like to buy.
She's really something else.
She'd already decided that she wanted to be a chef in middle school,
and came to our inn as soon as she graduated.
It's crazy to think that
she's already set herself a goal at such a young age.
But you know, not everyone is like her.
There are those who can decide on their path right away,
and there are also those who can
only see their path after climbing high.
You can take a detour or accidentally take the wrong path.
Those girls are allowed to do that.
I think we're just about done.
So are we.
Now all that's left is to wait for tomorrow!
It's going to be packed with customers tomorrow!
I can't wait!
Hey, you're back.
What are you doing, Mizuno?
There's an area that needs a painting placed in it.
I miscalculated.
I need to hurry.
What are you drawing?
Oshimizu.
What? Me?
I've been with you for so long that
I don't need you to be here to draw you.
Mind if I take a look?
Go ahead.
Oshimizu!
I made it in time...
Is your class ready too?
Yeah, somehow.
You look happy, Nakochi.
I do?
Oh? Did something nice happen?
Nope, nothing.
Are you sure?
Kourin Festival
where traditional maids are at your service!
Princess Cafe
What's the menu like?
Everything on it is delicious!
How do I look?!
Really cute!
Thanks for waiting.
Did you make this?
She really showed us.
I hate myself for suggesting to add that dish to the menu.
Is this the place?
Oh!
Yo, I'm here.
Thank you!
This is our menu.
Okay.
Wow, this menu is really Minko-like.
I'll have the omelet rice.
What? What?
What? Did I say something wrong?
N-No, one order of Our Style of Omelet Rice!
Okay! One order of Our Style of Omelet Rice!
The omelet rice is done!
Okay!
M-Minchi?
Don't say it...
Thanks for waiting!
Here is a special omelet rice filled with love from our chef.
What?
Oh, I see.
It's like I'm watching a teen drama.
The campfire is about to be lit.
Want to go down there, Mizuno?
Up to you.
Sorry we're late!
It's because you took forever to get dressed!
What?
Sorry we're late, Nakochi.
Don't worry about it. Thanks for coming.
Listen to this! Tohru visited our cafe.
And Minchi...
Shut up, you balut!
Hey, it's lit!
Hey, let's go!
Yeah, let's.
Then, it's settled!
Let's go together, okay?
Man, you were so amazing today, Minchi!
Yeah...
What do you mean?
Yeah, you really did your best today!
What the heck do you mean?
Not only L-O-V-E, but...
She gave it to me.
Isn't it pretty?
What are you guys talking about?
Friend
Well, Minchi drew this huge heart!
Shut up!
Now, there's no need to be embarrassed.
I'm not!
It's like I'm watching some teen drama.
What?! Getting married?!
S-So early?!
I like kids.
Tohru likes me?
It's kinda erotic!
Love saves the world!
