Late Night Show
Bones 10th anniversary project
A healthy soul...
With the threat of the Demon Blade turning into a Kishin,
Black Star and Tsubaki-chan went to the Shin village.
The Demon Blade possesses its owners, even controlling their shadows.
And, in the end, it eats their souls.
For the two who had obtained a total of zero souls,
Tsubaki.
Big brother.
Only she can stop the Demon Blade.
This is a free fansub. Not for sale or rent.
Last week's Late Show had omitted something, hadn't it?
We've received this postcard rebuking us for this.
And so, this week, a Special Drama...
It's my new production!!
Its title is... that fun will be in the end.
You went inside the Demon Blade, Tsubaki?
Ryoku.
You've been done in.
How terrible...
Because of that member of the Hoshizoku, Ryoku has...
It's terrible...
Get out of this village!
Tsubaki...
Are you ignoring me?
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!
Leave! Leave!
Leave! Leave!
Leave!!
You better come back...
The camellia flower

What Lies Beyond The Sadness?
Powerless...
What's wrong, Tsubaki?
Don't tell me you came this far just to fool around...
You're just as your name states...
Quietly blooming without being payed attention to...
It also whithers in a miserable way and leaves an unpleasant feeling.
A half-assed flower...
I doth think.
Should this be the outside world, you would've already died...
Your soul is shaking...
Are you scared... of dying?
Are you scared... of dying?
I'll stop you even if I die.
I will...
Stop it!
Those eyes...
You drove me this way!
You drove me...
Leave!
Leave! Leave!
Leave! Leave!
You damned Hoshizoku!
Leave!
Black Star's consideration is amazing, isn't it?
To think the Demon Blade and Tsubaki were siblings...
But Black Star doesn't know about it yet, right?
Yup...
Tsubaki's not moving... is she alright?
What's going on inside the Demon Blade?
Hmm, well, about that...
Oi?
While having lunch
We've brought drinks!
Hey wait, how serious are you about this?
Well, let's see...
In simple terms, there's a tug of war with her and the Demon Blade Masamune's souls.
On one hand, the Demon Blade is trying to take over her soul with his Soul Possession skill.
On the other hand, Tsubaki's trying to absorb him.
To take the mummy or to become one...
Still, does Tsubaki stand a chance?
It'll be tough... for her.
It'll be tough... for her.
They're fighting inside him, so he has the upper hand in the tug of war of souls.
The probability of Tsubaki winning is low.
A fight to the death between siblings...
I can't even imagine my life without Patty!
There, there...
The path to becoming a Kishin is chosen by weakness of heart.
The Kishin sought power to escape the fear from death.
Why does the Demon Blade Masamune seek power?
How did he end up on this path?
Shuriken, Smoke Bomb, Dummy Star, Ninja Blade...
Shuriken, Smoke Bomb, Dummy Star, Ninja Blade...
Shuriken, Smoke Bomb, Dummy Star, Ninja Blade...
Shuriken, Smoke Bomb, Dummy Star, Ninja Blade...
Why do you only use the Chain-Scythe?
Are you holding back on me?
Nay!
Is it compassion?
The Nakatsukasa, who raised both Demon Blade Masamune and Tsubaki,
Masamune, as the eldest son, was supposed to inherit his ancestors' power.
However...
You inherited all the other powers...
What I inherited... was nothing but the Japanese sword.
What I inherited... was nothing but the Japanese sword.
For some reason, Tsubaki ended up with all the powers.
I was raised in an overprotective environment.
I didn't know...
The one who taught me that...
Don't look at me with those eyes...
Don't pity me!
You've always tucked away your feelings and never looked out for me.
I hated that.
Tsubaki,
And... I will master the way of the sword!
And... I will master the way of the sword!
Puppet Rain.
Black... Star...
Tsubaki...
Do you remember my big on-stage performance...
I remember!
All of you, remember this!
I am Black Star!
I will surpass God!
What?
Idiot.
Has he got a fever?
No! I've already caught up with him!
Don't be sorry, commoners!
I am just too awesome!
Heaven' s Wrath
I' m the superior ruler
Heaven's Wrath! I'm the superior ruler!
Heaven's Wrath! I'm the superior ruler!
Tomorrow, a halo shall appear over me!
Silence...
Silence...
Huh... It seems I'm ahead of this era.
Huh... It seems I'm ahead of this era.
Uhm...
I-It was nice.
Oh?
You're the first one to recognize my great talent.
Congratulations.
Your name?
Yes.
Tsubaki.
I'm a weapon.
I'm Black Star!
A Technician.
That time...
This time I'll be watching yours.
This woman hasn't moved for a while...
You should also get out of this village!
Oi, brat!
If you mess with Tsubaki's stage,
Shut it and look over there.
Shut up, Hoshizoku!
Is there anything left for you?
In the end, you're just a scentless flower...
Will you remain silent until the very end?
Tsubaki, what do you want to play?
What about you, brother?
Geez, Tsubaki...
I'd like to play what you want.
Then...
I want to play Kemari.
Your soul...
Fighting the Demon Blade alone...
It's reckless!
It's true that Tsubaki's a powerful transmutative weapon...
However, the opponent is too strong for her.
As I thought, I should've gone instead.
She's not alone.
Isn't he there? Black Star.
Isn't he there? Black Star.
Tsubaki's fighting because he's there.
Yup!
What's really important is right here.
Tsubaki-chan may have transmutative powers and be a very special weapon,
Tsubaki, pay attention and pick it up, this time.
Okay.
There!
Did you really want to play Kemari?
Yes.
Actually, I wanted to play house.
If I said it, would we have stayed together playing all this time?
I am Tsubaki...
I am scentless...
What do you want to say?
Do you pity me? Scorn me?
Do you pity me? Scorn me?
I bet it feels good...
You remain silent, but you get excited just looking at people.
Can you deny that?
You don't think that way...
No!
No!
No! No! No!
No! No! No!
No! No! No!
No!
I won't hold back anymore.
I will stop you, big brother.
Please, feel it with your soul, big brother.
The real me.
Nonsense!
Just like that?
You're just a half-assed flower, in the end!
You're wrong!
I won't let you say things like half-assed.
There's someone who taught me better!
Even Tsubaki...
Even for a camellia flower...
Tsubaki!
Tsubaki went inside the Demon Blade?
You're kidding, right?
Tsubaki has...
Tsubaki-chan!
It's no good, I can't bear to watch.
Geezer, lend me that stick!
Oi, Tsubaki!
Come out, dammit!
Don't you lose!
Your stage isn't like this, right?
Encore!
Encore!
Encore! Encore!
Encore! Encore!
Your feelings...
Camellia flower.
The scentless flower?
Nay!
I saw your trembling soul.
Big brother...
It has a nice scent...
Big brother...
Encore!
Encore!
Encore!
Encore! Encore!
Encore! Encore!
Encore! Encore!
Encore! Encore!
Ouch!
I'm back, Black Star.
Tsubaki...
I've met my brother.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Are you really okay?
Yes. I'm fine.
C'mon, get over here!
C'mon, get over here!
Black Star will give you a hug!
I'm sorry!
Black Star, you're bleeding!
Are you alright?
Don't worry about me.
You...
Lil' boy!
Ryoku!
You're still alive... good for you.
You're still alive... good for you.
Hoshizoku are the worst!
Aren't you satisfied?
Get lost!
The losers from this village are so persistent and annoying!
Shut yer trap!
You're even scared of an imaginary enemy...
Lame!
I couldn't care less about the past!
I'm a star because I always move forward!
Stop joking around!
Get lost!
Don't come again!
If only you hadn't been born...
Crap!
Who'd want to come to this lame village?
You idiots!
I'm so sorry!
He's a good boy, really!
He's not a Hoshizoku, but I still don't like him...
Hey, Tsubaki...
You've defeated the Demon Blade and made amends with your past, but...
Huh?
Yes!
Aye!
You guys...
I've made you worry...
Yo! Nice job!
You two were great!
You finally got a soul.
For a repeat student, you've changed, haven't you?
You kept us waiting for quite a while.
I told you, I'm an era ahead!
You did it, Tsubaki-chan!
This one was crying.
That was you, sis.
Shinigami-sama,
That's because they're all still growing youngsters, you see...
Attention, everyone!
I'm going to show all of you something awesome!
When did he...
When did he...
Oi?
Would you believe it, Tsubaki's attained a new mode!
Let's go, Tsubaki!
Yes!
Demon Blade mode!
Black Star!
My soul's wavelength suddenly got drained...
It seems Black Star can't use it yet.
But I was surprised!
She earned her brother's power, too.
Uh uh...
I guess I was born ahead of my time...
This age is already behind me...
Let's take our time moving forward.
Together.
