Autumn, it is the season for maidens.
That goes for earthworms, mole crickets,
pond skaters, and even Rei.
Everyone! Everyone falls in love!
Anyone who gets in the way of human love, or rather, animal love...
In the name of SPCA, Sailor Moon will punish you!
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward, I can say it in my dreams
My thoughts are about to short circuit, I want to see you right now
Moonlight that makes me want to cry, midnight that keeps me from calling
Because I'm so innocent, what should I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope
Guided by the light of the moon
We will meet again and again
I count the sparkle of constellations to foretell the future of my love
We were born in the same land, miracle romance
I believe in it, miracle romance
I'm Usagi Tsukino.
As you know, I'm a sailor warrior of love and justice, Sailor Moon.
But it's not easy, you know.
I have to get a hold of the legendary Silver Crystal
before the bad guys get it,
but to do that, I have to find the seven rainbow crystals!
Oh, man. But anyhow, we've got four sailor warriors now,
so it'll work out somehow.
Loved and Chased! Luna's Worst Day Ever
No need for Heaven and Earth
Rhett Butler!
Rhett Butler!
I was so worried about you!
He definitely doesn't look like a Rhett Butler.
Well, well...
So, this little girl possesses a rainbow crystal?
The seventh rainbow crystal should be easy to obtain.
You certainly got dragged into a terrible mess.
No kidding.
I've got nothing to do with turf wars among stray cats.
Hi there!
Thanks for waiting.
Oh? Where's Rei?
What? Oh, well...
She said she wanted to go on a date because it's Sunday.
What?!
Hello, this is Chiba.
Hello? It's Rei!
I am not at home right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Oh, no... Please leave a message after the beep.
Oh, hello? This is Rei.
Well, actually I found a very unusual cake at a certain shop,
and I was wondering if you'd want to try it with me.
The cake is called tiramisu.
I might not look it, and I don't mean to brag,
The seventh rainbow crystal... I might not look it, and I don't mean to brag,
The seventh rainbow crystal... but I'm very hip and know what's new.
But I'm very hip and know what's new.
I will get it no matter what. Oh, what am I saying? I'm just so nervous.
Oh, what am I saying? I'm just so nervous.
What in the world are you doing?
I'm looking for the seventh rainbow crystal.
What? The Crescent Moon Wand hasn't responded at all.
That's why we're using the computer to narrow down
where the seventh crystal might be.
We finally got the data to do that.
Really!
Luna! Really!
Luna! Oh!
Oh!
The data input has finished.
This is where the seventh rainbow crystal must be.
What?
So, the rainbow crystal is somewhere near that house?
Yes, it should be.
Oh, I didn't know that cat lived at this house.
Okay, let's go.
Oh, I'll just wait here.
What's wrong?
Well... What's wrong?
Well...
Luna, this is an important mission!
You should be more aware of that!
Excuse me. I am not that ugly.
Ugly...
Oh, it doesn't really matter.
I'm sure even Luna has days when she doesn't feel up to it.
Oh, fine, meow.
Then, wait there for a bit, okay?
Don't go anywhere!
Yes, Ma'am.
Honestly! Usagi takes every opportunity she can...
Oh, no!
Tadahisa Kohara Mimi Anna
Yes?
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you. Is your mother or father home? Yes?
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you. Is your mother or father home?
Both of them won't be home until the evening.
The Wand is responding.
That little girl is a monster?
Oh, no, you can't!
Come back, Rhett Butler!
Rhett Butler?
Under Construction
Now, time to take the rainbow crystal.
Why?! Why isn't the rainbow crystal appearing?!
Shoot!
So, that ugly cat is the monster!
I cannot believe I missed that!
The final great Monster wasn't reborn as a human!
That's as far as you go!
Now that we're here, we won't let you have your way!
We won't let such an innocent young girl become a monster!
In the name of the moon, I will punish you!
Quiet!
Zoi!
Bubble...
Sailor Moon, you're in my way!
What do you want me to do?
I changed my mind.
I'm too busy to play with you guys.
You're not getting away!
Supreme...
Wait a minute!
We'll all be electrocuted!
What is this rotten smell?
Is that ugly cat really somewhere around here?
This is why I hate monsters that aren't human.
Oh, no!
This may be the toughest ordeal I have ever faced!
But where has Luna gone?
Yeah! She's so undependable!
Where in the world is she goofing off at this critical time?!
Knowing Luna, I'm sure that's not it.
Maybe something's happened to her.
Oh!
There's a cartridge of the Sailor V game over here!
Usagi...
Right when Zoisite could be back any moment to attack us.
But I can't believe such a little girl has a rainbow crystal.
We absolutely cannot let this girl turn into a monster.
It's close. It's getting close.
That ugly cat is very close by.
It's warm...
It's a horde of rats!
Jubancho Shopping District
Oh, where could Mamoru have gone?
It's such a nice Sunday, too.
Miss Rei!
Yuichiro!
Japanese Boy I Am Beautiful Yuichiro!
Japanese Boy I Am Beautiful Oh, that's right. You're off today, too, aren't you?
Oh, that's right. You're off today, too, aren't you?
Yes, but I have nothing to do.
Now's Your Chance! Yes, but I have nothing to do.
Now's Your Chance! How about going for tea or something together?
How about going for tea or something together?
Autumn Fragrance How about going for tea or something together?
Autumn Fragrance What?!
Autumn Fragrance Oh, well, I don't know.
Autumn Fragrance
You're Going To Take That?!
You're Going To Take That?! What was I thinking?
You're Going To Take That?! Of course, a wonderful girl like you
You're Going To Take That?! Wouldn't have lots of spare time on her hands.
Wouldn't have lots of spare time on her hands.
Well, something like that.
I understand. Well, I'll be going then.
Oh, excuse me...
What was that? He's so restless.
It's like Gone with the Wind.
There's no exit anywhere!
Today is not my lucky day! It's all because you...
What's this? You hurt your leg.
Did you hurt yourself while you were saving me?
You went through all that just to save me?
Do you have a crush on me or something?
Hey, now...
That's...
Zoisite!
I've found you! The seventh great Monster!
What?! You have one of the rainbow crystals?!
Hurry! He won't be able to follow us in here!
You're not getting away from me!
What is that?!
The rainbow crystal is mine!
Oh, no! Run faster!
It's the exit!
I should've gone on a date with Yuichiro.
It's Luna.
With her boyfriend, I see. Well, great for her.
Gag! What the hell is that?!
Oh! The Crescent Moon Wand isn't responding!
Why didn't I notice this earlier?
That means this girl isn't involved.
Then, why was it responding earlier?
Could it be...
That's right! It was responding to that cat!
It's game over!
Run faster!
Turn a misfortune into a blessing.
Hi. All's well that ends well, I guess.
Fire Soul!
I'm a sailor warrior of love and justice, Sailor Mars!
I have arrived!
I won't let you interfere with their love!
Even if they're cats, love is still love!
No!
The fire of passion is burning! The fire of justice is burning!
Anybody who gets in the way of love,
or rather, the love between beasts...
In the name of Mars, Sailor Mars will chastise you!
You're such a dummy.
Zoi!
Consider the situation before you start posing!
This time, I will be sure to take the rainbow crystal!
Rhett Butler!
Rhett Butler!
Now, finish them off, great Monster!
There aren't so many of them today,
so it should be an easy victory!
Oh, ouch!
The last rainbow crystal is mine. Good-bye.
Damn you, Tuxedo Mask! Stop right there!
I said, stop!
Oh, no, it's heading towards the town!
No!
Luna! No!
Luna!
No, no, no, no! No! Please stay there!
I'll get you back to the way you were soon, I promise!
Luna!
Rhett Butler...
Don't worry.
Usagi will restore you to the way you were.
So, they are lovers, just as I thought.
Bubble
Spray!
No! How could she ruin the mood?!
Sailor Jupiter!
Thank you for waiting!
What were you doing?! You're late!
I'm sorry, it's because I wasn't paying attention.
Oh, it has nothing to do with the fact
that Usagi was playing a video game!
That's right! It wasn't Usagi's fault at all!
Oh, boy. You're not helping at all.
Hey, this is no time for stand-up comedy!
Oh, right. Okay!
Moon Healing Escalation!
Refresh!
Good grief.
I was so worried about you, Rhett Butler!
She looks so happy. I was so worried about you, Rhett Butler!
She looks so happy.
Luna, are you sure you don't need to say good-bye to your boyfriend?
What?! Luna has hooked up with that cat?!
Don't be ridiculous!
Woohoo! You go, Luna!
Honestly! Not you, too, Usagi.
Don't just make things up, okay?
Hey, now...
During the day, the fragrance of flowers
During the night, the twinkle of the stars
It's a world no one knows about
With white shoes clicking
Cross the white moon bridge
And there lives a princess, dreaming of a sweet kiss
Offer a prayer to the moon
It will surely bring you happiness
Go round and round, the moon's merry-go-round
Make that serene dress made of glass flutter in the wind
She's always watching over us
Moon, moon princess
