Yawata Studio
I'm Konaka, the producer.
It's nice to meet you all.
Likewise.
This is Hattori, from the Weekly Shounen Jack editing department.
I'm Hattori Akira.
I'm here today to represent Ashirogi Mutou, the authors of the original work.
Please do a good job with the Reversi anime.
We'll do our best.
Now then, let's introduce the cast.

Beyond each of my dreams lies yet another dream
Dreams and Reality
All right! That's it for today.
Good work.
The anime's starting tomorrow, right?
Yeah.
Itll be an emotional moment for me.
I was with Ashirogi for only three years, but we went through a lot of things together.
Miura.
By the way, they haven't gone to a recording session or anything, have they?
Yeah. They don't want to do anything like that until the show actually airs.
It's just like Mashiro to do that.
He's stubborn, you might say.
Nah, Azuki's a handful as well.
Though she may seem meek on the outside.
I see.
So they're birds of a feather, then.
Only 19 more hours!
I'll be so jittery until then!
You already saw it at the private showing.
It's the TV broadcast I'm nervous about!
Mashiro, you're nervous too, right?
Huh?
Y-Yeah.
Saikou's nervous in a different way, right?
What do you mean?
That's...
Come on! Is it a secret?
After Reversi's anime is broadcast tomorrow, I'm going to go see Azuki.
What?! Miho never said anything about that!
Oh, so that's why the assistants are off tomorrow.
Yes.
And come tomorrow,
I'll officially propose to her.
Propose!
But her response is 100 guaranteed to be yes already,
so there's really no reason for you to be nervous.
That's not true.
The dream that they encouraged each other to pursue, never meeting face-to-face, has finally been achieved.
So going to see her is a big deal, you know?
That's why he's going to propose to her then.
There's no way he wouldn't be nervous.
I see.
So it'll be like the most important day in Mashiro Moritaka's life, right?
Yeah.
Just a yeah?
What's up with you today?
You seem very up-front about this.
It's because I'm thankful to you.
Thankful?
Huh? What's this?
I'd like to shake your hand.
Shake my hand? Are you trying to grab the hand of a married woman?
Kaya, I've been thinking of telling you this one day, and it seems like now's the time.

Thank you.
I think Azuki must feel the same way.
So even I was of some use!
What are you talking about?!
You did all the housework here and even helped us out with our work sometimes!
Stop praising me so much!
And besides, Mashiro, Akito and Miho made me happy!
I should be the one thanking you!
Get it together, Saikou.
I'm...
going home.
You two must have some guy things you'd like to talk about.
Later.
What's with her?
We don't even have any guy things to talk about anyway.
Yeah.
We'll just keep going on as we are.
As Ashirogi Mutou!
Yeah.
Mom.
Yes?
The Reversi anime will begin tomorrow.
I know.
Let's watch it together.
That's not it.
When the anime airs, Mashiro will come to see me.
What?! He's going to ask for us to give you away?
Oh my! I haven't even prepared anything!
Th-That's not it!
If that were the case, then he would have told you beforehand.
And Dad as well.
Y-You're right.
Then I suppose it's for a date.
It's your first date, isn't it?
That's right.
You promised each other that you'd get married if you each achieved your dreams,
and tried your best without even seeing each other.
I'm very happy for you.
Is it really that interesting?
Huh?
So when were you going to tell me that you're the number one author in Jack?
Actually, right now I don't have a weekly series.
So you cant really say that my current number one” status is the real thing.
I see.
I'll wait a little longer, then.
Come and tell me when you get there.
Yeah.
Gotta become a first-class
manga artist as soon as possible!
Uncle...
What you wanted to do, what you couldn't do...
I'll make it all a reality.
I bought some tonkotsu ramen!
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thou shalt not enter without warning. Thou shalt knock first!
Hey, you seem kinda down.
We just got news that GIRI is 2nd in the early rankings.
Oh, that's great, isn't it?
It's not good at all.
There's too much of a gap between us and Zombie Gun in 1st.
On the other hand, the gap between GIRI in 2nd and +NATURAL in 5th is practically nil.
At this rate, we're just here to make Niizuma look good.
Zombie Gun is really something.
It's been in first place the entire time since Reversi ended!
It was such a shame about Reversi.
I mean, the anime just started today.
For sure.
Enough whining already!
We're going to change Jack.
Master Niizuma and Ashirogi have come up with one way of doing it.
What would it look like if I didn't follow up with my own?
You're in 8th in the early rankings this week.
I see.
Don't you think you've been lacking your usual negativity lately?
Well, of course I am.
That's because I've never been happier!
He's losing his energy source.
Yoshida.
What happened to my Become a Super Manga Artist plan?
I've already lost ten kilos.
Right! I've been thinking about it, of course!
I thought it's about time we entered the plan's second stage.
Oh, the second stage?
This is bad.
Never mind the plan; I forgot he even existed.
Well then, Yuri and I are going to plan our wedding while we watch Ashirogi's anime!
For now, just drop another 40 kilos.
You'll probably be number one in the final ranking at this rate.
That'll make it 30 weeks in a row!
Is that so?
What's wrong? Can't get excited without Ashirogi around?
No, I am excited.
Until Ashirogi returns, I won't lose to anybody.
Their anime will start soon.
What will you do?
I want to see the moment their dreams come true.
I'm home!
It hasn't started yet, has it?
No.
Thank goodness.
Go get changed.
But I won't make it in time!
It'll be fine. Go on.
Jeez.
If I miss the beginning, it'll be your fault, Mom!
Soon...
My dream with Mashiro will be fulfilled soon.
The dream from our third year of middle school.
Must we?
Yes.
Even though we have the same goal...
Our ways of thinking are just too different.
We just can't get around it.
It's a shame.
See you, Weiss.
Yeah, Schwarz.
Lets begin the game that will destroy humanity!

The opening looks cool!
Yeah!
In three years, they'll surpass Niizuma Eiji.
Yes.
So you're watching it here?
Don't want to make the other editors uncomfortable?
You could say that, yes.
I'll let you be.
Sasaki!
I think Kawaguchi would be happy.
You're right.
Was that a dream?
I will change the world?
Not just anyone can do that.
This world where people can't even follow rules...
There's no way I can change it.
Good morning, Satoru.
Good morning.
There are some parts of yesterday's math homework that I don't understand.
It came true.
My and Mashiro's dream!
You're hopeless.
A demerit system?
From now on, each student will be allotted 20 points,
and with each violation of the rules,
points will be deducted according to the severity of the transgression.
You cannot recover points.
And if your points fall to zero, you will be expelled.
P-Principal...
No objection.
It is obvious that one should follow the rules. I see no problem with this.
N-Not you too, Mr. Gotou?!
I agree as well.
If you don't like it, you can quit.
Yamada, you're the the student council president!
I also agree.
Wonderful.
If I have this kind of power, then changing the world isn't impossible anymore!
If that's true,
then I can't pass it up.
All right, Weiss.
I'll make a contract with you.

Their dream really came true.
All that's left now is for him to propose.
I-I'm nervous all of a sudden now.
It's over!
It was good, wasn't it, Sis?
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes, this is Miho.
I'm in front of your house right now.
Okay. I'll be right out.
Why are you so flustered?
It's not like you.
Miho?
What?
You're very pretty today. Do your best.
Oh, I get it.
I'm off.
That's an amazing car.
Yeah.
It doesn't really suit you, though.
Yeah, I know.
But it's fine this way.
Once I become a first-rate manga artist,
I'm going to propose to Haruno.
and I'll propose!
That's right!
And I'll come pick her up in a high-class foreign ca
No seat is too good for Haruno. When I propose, we'll go to that
Right! And I'll come pick her up in a high-class foreign car while I'm at it!
Thanks.
I'll make sure she sits next to me in style.
The happiest time of my life was in middle school
when Haruno and I were seated next to each other.
It's mysterious.
Seeing you makes my heart beat fast, but I'm still calm.
Yeah.
It just feels so right to have you sitting next to me.
It feels peaceful.
During middle school, I was at my happiest when my desk was lined up with yours.
I-I felt the same way, too.
Whenever you sat next to me, I mean.
In class...
In the hospital...
Or even on the train.
You were always on my right side.
I'm going to propose to Haruno and create that space with her again.
That's why you came in a foreign car...
This was actually one of my uncle'sone of Kawaguchi Tarou's dreams.
He wrote in his diary that he'd come visit the girl he loved in a high-class foreign car.
He didn't get to do it, though.
So I wanted to fulfill that dream for him, no matter what.
That's why...
It worked out perfectly that the driver's side is on the left.
So that you could be on my right.
Worked out perfectly?
That's just like you, Mashiro.
A-Azuki!
Y-Yes?!
Um...
We'll be moving, so please put on your seatbelt.
Okay!
The girl that Mashiro's uncle wanted to visit was probably...
But their relationship never got past an exchange of letters.
We have...
If we go to a place that holds memories for us,
then I'm sure that the right words of the proposal will come naturally.
Honest words for honest people like us.
My house...
Is this house still yours?
Yes.
My mom likes it, and keeps talking about moving back here one day.
I see.
Mashiro, why did you bring us here?
This is the place where we first spoke to each other.
Yes.
I'll draw the art, and he'll write the story.
That's great! I know you can do it!
The second time we spoke to each other was also here.
It was the day we graduated.
Yes.
I'll always be waiting.
It's a place filled with memories for us.
Um...!

Crap...
This is the same situation I was in on our graduation day!
That day, I just stood there and couldn't say anything!
I'm 24 years old already!
I'm not a middle schooler anymore!
Say it! I have to say it!
Um...
W-We...
Yes?
W-We're...
We're just 24...
Y-Yeah.
That's no good! What am I saying?!
Uncle, the right words aren't coming naturally to me!
The right words...
24...
It's been exactly ten years since we first spoke to each other here.
I have to say it.
Now!
I'm glad.
You haven't changed at all, Mashiro.
You're the same as you were ten years ago.
Even though you've become an adult, fulfilled your dream,
and almost everything around you kept changing,
you haven't changed one bit, Mashiro.
I'm glad you haven't.
Honest words for honest people like us.
Azuki.
Our dream was for our manga to become an anime, and for you to voice its heroine.
Now that we've made that dream a reality, will you marry me?
Do you remember
our other promise?
I'll be by your side from now on.
Yeah.
Congrats, Hiramaru!
Congrats, Aoki!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
You look good together!
Congrats, Hiramaru!
Yoshida, you're crying too much.
I'm so jealous, Hiramaru.
Everyone...
Hiramaru.
Let's be happy together,
Kazu.
Yes, Yuri!
I'm talking about a new manga that's even better than +NATURAL!
R-Right...
Because you've just taken over,
I expect you to have at least one or two ideas prepared
No.
I have three, four or five new ideas!
Takahama!
It's here!
What is?
An offer to make Seigi no Mikata into a movie!
We'll have to work out all the details, but the higher-ups are listening!
I'll submit this to the serialization committee, then.
Thank you.
I'll do my best to live up to Hattori's standards!
Right.

You too!
PCP has been getting more and more interesting lately.
Really?
Thanks!
Have you gotten used to your new house yet?
Er, no... not quite yet.
Well, that house is too big for just the two of them. It's no wonder they can't relax.
Or...
Do you just have nothing to talk about with your wife?
O-Of course not!

Caution
I'm really glad your dream was fulfilled.
No, not yet.
Making a living off of manga is what makes us manga authors.
Until we can manage that, we're just gamblers.
That's what Kawaguchi Tarou said.
I see.
Then I'll read this new work of yours very carefully.
Please do!
If we get serialized, we'll have your wedding ceremony, right?
If we do, yeah.
My uncle never told me to become a manga artist.
I'm drawing manga because I want to.
A dream isn't something that someone tells you to go for.
It's something you fulfill of your own will.
The Bakuman anime is now over.
Huh? What about your and Azuki's wedding ceremony?
A-As if we'd show that!
Thanks for supporting us until now, everyone.
We'll keep chasing our dreams!
Just watch us!
