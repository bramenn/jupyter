Okay, three minutes are up.
Tastes great!
Kagome, this is really good!
Oh yeah? I'm glad.
Aren't you having some?
Listen you!
How can you eat in a place like this...
the aftermath of a battle?
You suddenly decide you're hungry...
and take everthing out of my backpack!
What's wrong with having a leisurely lunch...
by a pretty stream or a field of flowers?
Oh, you!
You're so uncouth!
I must say, though, Kagome...
your country has many convenient things.
I was shocked at your bicycle.
But a thing that tells time...
and by looking at your strange foodstuffs...
you do much trade with foreigners from the south.
Wow! Myoga, you're very smart.
However, did you know that cup noodle was invented by the Japanese?
It was intended for use up in outer space.
Outer space?
Yes.
Humans go to outer space...
Oh yeah, did you know we even went to the moon!
The moon?
How?!
Using a rocket.
A rocket?
It's huge...
and fire shoots out from the bottom...
and kaboom!
By next time, I'll have studied up on it!
What?! It suddenly got dark.
What's this?!
Master Inuyasha, you mustn't litter!
This is no time to be concerned about that!
You there!
You posses the Sacred Jewel!
What?!
A demon?
No...
That's fox fire!
Fox fire?!
Hand it over!
Or I'll kill you!
Oww!
Huh?
A child?!
What're you doing?! You heathen!
Hey!
You've got a tail!
Yea, I'm a fox!
Huh?! A fox?
How cute!
Let me hold him next!
Why're you lining up behind me?
Huh?! Ajizo statue?
My things!
Here it is! A fragment of the Sacred Jewel!
Ah--! It's mine!
Farewell!
He disappeared!
My name is Shippo.
Why are you after the Sacred Jewel fragment?
To avenge...
To avenge my father!
Avenge?
Was your father killed?
Hmm... So you wanted to gain strength...
by using the Sacred Jewel fragment?
What're you doing?!
Are you listening?!
Huh?
Huh? What's that cloud?
Ready to hunt, Manten?
Yes, Brother Hiten!
Thunderbolt attack!
Witness our power!
They annihilated the enemy in one blow!
Are the beast-monsters our allies?!
Huh? Allies?
Don't make me laugh!
Boy, wasn't that fun, Manten?
It sure was, Brother Hiten.
I have so much power left over.
The power of the Sacred Jewel imbedded in my forehead is real.
I'll say!
So let's keep gathering more and more, Manten!
Yeah!
We'll look high and low for beasts like this fox who possess the Sacred Jewel
and beat'em to death!
Your father possessed a Sacred Jewel fragment?!
Those two go around killing demons who possess fragments.
Those two?
The Thunder Brothers.
Thunder Brothers?
You mean, Hiten and Manten?
I have heard that they are unruly, mean brothers.
So what?
If we defeat them, we'll get several fragments at once!
Don't make me laugh!
You wouldn't be able to take them on!
You're just a half-demon, aren't you?
I can smell the human in you!
Just a half-demon...
you should stay out of demon affairs!
Shippo... That wasn't a nice thing to...
Why you!
Inuyasha!
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
As long as you understand.
In penance...
Hey you!
As long as the charm stays on...
the jizo statue will not move!
Shippo! You're partly to blame, too.
Inuyasha, stop playing around!
I can't get it off!
I don't like to play tricks on women, but...
I need you to sleep for a while!
That hurt!
Tadah!
I'll use this to lure out the Thunder Brothers!
Huh? The Sacred Jewel fragments!
Give them back or I'll get mad!
Kagome!
Peel off the charm first!
Hey!
Hey you!
If only I had a little more hair.
Then I'd be popular like Brother Hiten.
Huh?
He's not coming after me.
Hmm... What's this?
If it ain't the son of that fox I killed!
Y-You!
Your father's fur is sooo warm!
Why you!
How dare you do that to my father... Why!
WHY!!
Hey, those are Sacred Jewel fragments!
You... Those are the fragments of the Sacred Jewel.
Give them to me!
If you don't!
Darn!
I did it.
What?
Hey, you!
Don't move!
I'll hit you right in the brain next!
A monster!
Don't run!
I just asked you to peel off the charm!
Kagome!
My nose hurts!
Don't move!
Shippo, come here. Hurry!
Why you!
Leave the Sacred Jewel fragments! Wait!
He has two fragments in his forehead!
If I aim there, I can bring him down!
Darn, I just grazed him!
Huh? What's wrong?
My hair!
How could you?!
Watch out! Run!
My father was killed by that!
Did I strike them dead?
Kagome, hang on!
Why, it's only a woman!
Huh?
So... pretty!
Kagome!
You helped me, yet I abandoned you and ran away!
D-Damn!
Ohh... It's not working!
Master Inuyasha, I can't peel this charm off.
Damn that punk fox!
Hey!
I'm willing to help you.
But you must promise NOT to hit me.
Hmm? You alone?
Where's Kagome?
Will you promise or not?!
I won't hit you, stupid!
Now listen quietly.
You promised not to hit me!
Oh yeah... One more. Sacred Jewel fragments.
Good. All intact.
Will you pay attention?!
Kagome's been captured by the Thunder Brothers!
This is no time for that!
Huh? Thunder Brothers?
They're the ones that killed your father?
You came across them?
Hmm... You don't look like you avenged his death.
Did you hide and watch Kagome being kidnapped?
Sh-Shut up!
Hurry and rescue her! Isn't she your woman?!
Huh?!
No way!
Hey!
Well, I'll save her...
Huh?
Well, why don't you grovel at my feet?
Then I'll let bygones be bygones.
Why!!
Shippo, just do as he says.
You need to act like an adult now.
Grr... Why must I stoop so low?!
But I can't save her by myself.
Damn!
Please help me!
Get off your knees! Let's go!
Huh?
Awake, are you?
Wh-Where am I?
Y-You intend to eat me?!
No!
The flesh and blood of pretty, young women promote healthy hair.
I'm gonna boil you down into a potion and apply it to my head.
Wh-hhat?!
I'd rather be eaten than put on your head!!
Shhh!
Not so loud!
If Brother Hiten finds you here, he'll really eat you!
Yo, Manten! You're home.
Hmm... You don't look alike at all!
Brother Hiten!
Who's that woman?
She's my prey!
Don't worry, I won't lay claim on her.
I've got a better woman right here!
He seems more human.
Maybe he'll be more receptive.
Hey, Manten.
Did you find a new Sacred Jewel fragment?
Huh?
Errr... That's right.
Hmm?
Sorry, Brother!
I found one, but...
But what?
Don't tell me that you were more interested in a woman...
and failed to get the Sacred Jewel fragment?!
Brother! Sorry!
You're so hopeless!
If you weren't my kid brother...
you wouldn't have enough lives to survive!
Who is he?! He's so frightening!
What?!
That fox tyke has the Sacred Jewel fragments?!
Are you gonna go for them, Brother Hiten?
Of course! Come on!
It's my chance to escape!
Wait!
What're you doing?!
What'm I doing?!
I'm gonna kill you so you can't escape! What else?
I need you to make my hair potion!
Wait! If you kill me, you won't...
Won't what?
Well...
Won't be able to get the Sacred Jewel fragments!
What?!
I got it!
I can handle the stupid one.
The older brother may just go for it.
Do you two know Inuyasha?
He's quite strong.
Strong?
I've heard of'im.
But isn't he just a half-demon?
He's strong!
He's defeated demons from high and low...
and has most of the Sacred Jewel fragments.
- Wha......at?!
Good! He bit it!
Hey! You'd better not be lying!
Humph...
Inuyasha...
is in love with me.
Huh?
If you ask for an exchange...
I'm sure he'll gladly exchange the fragments for me!
Brother Hiten, she's gotta be lying!
I think I'll believe her.
Huh?
Woman!
Take us to this Inuyasha.
However...
If you've been lying, your pretty face will end up black and charred.
He means it... This arrogant oaf!
What's wrong, Shippo? You're screaming your head off.
If you're scared, just go back.
Stupid! I'm going to avenge my father!
You'd better be as strong as you say you are!
The Thunder Brothers have used the Sacred Jewel fragments...
to increase their power!
Whoa!
That makes beating them even more fun!
Still, I'm worried about Kagome!
That woman is fine! She's got a tenacious streak in her.
I hope so...
According to rumors, those two brothers devour pretty girls immediately!
Is that true?!
What'll we do? Does that mean Kagome has already...
Stupid! What's pretty about Kagome?
What?! Are you totally blind?!
Yes, I think she's very pretty, too.
I'll bet she's already been eaten!
It's all my fault!
Pretty woman, short life. What a wise saying.
Inuyasha!
How can you stand there looking so blank?!
Kagome is a beauty! So she may already have been eaten up!
So... Tell me what's pretty about Kagome?
I've been thinking this from before...
but I think your perception of beauty is a little off.
Aghhh! No wonder you look and dress so weird!
I agree... A red outfit is a bit troubling.
I think you should dress with a little more refinement.
Aghh! Shut up!
How did the subject turn to the way I dress?!
Humph, so you thwarted me!
For someone yapping out loud in front of someone's front yard...
you move fast.
You must be the one... Inuyasha the half-demon.
Master Inuyasha, that's the older Thunder Brother, Hiten.
Hey you!
Where's Kagome?!
Relax, I haven't started eating her yet.
Manten!
Yo! Tadah!
Inuyasha!
Kagome!
She's still alive!
By your expression, looks like the woman spoke the truth.
Hand over every fragment of the Sacred Jewel!
If you want to save the woman you love!
The woman I love?
W-wait!
Who said I love her?!
Don't be so embarrassed!
So you WERE lying!
Who'd hand over the precious fragments just for you?!
What?! You intend to abandon me?!
Abandon?!
You make it sound like you and I are an item!
Which is more important?!
Me or the Sacred Jewel fragments?!
If you dare choose the fragments, I'll rip your lips out!
Whatever!
One thing seems true... You have the fragments of the Sacred Jewel.
I'm gonna kill you and take'em all!
Thunderbolt attack!
You've got brute strength, at least.
This is gonna be fun!
Thunder Brothers, huh?
I'm getting tired of you!
Shippo, the fox tyke is seeking revenge.
With Tetsusaiga, Inuyasha should have an easy time...
defeating a Thunder Brother or two.
Hiten has three fragments and Manten has two.
Five Sacred Jewel fragments can be won or lost in this match!
But when the five fragments get into the hands of the enemy...
an even more frightening demon confronts Inuyasha!
Phantom Showdown: The Thunder Brothers vs. Tetsusaiga.
Don't miss it!
