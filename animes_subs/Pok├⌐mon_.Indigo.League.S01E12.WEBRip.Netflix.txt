Pikachu, go!
Pika!
Youll remember in an earlier Pokemon adventure,
our hero Ash achieved his dream of catching a Bulbasaur.
It was a shocking victory!
Go, Poke Ball!
And so Bulbasaur joined the ranks!
Soon Misty, Brock and Ash lost their way, but found a Charmander.
Braving a fierce storm, Ash and his friends came to its rescue.
Abandoned by its trainer, the fire Pokemon recovered its strength
and gained some new friends!
Charmander became Ashs newest Pokemon.
And thats how Ash caught Charmander and Bulbasaur.
Hes pretty pleased with himself as he skips down the road,
singing our favorite theme.
Becoming a Pokemon trainer looks like itll be a snap. Or will it?
Can things continue to go so smoothly? Maybe Ash is too confident.
Hed better keep his eyes glued to the road ahead.
Who knows what pitfalls are waiting to swallow up our young hero?
Ah, what did I tell you? A pitfall.
Here Comes The Squirtle Squad.
No, not another hole!
- Ow! I landed on my head! - Pikachu!
-It must be a prank. -Someone has a bad sense of humor.
Who would play such a rotten trick?
Squirtle, Squirtle, Squirtle...
Who are you?
Whats so funny? We could have been hurt!
Squirtle, Squirtle, Squirtle...
Ah, dangerous practical jokes are nothing to laugh about.
Pikachu!
Squirtle, Squirtle, Squirtle...
Squirtle, this tiny turtle Pokemon
draws its long neck into its shell to launch incredible water attacks
with amazing range and accuracy. The blasts can be quite powerful.
With my very own Squirtle, Gary will never beat me!
Go, Pikachu!
Squirtle!
Squirtle, Squirtle. Squirtle.
-Pika. -Squirtle.
-Pik! -
-Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle... -
Squirtle.
That was sure weird.
Are you guys all right? Has anyone been hurt here?
-Officer Jenny! -Huh? Have we met before?
Your face doesnt look familiar.
We met you back in Viridian City, remember?
Oh, you mean one of the other Jennys, my cousins.
- Cousin? - My cousins are all police officers.
All of us look identical, plus were all named Jenny.
Talk about family resemblance.
At least they remember all their names!
That Pokemon gang calls itself the Squirtle Squad.
-Squirtle Squad? -Ive never heard of a Pokemon gang.
Theyre all Squirtles who were deserted by their Pokemon trainers.
Deserted?
They dont have a trainer,
so they just run wild and play tricks on the whole town.
Its really kind of sad because if theyd had somebody to care about them,
they wouldnt have turned out to be as bad as they are.
Its a real shame.
There! I see them! The little brats. And Pikachus with them.
Do you see a restaurant? Im really starving here.
But no more pizza!
Im sick of pizza every meal!
Youll never eat again if you mess up this mission!
-Can we order Chinese food? -Or maybe some tacos?
- -Am I the only member of this team
who thinks world domination is more important than whats for lunch?
Now, lets focus ourselves on what really matters
and thats how were going to capture Pikachu!
Heh, now my stomach says its time to eat.
-Huh, yes! -Yay, yeah!
Were going to have a picnic!
You guys got a problem?
Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle.
Meowth, whats it saying?
I think it said, give us your food or else!
Youre threatening us? Were Team Rocket. We threaten!
Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle.
-Lets show these little creeps. -Im game.
Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle.
Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle.
Oh, no. Theyre eating all the jelly donuts and eclairs!
Theyre drinking all the lemonade!
This is cruel and unusual!
Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle...
-Those arent Squirtles. Theyre piggles! -Theyre starting on the sandwiches.
Weve got to do something!
Oh, wait! You Squirtles, howd you like to do a little job for us?
There are these three kids with a Pikachu.
Our boss would be most appreciative if you helped us capture them.
Hed make it worth your while.
Squirtle. Squirtle.
What did Squirtle answer?
The Squirtle said, Forget it. We know humans cant be trusted.
So make them trust us!
Hmm, that wont be easy but Ill see what I can do.
Squirtle, both of these humans belong to Meowth!
-Huh, belong to? -Theyll never trust you two.
Youve got liar written all over you. Just let me handle this!
Ugh, oh, you little...
These humans are my pets. I trained them but theyre pretty stupid.
Squirtle.
Dont ever raise your voice to me again, you bad human!
-Bad human! Bad, bad human! -
Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle...
Squirtle.
See, you guys can trust me!
Squirtle. Squirtle.
Meowth, what about us? Untie us too!
-I want a donut! -Be quiet.
We got to keep up this act till the Squirtles trust me
and thats going to a little time!
-I caught something! -Huh?
Squirtle.
-Im soaked. -Me too.
Pik! Pikachu!
Knock it off, Pikachu!
Wet clothes conduct electricity!
Squirtle. Squirtle.
Ive had enough of your pranks, Squirtle! Pikachu, its out of the water now!
Huh?
Oh! Pikachu!
Oh, its a Goldeen! Watch out for its horn!
Pika? Pik!
Goldeen. Goldeen. Goldeen. Goldeen. Goldeen...
Swim to shore, Pikachu. Hurry up!
Faster! Faster!
Pikachu!
Ugh, they got us!
Squirtle.
-Squirtle. -
Youre not going to Squirtle out of this one!
-Its Meowth! -Meowth?
Im the Pokemon in charge here. Just wait till my human pets get back!
Na-na-na-na-na!
Dont believe him, Squirtles. Meowths a big liar.
Those humans arent Meowths pets.
Team Rockets trying to trick you all into doing their dirty work.
Squirtle.
Quiet, human!
Who are you going to believe, this human or a fellow Pokemon?
Squirtle. Squirtle...
-Ash, Pikachus in bad shape! -Huh?
Weve got to do something!
Weve got to heal Pikachu with super potion before its too late.
But we dont have any super potion. What can we do?
-A shop in town sells it. -In town?
Squirtle Squad, please, youve got to let me go into town.
If I dont get the medicine, Pikachus in a lot of trouble!
Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle...
They know you humans are just trying to get away!
Trust me. I wont run away!
As soon as I buy the medicine, Ill come back. I promise!
Squirtle.
Squirtle says promises are cheap!
Im begging you. Please trust me.
Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle...
The Squirtle says if youre not back here by noon tomorrow,
the red-headed girl gets her hair dyed purple!
-Purple! Why you mangy little flea trap! -Huh?
When I get out of this, Im going to wrap your tail-
Misty, dont worry. Ill be back, okay?
So long! Be back in a flash!
Good luck.
Even if that kid does make it back, well all be long gone.
Just hold on a little longer, Pikachu. Ill get you that super potion!
I got to keep going. Pikachu needs me to get that medicine.
Just dont look down.
Man, that was close!
Thats it. Thats the place!
I beg your pardon.
Pikachu, dont give up.
Ash will be back here with the medicine soon. Just hold on!
Where are Jessie and James already?
- All right, freeze! - Huh?
These are ice packs were gunning, I mean ice guns were packing!
Its Team Rocket!
Cool! Were just like those supervillains in the comic books, except better looking.
And even meaner!
Listen up! We want all the flash powder youve got!
- And a large roll of dental floss. - What do you need them for?
You want to get rid of the Squirtle Squad, dont you?
The flash powder will scare them out of town!
-The floss is for our teeth. -The Squirtle Squad!
-Ciao for now. -Farewell!
Look! Its snowing!
Its Team Rocket! Ive got to get back before they get Pikachu!
Super potion, please! Oh, no, I dont need a new gun!
-Dont shoot me, please. Im not- - Stop!
Drop those! Hes not with Team Rocket!
Step on it, Jenny. I got to get there by noon!
Just hang on, Ash! Huh?
A dead end.
These flash blasts will scare the shells off the Squirtle Squad.
And in the confusion, well snatch Pikachu!
Heres a secret entrance to the cave.
Gee, theres not much room.
The passageways too narrow for an adult
-but maybe you can squeeze through. -I can do it!
Be careful, Ash!
Its too dark to see in here. Hey, I know!
-Charmander, I choose you! -Char! Char!
-Charmander, lead the way! -Charmander!
Theyre gone! Pikachu!
Misty!
Whatve you done? I told you Id be back by noon and I am!
What did you do with my friends!
-Were right here. -Huh?
-Squirtle... -Wheres the super potion for Pikachu?
Oh, uh, here!
Hurry! Lets spray it on Pikachu!
-So, Misty, your hair isnt purple. -Nope! Im still a redhead!
The Squirtle Squad was bluffing!
They play tricks but theyd never change a girls natural hair color!
-Hm? -Squirtle. Squirtle. Squirtle...
That blast! Its Team Rocket!
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love,
to extend our reach to the stars above...
-Jessie. -James.
Squirtle Squad, its payback time for insulting Team Rocket.
Bombs away!
Meowth, carry Pikachu up the ladder!
And the rest of you are in for a real blast. Get it?
Meowth!
Pikachu!
Quick, run for cover! Head for the cave!
Hurry!
Squirtle.
-Squirtle! -Squirtle.
Here I come!
Oh, Ash!
Hey, Squirtle, are you okay?
Squirtle...
Here come two more!
Save yourself, Squirtle. Run for it!
- Whoa, Squirtle! - Squirtle!
Look out!
No more Squirtle Squad!
The towns going to give us medals and well be heroes!
Not so fast!
-Who said that? -Huh?
- Werent they... - Didnt they...
How did they... - Squirtle! Water Gun attack now!
Squirtle!
- Come back here! -Pikachu!
Looks like Team Rockets blasting off again!
A fire! The blasts must have set it off!
If it keeps burning, the whole town could go up in smoke!
-Dont worry, Jenny. Ive got an idea. -Oh.
Listen, if you Squirtles work together,
you can combine your water guns to put out the fire!
And so we gratefully award this certificate to the Squirtle Squad.
Thank you for saving our town from the fire.
Because of your skill and bravery,
we proudly appoint you the town firefighters!
Squirtle!
Pi, Pi, Pika, Pikachu.
Hey, Ash, that Squirtle is following us!
Squirtle. Squirtle.
Would you like to come along with us, Squirtle?
Squirtle!
-Guess Ive caught a new Pokemon! -Pikachu!
-Caught? What do you mean caught? -Oh, whats the difference?
Its on our side now!
One more adventure, one more new friend,
but theres much more excitement waiting just around the bend!
