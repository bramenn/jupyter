Don't panic!
The hymn!
Don't stop chanting!
Withdraw!
Don't be foolish! If we fall, who will protect Assiah?!
Demons!
Is he a demon or something?!
You've gotta be kidding me!
Let's go!
Demon? Who are you talking about? You're more demonic than I am.
Ah, I've done it again.
What am I doing...?
You lost little lamb, confess your sins and say your prayers.
I didn't do anything bad!
Then where did those wounds come from?
I fell on the stairs.
Your back is dirty, too.
It was quite a fall.
And your nosebleed?
I fell onto an insanely hot babe -
What?! After her, Rin! Lead the way!
Liar!
You got into a fight again, right?! Why do you always have to do that?!
Let go, stupid old fart!
Your boss from your part-time job called earlier.
They said that they don't need someone who doesn't come back after completing a delivery.
You're saying that as if someone like me could do a decent job to begin with.
Don't act like a spoiled brat!
One day, you'll have to leave this abbey and make it on your own!
It's my duty as your guardian to prepare you for that!
Or will you become a priest and lead the abbey?
Who'd want this rotting old church?
Father!
I'm done getting ready to move.
Now I just have to actually move the stuff.
Good job.
Did you get into a fight again?
Shut up!
Even though they're twins, they're totally different!
The younger one, Yukio, is a talented athlete with amazing grades.
He aced the entrance exam for True Cross High School and he'll be starting there this spring.
On the other hand, the older one is a problem child.
Hey Rin, if only you had just a fraction of your little brother's virtues.
Shut the fuck up!
I really need to buy a new heater...
Reverend Fujimoto,
you have a guest.
Clean this up before the sermon!
Yukio, treat his wounds.
Sure. Come, Brother.
That stings!
Try to bear with it just a little longer.
Ah, so you're moving to a dorm?
Yeah, school starts next week.
After 15 years, it's time to leave this abbey.
So is this the last time you'll treat my wounds?
If I become a doctor, I'll be able to help you anytime.
As long as you pay me, that is.
Your dream is to become a doc, right?
Keep up the good work! I'm sure you can do it!
Don't forget about the fees, brother.
But will you be all right without me around?
What? Are you going to scold me, too?
I'm just worried. And it's not just me.
Father and the others from the abbey are too.
You get into fights every day and you lose jobs so quickly.
I'm worried about it, too.
I know I should be growing up already.
But...
Hit!
You're great, Shiratori!
There are too many of them.
They get in the way all the time.
Oi! What the hell are you doing?!
Shut the fuck up!
I'm just shooting down these shitty birds! Shut up and watch!
It might be a test for you.
From who?
God.
You're more and more like the old man.
Ah, there he is!
They're looking for part-timers in the Southern Cross Mall.
A part-time job?
We called them, and they were like come right away for the interview.
Why did you call them without asking me?!
Go on, I'll lend you my suit.
Why should I wear a suit for a part-time job interview?
Here, my shoes. Don't dirty them!
And here's a map and your CV. Just add your photo there.
Brother...
I have no choice...
What the hell?! How are you supposed to tie this thing?!
Whatever. It's easier without that thing.
Thank you for your help.
It's all right. Really, don't worry about it.
You should be happy. Your parents are watching over you.
If you have problems, ask your mommy and daddy first.
And if they can't help you, then come to ask the Exorcists.
It must be hard to be an Exorcist.
You have to get rid of things that don't even exist.
Demons do exist in our hearts.
Bullshit.
They just asked to consult you.
By the way, what's with that get-up?
Everyone insisted on me going to the interview so I borrowed it.
And the necktie?
It's faster without it!
Heh, you just don't know how to tie it, do you?
Give it to me. I'll teach you.
Raise your collar and close the button.
Man, you're only growing up physically...
You were so cute when you were little, going Daddy, Daddy all the time.
That was ages ago!
I'm grown-up now, stop embarrassing me!
Grown-up? I can't see any grown-ups around!
Hey!
If it's that embarrassing, show me how much you've grown!
Don't look down on me!
I'll show you that I can do it by myself!
Open your eyes wide and look!
That's not how the saying goes.
Shut up, you geezer!
Rin Okumura, 15 years old.
You want to start working right after finishing middle school?
I don't exactly like school...
You're very wrong if you think you can keep doing as you please in this world!
That's true.
Line these up at the front of the store.
All of them?
You mean you can't do it?
I can do it.
The boss is picking on the new guy again.
There's no way he'll finish that in one day.
Boss, this is the last one!
What are you doing?! Can't you do anything properly?! Get a hold of yourself! Got it?!
I'm not fit for this job after all...
What's wrong, new boy?
Cheer up!
Here, have some.
What's this?! It's horrible!
Figures... It was cheap so the Boss bought a lot,
but it's not selling at all.
Could I try cooking it?
This is our new product, fried soba!
Would you like some?
It's delicious!
And it smells great!
The secret of the flavor is this sauce!
And as a final touch, add some dried fish for topping!
This way, it'll taste as if cooked by a professional chef!
I want some!
Me too! Me too!
Boss?
The staff meeting is at 8 o'clock every morning.
Don't you dare to be late.
Work hard tomorrow, too!
You got the job! That's great, new boy!
You got the job?!
Yeah, she said work hard tomorrow, too!
That's great, brother!
Thanks!
I'm so happy to hear some good news before leaving!
What are you all in tears about?
No tears here!
Come home already! Today we're having Yukio's farewell party, so we're making sukiyaki!
Gotcha!
Stop! Give it back, please!
This is yours, right?
Huh?
She was at our place earlier...
Hey, wait!
Excuse me!
What's that?!
A monkey?
Damn!
Watch out!
Yui!
Are you okay, Yui?! Yui?!
Rin is late.
I'll go look for him.
Yeah, me too.
You were here after all.
All the sukiyaki will be gone.
Come on, let's go home.
Even if I went home, how could I look everyone in the eye?
What's wrong?
I got fired.
We don't need a maniac like that in the store.
What happened?
I don't know either!
Don't talk like that!
Everyone was so happy that you finally got a job!
Why are you so careless?!
Explain it so that we'll understand!
How could I explain something that I don't get myself?!
Brother?
Sorry...
Anyway, let's go home!
Father's waiting too.
Ah, you're back?
Rin Okumura?
Who are you?
I'm Yui's father.
Thank you for saving her.
Did she get hurt?
Thanks to you, just a few scratches.
That's good.
She's always been a careless child,
so she's had a lot of accidents, falling from stairs and stuff.
That's not it!
She's not careless!
She's being bullied!
She gets her hair pulled and her stuff taken...
Did you see it?
What was he like?
I've never seen anything like it before...
Small, with a face like a monkey...
What?!
Where are you going?
I'm going to call the school and get them to punish the ones who bully her!
Or else...
That's not it!
It's not humans who bully me!
It's bad fairies!
Fairies?
They come into my room during the night and torture me!
Lately even outside of my room...
She's always had a lively imagination.
I've heard these tales many times,
but recently her imagination and reality get mixed up too often...
It's not imagination!
Rin!
Why can't you believe her?
Who can she depend on if not even her parents believe her?
Take her more seriously -
What are you doing?!
This is a four-leaf clover charm. It should protect you.
Thank you!
Don't blame her, please.
She depends on her parents the most.
Let's go home, Yui.
What's with that? Did he actually accept that?
You're in no position to scold others!
Also, Rin, you're not allowed to go out for a while!
Huh? Why?
The boss from that shop came by earlier with this.
It's a demand for the shop equipment and goods you destroyed!
What's with this?!
Rin! You won't get any sukiyaki!
Whyyy?!
I thought so...
The things I sent yesterday will be arriving in the morning, so I have to leave early.
Take care.
PS: Don't make Father worry any more.
Yukio.
That's so heartless.
At least say goodbye.
What the-?!
What are these? Bugs?
Why doesn't anyone care about them?
Hey Okumura!
Do you have a moment?
You're not allowed to go out for a while!
Are you scared, Okumura?
Do you want to hide under your Mommy's skirt?
Sorry about yesterday.
We were just playing with the pigeons, but my hand acted on its own...
What's wrong with him?
How much should we pay?
You know, my parents are kinda famous
and I'll probably get into True Cross Academy.
It'd be a bother if rumors started spreading.
You'll go to the same school as Yukio?
That must be a bother.
Yep. So hold your mouth. We'll pay up.
So let's just both keep silent, okay?
Huh? And I was wondering what you wanted.
I don't need your money. And I won't say a word.
Sorry but I've got stuff to do now.
Are you playing the cool guy?
Seriously, be honest with yourself!
You're so poor you couldn't even get into a proper school!
Take it. Your brother Yukio worked his ass off and got in with a scholarship, right?
So he borrows! So pitiful!
He can't even pay his own tuiti -
You can badmouth me as much as you want,
but don't you dare say another word about my Brother!
This hurt...
You went too far!
Huh? He's not human?
Why doesn't anybody see it...?
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, huh?
I'll let you enjoy my pain in twofold!
That's enough, Shiratori. If you go further...
Shut up!
Where should I burn you?
Your nose? Your mouth? Or your eyes?
He's really...
Human barbecue!
Stop!
Stop!
I'm burning?
Blue flames?
Shit! Run!
Heh, those blue flames are the proof of Satan's offspring.
I wasn't mistaken after all.
My name is Astaroth. Shall we go, Young Master?
Lord Satan is waiting for you.
Satan?
Mischief is in their hearts.
Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavors,
give them after the work of their hands, render to them their desert.
Smite them down and let them not rise again.
You... you're an Exorcist?!
Blessed be the Lord.
Father...
I shall seal that mouth of yours, so that you cannot spout your curses!
You have heard my curse.
The Lord is my strength
and my shield.
Thou shall perish!
Are you okay?
Or rather, is he okay?
The demon has left him. He should wake up later.
Demon?
You can see them now too, right?
This is...
The Coal Tar that hangs on to dust,
and gathers around dark places and evil humans.
This world consists of two dimensions that face each other like mirrors.
One is our material world, Assiah.
The other is the nothingness of demons, Gehenna.
These two worlds are separate and they're not supposed to interact at all.
But the demons possess the material of this world and interact with it.
Stand up. They've found out the truth about you.
And they'll come to hunt you down.
You must hide before that.
Wait a sec, I don't get it!
Demons? What are they?
What am I?
You're not human.
You are the child of a demon born of a human.
And not just any old demon, either.
You're the child of the demon among demons, the evil god Satan.
Don't you ever say again that you're my father!
Rin!
Finally I could meet you, my son.
I'll become an Exorcist!

It wasn't by chance
that I met you.
This is what they call fate.
Reflected in your eyes is
the way we keep on shining together.
Let's keep our gazes locked
so it won't fade away.
(Please be) Maybe the day will come
(With me) that we'll lose our way
while looking for the door to the future.
Ready, ready, ready for the take off
We'll soar high
towards an unknown world.
So don't let go of my hand. (Buddy)
Ready, ready, ready for the take off.
Hold on to the bonds we have
while aiming for
the place of our dreams.
