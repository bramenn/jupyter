It appeared as though humanity would be destroyed by the demons.
But a single mage saved them all.
He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
Asta and the others finally arrived at the Underwater Temple.
But once they got there...
You guys are after the magic stone, aren't you?
If you want it, why don't we play a little game?
and nine temple mages were waiting for them!
The high priest told Asta and the other Black Bulls, who were separated,
that if they wanted the magic stone, they must battle the temple mages, nine-on-nine.
Victory goes to the first team to wipe out the other team,
or whichever team has the most members left in the end.
Yay! This is awesome!
A blood-soaked battle! I'm super pumped!
Nine?
There should be ten of us... We're missing one.
That's so easy to understand!
All right! Bring it on!
That's funny...
I can't seem to sense any magic from you.
Guess I picked a loser.
Wanna find out if I'm actually a loser or not?
Temple Battle Royale
Now, then, why don't we watch from here?
I've got plenty of food and drink!
Hey, you old geezer, don't leave me out of the game!
I got all pumped up, but now I'm sad.
You're a bit too strong.
All the people outside, as well as myself, are very excited for this game.
It'd be no fun if it were to end quickly.
Looks like you really do get it, gramps.
You've got good taste.
I do, don't I?
Ooh, it looks like a few match-ups have already begun.
All right. If any of mine lose, I'll kill'em.
So cold... Damn that geezer.
He's gonna pay for this!
Hilarious!
You're at a total disadvantage with fire magic in a place like this.
Looks like I win.
I'd rather not pick on frail-looking guys like you.
Are you gonna fight me?
I know you guys.
You're the Black Bulls, aren't you?
You're the weakest of the Magic Knights.
Marie's waiting for me. Hurry up and come at me, damn it.
Just so you know, it's pretty pointless for you to wave around that rusty sword.
My mollusk magic can parry any kind of attack.
I see...
Isn't this exciting?
Oh, by the way, what are your knights' ranks?
They're all junior magic knights.
I'm surprised you even know about that, living down here.
According to your ranking system,
my temple mages would be more powerful than intermediate knights!
Those juniors don't stand a chance!
What? Really?
Well, that's not good...
Unless those idiots are actually stronger than usual for their titles.
Wh-Wh-Wh-What?!
Don't think I'm gonna get discouraged just because I'm surrounded by water.
I'm gonna serve all of you up like grilled fish!
He must've been one of the weaker ones.
So... I wonder where all the strong ones are?
Good grief.
I need to finish this nonsense quick so I can go back to doting on Marie.
This... isn't right...
My mollusk magic should be able to deflect any kind of physical attack.
My sword is anti-magic! That junk won't work!
What?
Next, next!
Good job, you idiots! Beat the crap out of them!
Those fools let down their guard!
Hey, gramps, I forgot! We should bet on which team is gonna win!
I bet 10,000 yuls on the Bulls!
Grr... The battle's just begun!
They won't be able to defeat the remaining priests so easily!
Especially the Three Great Priests, who are on par with senior knights.
Badump, badump...
Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak...
Whew... Man, that was close.
There's no way I could fight a guy who looks that strong.
I've been trying to get to the places I marked outside, but I can't for some reason.
That means I can only use my spatial magic to get to places I can see.
Oh, I forgot to mention this,
but you won't be able to leave my playground until the game's over.
Whoa! Are you watching me, gramps?!
Hey, Finral, why the hell are you hiding? Hurry up and fight, or I'll kill you!
Huh? Yami?!
Wait, are you with the old guy?
We're enjoying some food and drinks while we watch you guys fight.
What?! Come on, make him stop this violent game!
What? It's fun to watch because it's so violent.
That's right!
When did you two hit it off so well?!
It's definitely no fun if you're not gonna fight.
Don't let that coward get away.
There we go! Nuisance spell activated.
Game Magic: Monster Toy.
Scary!
How entertaining! I should use more of these!
Hey, you old geezer...
Let's do this one next. This'll probably kill them!
Are you sure you're actually on their side?
Nice drawing, though.
Now, then... Let's see how the others are holding up.
That bastard Grey turned into a crab, and I don't know where he went,
so I'll just have to kill him later.
Oh? Is Charmy battling?
S-Such destructive force...
Th-The Underwater Temple is amazing.
And so is its seafood!
S-So good! Munchy, munchy...
This is the best I've ever had!
So this is the Underwater Temple's seafood!
I wish my meal-saving prince could have some, too!
Okay! This entire ecosystem is mine!
I'm going to eat absolutely everything!
That one there... What exactly is she doing?
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! What a huge haul!
Found you!
La?
My, what a cute little target. I almost feel bad that I'm going to defeat you.
So you're finally here.
But right now, I'm overflowing with undersea mana.
If you want me to chew you up the way I chewed up those fish,
bring it on!
Song Magic: Mother Lullaby.
I feel so nice...
Why, yes, I can still eat more...
One down!
Just so you know, sleeping counts as a K.O.
How do you like the power of one of my Great Priests?
She's not getting any food for a week.
Now, then...
I wonder if I'll see those two next.
All right! My clothes are finally dry!
Let's see... Who am I gonna fight next?
Hey, Luck. I guess you're still alive.
Yup! I defeated one of the enemy guys already.
I headed this way because I felt a strong presence over here, but...
Looks like I was right...
All right... let's decide who gets a piece of'em fir
Hey! No fair, Luck! You bastard!
Ya snooze, ya lose, Magna!
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Shield.
It's tough! My lighting should work pretty well against water, though.
Well, well, aren't you lively?
What the heck are these things?!
This ki... Someone's there.
Come on, Grandpa. Do you really have to hit us with your nuisance spells, too?
Well, whatever. That was a good warm-up.
Hup!
He took out something that huge? Who the heck is he?
Hey, there!
You're Asta, right?
Huh? Yeah, that's right...
I've heard about you! You use a strange sword that cancels out magic, right?
Uh, yes... Wait, who'd you hear that from?!
Never mind that! Check out this dance!
The hell?! He just started dancing!
But it's a really cool dance!
Do you think they'd like this dance up on the surface, too?
Heck yeah!
The name's Kiato!
My dream's to become a dancer who captivates the whole kingdom!
He just started talking about his dream?!
Although people from the Underwater Temple can go to the kingdom's beaches,
we can't go to the capital. It's against the rules.
But if we win this fight, Grandpa said...
Oh, the high priest is my grandpa.
Anyway, he said we could use the high priest's authority to go up to the surface!
I'm gonna make a name for myself and become a super famous dancer!
He just told me all about this huge dream!
Hey, wait a sec...
This all seems pretty familiar.
So listen...
I'm gonna take you down for the sake of my dream!
He's fast!
I have my own dream, too!
Huh?
I wanna become the strongest man who protects the Clover Kingdom,
the Wizard King!
So for that dream...
I'm gonna take you down!
I like it!
Then let's bet our dreams on a head-to-head showdown!
Bring it on!
Wh-What am I going to do? I haven't learned a single attack spell yet.
Hey, there! I finally found you!
Sh-Shoot! I'm in trouble!
Y-You want to take on a royal such as myself?
You've got some guts! This is your chance to run away if you want!
First off, I'm glad you could make it, Noelle!
H-How do you know my name?
Oh, right. I guess you can't tell with this thing on my face.
Huh?
Kahono!
I've been waiting for you, Noelle!
Kahono... I had no idea you were from the Underwater Temple.
Why did you help me learn magic?
I was actually looking for people who wanted to come to the Underwater Temple
while I practiced singing on that beach.
You see, when we have guests, Grandpa... I mean, the high priest, always holds games.
If I win, I'll be able to go to the surface
and make my dream to become an idol come true!
Your dream? Then you used me?!
Huh? No.
It's true that I wanted to help you, since you were working so hard,
and it's also true that I wanted to become friends with you.
But from now on, we'll fight fair and square as opponents in this game!
No! We're supposed to be friends!
Yup!
Friends are people who can clash over things that are precious to them,
but keep smiling together even then!
Song Magic: Mother Lullaby.
What is this spell?
I-It's going to make me...
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!
Now you're ready to fight?
Song Magic: Destructive Beat!
Come on, now, Noelle!
You'll never win if you just keep defending!
What do you think you're doing?!
She only let off some magic energy, but look at that force!
Amazing!
Huh? What're you doing, Noelle?
An attack like that won't have any effect on me.
Aim straight! That sucked!
Shut up!
I still can't control my magic when I'm attacking, you idiot!
That's not it. You're already controlling your magic, Noelle.
Huh?
You're subconsciously trying not to attack people.
You must not want to hurt anyone.
But are you sure you're okay with that?
Why did you come here, Noelle?
Didn't you come here to make something come true?
If you don't fight for it and win it,
you'll never get what you want!
Fine!
This guy's really strong!
And what's with his moves?
It's like his mind's gone somewhere else. It's really hard to read his ki!
I think he's even throwing off my senses.
Is this his magic?
It's just like I thought.
If you're going up against a real sword,
your anti-magic sword is nothing more than a lump of iron!
And if I add in my dance magic, you won't be able to follow my moves!
How do you like my grandson? Isn't he strong?
Yeah, the kid definitely knows how to handle a sword.
But...
Come on, now! Just surrender already, Asta!
This isn't good! I'm about to lose!
He really is like water. There's no way to catch him...
Wait, maybe brute strength isn't the way to go here!
I probably shouldn't try to capture water, since it has no distinct shape!
Anyway, I need to calm down.
That's it!
I will also become like water!
Monkeying around won't get you anywhere!
Don't sell a monkey short!
I can't use magic!
And that's why...
I'll recreate magic with my body!
Pretty sure there are limits when you can't use magic!
What?
In that case...
I'll use this chance...
to go beyond my limits!
Jeez... Just how athletic is this kid?
My idiot's ability to pick things up quick is even greater!
What a rude man... Trying to set up a sneaky trap for a defenseless woman like me.
You can't really complain if you fall for a trap yourself, can you?
Seriously? Vanessa's usually drunk and useless before she gets warmed up.
We're in top shape today. I should've bet more, damn it.
These guys aren't junior mages at all!
But man, that lady's got some nice boobies.
Hey, old man. Could you get that magic stone ready?
A really dangerous lot called the Eye of the Midnight Sun is after that stone.
It'd be in your best interests to just hand it over to us.
The best part of a game is turning the tables.
You can't get lamer than bluffing, old man.
I'm not bluffing!
If my son and grandkids get serious, we'll turn things around in an instant!
My son is the strongest mage of the Underwater Temple!
Uh-oh... I think you're getting tired, Magna.
You can take a little break.
I couldn't feel better, you idiot.
You butt out, Luck.
Sorry to drag you into my dad's game like this.
Dad? You're that geezer's son?
He's strong... His magic is as deep as the sea.
No doubt about it... He's definitely the strongest one here.
You two should come at me at once.
I'd rather not hurt you any more than I need to.
At the very least, I'll end all this in an instant.
Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!
You ain't ending anyone, you bastard!
I'm not done having fun yet!
Huh?
Wh-What was that?
Wh-Wh-What the heck's going on?!
Looks like you're having fun.
Why don't you let us join in?
Petit Clover!
Why Don't You Let Us Join In?
Why Don't You Let Us Join In?
Looks like you're having fun.
Why don't you let us join in?
Munchy, munchy...
La?
I-I must've come to the wrong place.
Munchy, munchy... Have a bite.
Have a bite,'kay?
Well, if you insist, I guess I'll... join in.
I'll let you join in...
After you stir that pot.
Those who will not work do not get to munchy!
Stir, stir, stir...
Put your back into it! It's not all about strength!
I see... This is quite deep.
And so, Vetto realized his dream to become a chef and gave up on the magic stone.
Then everyone lived happily ever after!
That probably won't happen, huh?
Of course not!
To make the Eye of the Midnight Sun's dream come true,
I, Vetto of the Third Eye, shall obtain the magic stone!
