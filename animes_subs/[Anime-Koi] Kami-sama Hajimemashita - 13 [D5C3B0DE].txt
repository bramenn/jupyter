onnanoko hajimemashita
A tired girl starts her day
tameiki wa bioron no shirabe ni nite
With a sigh like the moan of a violin
akai mi hajikechatta
A cherry bursts in her mouth
mada anata wo shiranai
This was before we had met
konna koto hajimetette
This is the first time I've ever felt like this
manazashi wa aku no hana sakimidarete mo
I could see that your pretty eyes were filled with contempt
ie e to tsuzuku
But I had to go home
basu sutoppu demo anata wa tsurenai
Even at the bus stop, you gave me the cold shoulder
karameta hanabi myaku utsu
The fireworks in the sky pulse
koi no shiruetto
In a silhouette of love
karui mahou
With a little magic,
usotsuki na kuchibiru
Two sets of lying lips
sou kasaneteru
Lock together
ano ne
You see
nee kamisama
God...
warui ko ni naritai yo
I'd like to be a naughty girl
ii ko ni shiteru kara
I'm tired of being good
onegai dayo
So, please
zurui koto sasetoite
It's for a good reason
ii koto shitai nara
So let me be bad for once
sukaato hirogaesu shite
By flipping my skirt
sugu kaeru yo
I'll be back soon
doyoubi wa haresou da
It looks like Saturday is going to be sunny

God, it has already started
Ko na ka tta

Please leave. o
You are being evicted from your apartment.
I'm going on a trip. Please don't look for me. -Dad
Huh?!
ANIME-KOI
PRESENTS
We'll be back soon!
We're back!
They...
don't need me.
Nanami?
Nanami!
Where have you gone?
Nanami!
Mizuki-dono, please!
I'm keeping the miasma back as best as I can!
I don't...
have anywhere left to go.
Tomoe-kun, why are you making me do all the work?
Look for Nanami!
Did she disappear?
Wait, I'm coming too!
Mizuki-dono, the shrine!
Take this!
What?
Good luck!
How could you?
Wait, are we supposed to hold back the miasma now?
It's coming for us, Onikiri!
Get away! Get away!
Oh dear.
Both familiars are gone?
What are they going to do about this?
Well I could drop down and clean up but...
I guess I'll entertain myself a bit more.
Oh what a great Wind Deity I am!
Nanami-chan!
Nanami-chan!
You here, Nanami-chan?
Nanami-chan?
Tomoe-sama!
We've searched everywhere, but we can't find a single trace of her!
We can't even sense her presence!
It's as if she were never here!
Yeah, she wasn't by the station either.
W-We'll keep looking!
I'm going to town for a while, Tomoe.
It's Tomoe-kun!
He's in his traditional clothing too!
Yo, Fox.
So you finally decided to show yourself at school today.
And what's with the outfit? Did you wake up late and forget to change out of your pajamas?
Hey! Don't you dare cut me off
What the hell are you doing in the girls' bathr
Nanami...
Hey! What the hell's your problem?
You're never this agitated.
Did something happen to Nanami?
That's none of your business.
Oh, look. It's the crow kid. You seen Nanami-chan around?
She sort of disappeared on us.
Tomoe-kun, you were there too?
Go.
You're too violent, Tomoe-kun!
Nanami's gone?
We still can't find her. Do you think she left town?
She may have used one of her talismans.
Hey, you find her yet?
What do you think? I'm beat.
Same.
Where in the world has she gone?
I'm all alone again.
Whatever! This is how things were in the beginning anyway.
As if I could be a real deity.
The beginning?
Someone help me!
Get that dog away!
You can have mine, then.
Besides, I think it's a better fit for you.
Where have you been all this time?
This kid is supposed to be a deity?
What can a filthy girl like you do?!
I don't care if the temple crumbles.
Doesn't the shrine, your home, mean anything to you?!
The festival at the shrine's next weekend, right?
What's it called again?
Mikage-something.
We should get Hide-kun and Suzuki-kun to come too!
I like that idea!
I can't wait!
Mm-hm.
The shrine...
Mikage Shrine...
is my home!
And my home...
is in danger right now!
Nanami-sama.
Nanami-sama?
We found her!
I'll protect it. I have to try!
I might fail...
I might lose everything...
But I have to try,
because I'm the only one who can save the shrine!
Huh?
Where is that coming from?
W-What kind of miasma is this?!
Oh no! I dropped it!
What's going on?
The other miasma is getting sucked into that one!
What...
What on earth?
Hey, what's going on?
Why is it growing so much?
This isn't what I released!
This is not part of the plan!
Begone, miasma! Return to your contai
The miasma's spreading!
Tomoe-sama, we've found her!
Where is she?
She's heading toward the shrine.
What?
Nanami?
T-The gate!
The shrine!
This has to be the Earth Spider's miasma!
Earth Spider?
Don't you remember?
Mikage-sama sealed it away several centuries ago!
Oh!
Mikage-sama defeated the beast,
but the miasma it left behind was so enormous that he only managed to seal it!
That seal must have been undone somehow!
I don't know how...
I don't know how it was undone, but I do know that we're done for!
Kotetsu!
Kotetsu!
Tailwind Max!
Nanami-sama!
Kotetsu...
Nanami-sama, you've returned!
Kotetetsu-kun, are you okay?
You mustn't come closer!
We're okay because we're not human,
But since you are, you mustn't come in contact with the miasma!
Kotetsu...
Kotetsu-kun...
I'm sorry I left without saying anything!
Nanami-sama!
Nanami-sama!
Nanami-sama, we can't let this miasma reach the town!
We... We have to do something!
There are people down there who are looking forward to the festival.
I'll protect the city no matter what!
Nanami-sama!
Nanami-sama!
What?!
Nanami?
Nanami...
The Earth Spider?
The Earth Spider is starting to reveal itself.
This is freaking scary!
Nanami-sama!
Nanami!
Nanami-chan's ritual is repelling it!
Her dancing is flawless.
When did she get so...
Nanami-sama, you're so elegant!
So beautiful!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Girl...
My, what a divine performance!
Mikage?
Right.
Left.
Forward.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
That's right, Nanami, you're doing great.
Now all you have to do is not trip...
She tripped.
Nanami-sama!
Really?
Nanami-sama!
Tomoe!
Nanami!
I chose you as my master.
Don't be scared.
Tomoe!
Nanami, your bells!
Mizuki!
I'm your familiar too. I'll support you as best as I can.
That girl...
She's as I envisioned.
Mikage, you planned this from the beginning?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
W-What?
Mikage!
Mikage?
Nanami!
Are you hurt?
I did it.
I did it, Tomoe!
Yeah.
Nanami-sama!
Kotetsu's back to normal!
Kotetsu-kun!
Thank goodness... Thank goodness!
Nanami-sama, thank you so much!
Nanami-chan, you're amazing.
Tomoe...
What is it?
Catch me.
Thus, the day of the long-awaited fall festival finally came.
Oh, it looks like it's a huge success.
That's totally unhygienic!
But come on!
People actually came!
I spent quite a bit of time handing those fliers out.
But who put all of this up?
You can thank my crew and me for that.
We helped!
Princess!
Where did you get those clothes? They're super-cute!
Really?
Hold up!
How can you guys start the party without me?
The Dragon King has arrived! This show's mine now!
You came too!
You're the one who sent me this invitation!
So I decided I'd do you stinkin' landlubbers a favor and come here.
Landlubbers?
Why the hell are you here looking like a demon?!
At least pretend to be in disguise!
What the hell do you want, Fox?
Get away! You landlubbers stink!
Earth Deity.
It is our pleasure to meet you.
We are spirits that hail from lands south of here.
We traveled here when we heard that you knew the ancient Kagura dances.
If we could have your blessing...
We would be ever so grateful.
Glory to the Earth Deity!
It's Kurama-sama!
For cryin' out loud, can't I get one night to myself? This was supposed to be low-key.
Oh, you're back Nanami?
You can't call that outfit low-key.
You there. Give me a mask.
Of course! These are called death masks! They
I know. It looks like your face just died a bit.
Keep the change.
That was a person, right?
Nanami-sama, it's almost time for your performance!
Oh, right.
We'll prepare your change of clothes.
We'll be waiting!
Okay.
I managed to dance in front of that beast,
but dancing in front of a crowd is a different story!
Don't worry about it, young lady.
Oh, it's that one ladyor is that a guylady?
I hope you weren't talking about me.
Have these. I bought them in town.
Thanks!
I'm sure you'll do a fine job.
See ya around, girl!
Let's meet again someday!
Nanami!
Nanami...
And so the festival ended with a magnificent finale.
Those who were touched by her performance left with glowing hearts that night.
That went much better than expected.
The rumors about us should die down now.
You did a great job, Nanami-chan. Your dance was splendid!
Thanks, Mizuki.
But my muscles are sore...
I really hope we get more followers now.
Yeah!
Oh, we're out of sake. I'll go grab some more.
We'll fetch something to go with the sake.
Onikiri.
Tomoe, how was my dancing?
Huh?
It was quite something. You did well.
Anything else?
What do you mean? That's it.
That's it? Nothing else?
Something like, It was magnificent!?
Wow, you really have nothing else.
It was magnificent.
More than anything else.
Wait, I couldn't hear that! Can you say that again?
Too bad! No second chances!
Come on! Say it again!
Shut up!
Actually, I did hear it.
That makes me happy.
Nanami...
Could I make a contract as your familiar?
But haven't we already?
This one's from my heart.
Please, God
I...
I want to meet her
God, I'm in pain
Because, she...
didn't come today either.
I have a request, God
Please, save me
farewell, Baby
