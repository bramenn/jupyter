SCRIPT
Just for five seconds,
I want you to draw Mr. Braun's attention,
so he doesn't notice any shaking from the experiment.
Got it!
I'll just have to seduce him.
Want to touch it?
It's pretty firm.
It is.
Right?
Leave it to me.
You're seducing him, right?
Yup, what about it?
Never mind. I'm counting on you.
Okey-dokey.
Now!
Assistant, go!
What?
Oh, no... I failed.
How many times do I have to tell you?
It stopped?
My assistant?
No...
What is this?
No way!
What do you mean...
No way?
OP
suujuuoku mono kodou no kazu sae
Even the world's billions of heartbeats
anata ni wa matataki teido no saji na toukyuu
Are nothing to you but a fleeting and insignificant question
kako ni torawarete mirai wo nageku mo
We may be trapped in the past or lament the future
chiri hitotsu gosan wo yurusanu hitsuzen
But predetermination does not allow the slightest mistake
mugen ni hirogaru yume mo egaku mirai mo
The infinite dreams and imagined futures before us
bokutachi ni yurusareta kyoei no genri
Are naught but vain theories we may hold
yuugen sore wa futatsu no hari ga shimesu
Finitude is what the two clock hands show
zankoku na yakujou to sentaku e
As they point toward a cruel destiny and choice
Hacking to the Gate
dakara ima ichibyou goto ni sekaisen wo koete
And now I cross the boundary between worlds each second
kimi no sono egao mamoritai no sa
Because I want to protect that smile of yours
soshite mata kanashimi no nai jikan no ruupu e to
And a loop in time without sadness will once again
nomikomarete yuku kodoku no kansokusha
Engulf me, a lonely observer

In other words,
the 42 CRT on the first floor
just happens to function as the lifter.
So we were only able to send
D-mail when the studio was open and the TV was on...
That makes a lot of sense!
Don't be so loud. It hurts my head...
Are you okay?
Mr. Braun...
I never thought you would resort to violence.
In a way, it's your own fault.
You're the one who wanted to run an experiment!
Anyway, we almost completely understand
how the Phone Microwave works now.
Which means that next...
We should consider physically transporting an object through time.
Impossible.
Don't dismiss it so quickly!
It's going to end up jelly, no matter what we do.
And how the heck do you fit a human into 36 bytes...
Is this really the time for showing off?
Why would I want to show off to you?
Look at the title of my paper.
The Analysis of Nerve Pulse Signals
Stored in Memory Within the Temporal Lobe.
Can I get that in Japanese?
Essentially, it has to do with people's memories.
I majored in neuroscience.
Put simply,
the brain stores memories as pulse signals.
They're a type of electrical data.
Data... You can't mean...
That's right.
Sending a human through time is impossible,
but it might be possible to send their memory data.

In other words, you go back to the past!
Overwrite Memory Data!
Me on 2010/8/11 AD
It's more of a time leap than time travel.
It's me.
All the lines have converged at one point.
The plan will now enter its final stages.
The goddess who rules the present...
Begin Operation Verdandi!
Begin what now?
Explain what you're talking about a little.
I'm saying we're going to do that time leap you're talking about.
Begin now.
But we'll need a lot of stuff to do it.
Of course, we only have to read memories stored in the temporal lobe,
so I think I can get everything in Akiba...
But...
What's wrong?
One problem is that
I don't think the Phone Microwave will be able
to sufficiently compress the memory data.
And...
What?
Nothing.
All right.
I'll make a list of parts I need for now.
It's too hard for Mayushii to understand it at all.
Christina just explained it.
You're sending your mind, as it exists right now, to the past.
Sounds scary.
Is the D-mail not good enough?
There are too many chaotic variables with the D-mail.
One message can change things you'd never expect.
But it's okay to send memories into the past?
If nothing else, you can
prevent the past from changing, to a degree.
You wouldn't have the entire city of Akiba changing...
The city?
Nothing, never mind.
Huh?
But what happens to you
after you send your memories?
Your body is still here, isn't it?
Well...
So, Mayushii is talking to Okarin now, right?
Then, you're saying Mayushii goes back a week,
and then relives the week, right?
What happens if she doesn't talk to Okarin this time?
I assume that you would recall that we spoke,
but the fact of our having spoken would be erased.
In other words, Mayushii would remember us talking,
but Okarin wouldn't?
I'd imagine so.
Then, that's kind of sad.
For me?
Nope.
For Mayushii.
It's Moeka-san!
Moeka-san!
You look rather unhappy, Shining Finger.
Did you get rid of the time machine?
We're still using it.
And now, we might be able to do a time leap
Don't tell her about that!
But Moeka-san's a lab member, too, right?
She is, but...
What's a time leap?
Just what it sounds like!
We can send memories through time.
Memories...
Moeka-san?
Moeka-san!
Is she okay?
It would be faster to head for Akibaoo first, I guess?
Mayuri-oneechan!
It's Nae-chan!
What's wrong?
Yo.
You're still dressed like that?
The boss told me to stay this way all day.
You'll poison children's minds.
Poison?
I'm careful never to walk around with poison.
Huh?
Anyway, Nae said she wanted to
talk to Okabe Rintarou, so we were looking for you.
To me?
I'm sorry!
My dad was really mean back there!
Nae-chan...
You came all this way to say that?
What a well-trained little pet.
She's not a pet.
Don't worry.
I cause trouble for Mr. Braun all the time.
We're even.
That's not like the Okabe Rintarou I know...
Okarin's always like this.
Mayushii's gonna get going, okay?
Meeting someone?
Yup!
I'm going to give the cosplayer, Fubuki-chan, her outfit.
Come to think of it, it's almost time for Comima.
Yup.
Bye!
See you, Suzu-san and Nae-chan!
See you!
Okay, let's head back ourselves.
No, I need to find the parts Christina asked me for.
Makise Kurisu works with SERN.
A SERN spy?
No way.
All your base are...
You can't sneak up on me!
It's against the rules!
So, you were posting on @channel.
I realized you were an @channeler a long time ago.
I wasn't, no...
No!
There's no point in hiding it now.
This sucks...
All right.
From now on,
I officially give you the title of Channeler...
Don't give me any more weird nicknames!
And please, keep this a secret!
Why?
You could list it on your resume.
If they knew a serious academic were posting,
they'd probably make a few threads about you.
Why would I care?
Then what? You'd sage them?
I hate myself for understanding that last sentence.
Either way, I feel better.
I can't imagine
anyone who's so terrible at hiding things
being a spy.
What does that mean?
The part-time warrior said you were a SERN spy.
What is that supposed to mean?
That's impossible.
Indeed.
You're an agent the Organization sent,
who's had a change of heart and now works as my assistant.
That's not true, either.
So how's the work going?
Work?
The time leap.
I bought all the parts.
Oh... That's right.
I should make it, shouldn't I?
I've come this far.
What is this?
You're getting scared?
That, too...
I keep asking myself what will happen if we really make it.
But more than that...
What?
I should tell you...
It seems like it's half-obvious already.
I can't do it here!
Let's go somewhere I can't see your face.
I've got a problem with my dad...
So your father was struck by lightning,
on the grassy plains of Arkansas, and fell to the dark side
If you're going to be a jerk, I'm not telling you.
All right. Tell me.
To put it simply, my dad doesn't like me.
No... He hates me.
And not as his daughter. As a scientist, as a rival.
My dad was a physicist.
I always liked hearing him
talk about the details of his work.
And so, by the end of elementary school,
I could understand his papers.
And then, I started writing my own papers,
and winning awards.
But I didn't care about the awards.
I loved debating with my father.
We exchanged papers by e-mail,
and our debates got deeper.
But...
Eventually, my dad stopped debating with me.
While I enjoyed the debates,
I was also winning them.
I pointed out mistakes he'd made,
and without even thinking about it, I hurt his pride.
My dad started taking it out on my mom.
He lost confidence,
and began withdrawing from his academic peers.
The last time I saw him,
he said this to me...
Do you pity me?
Do you look down on me?
You're my daughter. How dare you.
If I make a device that enables a time leap,
I think my dad might go insane.
Even more than before...
So that's why you're hesitant to make it?
But don't worry.
I'll end up doing it, regardless.
Just like you said, I love experimenting.
If I see a possibility, I have to investigate it.
Just like my dad used to...
The time I spent with my dad...
Then we begin Operation Verdandi immediately!
There's no time to waste!
The Organization stands at our very doorstep!
That's your response?
Of course...
I am Hououin Kyouma.
I have a destiny to change the world!
I shouldn't have said anything...
And we'll reconcile you with your dad, too!
Where is he?
H-He's in Aomori.
We'll need money to go...
When you work out the time,
tell me as soon as you can.
You can't mean to go with me.
Naturally!
I need you in peak mental condition, so you can further my ambitions!
I, Hououin Kyouma, shall accompany you.
And I shall use my masterful people skills
to reunite father and daughter.
What?
You're a self-proclaimed mad scientist, right?
Since when do mad scientists have people skills?
Well, um, you see...
Why are you laughing?
Sometimes you're a good guy, you know?
That's the problem.
Now that you understand my greatness, back to work.
Right, right!
Just so we're clear, this is now decided.
So I'm dragging you with me, whether you want to go or not!
Sounds good to me.
Mayuri-chan?
What's with all this stuff?
Shouldn't you call that Okarin guy?
It's okay...
I'm almost there.
Look at the label!
It says Makise right here!
It reads Makise pudding.
That's just a brand name,
like Morinaga pudding or Koiwai pudding.
Don't play stupid!
Who's Makise, anyway?
That's my name!
Christina Makise?
If only you'd written Christina instead,
I wouldn't have accidentally ingested the extra calories.
Don't eat other people's food!
And that's my spoon! Don't use it!
You use the lab's forks, don't you?!
I'm here...
What's all that?
Mayushii's cosplay materials and sleepover set!
Sleepover?
Yup!
I'm going to make some cosplay outfits for Comima.
Are you sure?
What about your parents?
I told them about it.
You're staying over, too, right?
To work on the Phone Microwave?
Yeah, I thought I might.
But it's kind of depressing to be here.
There's this Hououin something guy
who goes around eating people's pudding.
It's Hououin Kyouma!
Learn my name, already!
You're the last person I want to hear that from!
And don't ignore the part about the pudding!
Maybe I should leave?
No, I'll stay,
but if I do, then Okabe should leave.
What?!
The lab is the house of my soul!
I could never leave
Why is her condition for staying that I go shopping?
Come to think of it,
I've been running errands for my assistant since yesterday.
Christina?
Assistant
I demand compensation and an apology
I demand compensation and an apology
I demand two puddings, as punishment for the one you ate. And... We're taking a late bus to Aomori, due to finances.
What are you so happy about?
Don't forget your role as a lab member.
I'm not happy, stupid!
What?
It's nothing!
Let's get in, before Okabe gets back.
Okay.
My assistant again?
You know too much.
Youhknowhtoohmuch.
What?
Mayuri...
Mayuri!
Mayuri!
I'll never forgive you! Ever!
Okarin, Mayushii is very sad and very embarrassed.
Jeez!
Not only did you peep on us in the shower, you forgot all the shopping!
I can't believe it!
Hey, Okabe!
Okarin?
It's Daru-kun!
What's wrong?
Why are you here so late?
I knew it.
When I accessed it from the outside,
I thought there was something weird.
Is something wrong?
The lab is connected directly to the heart of SERN.
SERN?
You've taken over their system?
I guess so. I win the internet!
Or so I'd like to say,
but to be honest, I was connected before I even knew it.
SERN's been standing naked, outside my house,
this whole time.
Say what now?
Wait!
If we're connected, without our having done anything,
doesn't that imply that they've found us out,
and are connecting to us?
Hmm... But I don't think I've made any errors that would have gotten us caught.
Now we can use the LHC all we want.
It can't be...
The LHC?
SERN!
Okarin?
Is something wrong with your phone?
No...
Nothing.
