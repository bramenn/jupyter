This is bad... Very bad...
Subaru? What's wrong?
Ah, I see. This is where they suck you in.
No... Run! Hurry!
Miso Natto
Nah, not natto.
Wait there...
That'll be 363 yen.
Oh, a grooved-edge ten.
I'm...
going to...
save you...
I guess anyone's eyes would be tired after holing up in their room, gaming all day.
What's going on?
This stuff obviously isn't fake.
Which means...
So does this mean...
I've been summoned into a parallel world?!
I guess I can assume this is a fantasy world
with the typical medieval-style culture.
A realm where demihumans are commonplace,
and probably stuff like wars and adventures, as well.
And here, I'm...
Hey!
Watch out!
This is it! It's my turn!
This must be the event where I produce my first magic!
Look out!
Way to go!
Well done!
I guess I'm not quite ready to use magic...
I can't read this.
Hey, boy.
Those are some weird clothes. Are you traveling?
What are these?
Those are appas.
They understand me, though. The question is...
Huh? What kind of money is that?
You can't use that stuff in Lugunica.
That means you're flat broke, huh?
Get outta here! Don't interfere with my business!
There's no other way...
I'll just have to go around gathering information first.
This place is for demihumans only.
Ow! I can't... see...
Is this how it's supposed to be?
Wasn't I summoned into a parallel world?!
Where'd my protagonist status go?!
Damn it.

My cell phone still works...
Out of Range
But what's the point in having it?!
And my starting gear is way too wimpy!
You need a more substantial welfare program
to satisfy pressure-free generation kids like me!
I don't even have Excalibur or anything!
And besides, if I was summoned, where's the cute girl who summoned me?
Did she summon me only to leave me here alone?
Hey, is she finally here?! The cute girl who summoned... me...
What are you babbling about?
If you don't wanna get hurt, cough up whatever you've got!
Crap, it's a compulsory event...
Move it, move it!
You guys!
Out of my way!
Here we go!
Is that the cute girl who summoned me?!
Summoned? I dunno what you're talkin' about, but I'm busy!
Sorry! Live strong!
Wait, what? What?!
Hey, that didn't make you decide to be less hostile toward me, by any chance, did it?
Actually, it rained on our parade and made things worse.
Yeah, of course...
Just calm down, Natsuki Subaru.
Since ancient times, it's the rule that anyone
summoned into a parallel world will display supernatural powers!
I'll mow these guys down and make them fuel for my shining future!
You lumps of EXP!
That's the first time I ever hit someone!
I didn't expect it to hurt me that much...
But this world is set up so that I'll be strong!
My adrenaline is surging! I've got this!
I'm sorry! It was all my fault! Forgive me! Spare me!
Play games with us, will you?! Die, scum!
And don't think it'll be painless!
That's enough.
Who the hell are you?!
Stop now, and I'll let this slide.
So just graciously return what you stole.
What we stole?
Now, please. It's important to me.
I'll give up on the other stuff, but I can't let you have that.
Be good and hand it over, please.
You didn't come to save this kid?
What strange clothes he has...
If you asked me whether I had any connection to him, I'd have to say no.
Then you've got no business with us!
If someone stole from you, it was that brat who just ran by!
Yeah! That way! She ran that way!
Hmm... They don't seem to be lying...
I need to go after her!
But regardless of that...
I can't overlook what's going on here.
Magic?
Mess with us, will you?!
I don't care if you can use magic! I'll kill you!
You think you can win when it's two against one?! Huh?!
You're right. Two against one may be unfair.
Two against two should make it fair, then.
You're a user of the spiritual arts?
Correct. Back off now and I won't come after you.
Decide quick. I'm in a hurry.
You bitch! Next time I see you, I won't go easy on you!
Do anything to her, and I'll haunt you and your kin forever.
Not that you'll have any kin if I do that.
You saved me. Thanks.
Don't move.
See? You averted your eyes because you have a guilty conscience!
Looks like my judgment was spot-on.
Are you sure?
I think it was just an instinctive male reaction.
I didn't sense any malice at all.
You be quiet, Puck.
You know who stole my insignia from me, don't you?
Uh, sorry, but I don't have the slightest idea.
Huh? Wait, it can't be!
Did I really just come around the long way?
You should probably hurry after her, miss.
I could... help...
Aww, you shouldn't have tried to get up.
What should we do?
It's none of our business.
He won't die. We'll just leave him.
Really?
Yes, really.
You say that, but I bet you'll still help him.
I will not!
Yeah, right.
Absolutely not! I am not going to save him!
She's even super cute when she's mad.
That's a parallel world fantasy for you...
Is my head on someone's lap?
You're awake?
I didn't know cute girls were this hairy...
Wait, that can't be right!
It's just a thoughtful arrangement we made
so you could at least feel happy until you woke up.
First of all, don't talk in that high voice!
No sane guy confuses a cat for the main heroine!
Aww, making myself bigger was worth it to see you so happy.
I'm not happy!
I'm sorry about this.
You stayed with me the whole time I was unconscious...
Don't get the wrong idea.
I had to stay because there are things I want to ask you.
Healing your wounds and making Puck your pillow until you woke up
were for my own benefit.
So I need you to repay me in kind.
For such a normal favor, you're making it sound like I really owe you big.
No such thing.
You have some idea who stole my insignia, right?
Insignia?
You mean one of those badge things that shows your affiliation?
It has a jewel in the center,
and it's about this big.
Sorry, but no matter how many times you ask me, I have no idea.
I see. No helping that, then.
But you've given me the information that you know nothing,
and you gave me my answer, in return for healing you.
Huh?
Well, I'm in a hurry, so I'm going now.
Your wounds should be better now,
but next time, don't do dangerous things, like wandering into deserted alleys alone.
I'm not concerned. I'm just warning you.
If that happens to you again, saving you won't be of any benefit to me,
so don't expect me to help.
Sorry about her. She's so insincere.
Don't think badly of her.
Insincere?
I think this goes beyond that.
She was in such a hurry to find what was stolen from her,
yet she stopped to help me.
And she even came up with that lame excuse for a favor so I wouldn't feel like I owed her,
even though I'm a total stranger.
Anyone who lives like that...
is gonna end up wasting their whole life!
Hey! Wait up!
What? Just so you know, I can only spend just a little more time with you.
I sense you're being a tiny bit lenient...
Forget that. You lost something important, right?
Let me help you.
But you said you don't know anything...
But I remember her face, at least!
If I see her again, I'll know!
You're very strange...
Just so you know, I can't do anything to thank you.
I don't need you to.
I want to thank you. That's why I want to help.
I didn't do anything deserving of thanks.
I told you, I've already received compensation for healing your wounds.
Then...
I'm going to help you for my own sake, too.
My objective is... Let's see...
Yeah! One good deed per day!
I don't sense any malice. I think you can just accept his offer.
The more shields between yourself and ruffians, the better, after all.
That's what you want me around for?!
I mean it, though. I can't do anything to thank you.
No problem. Just leave it to me!
I talked big, but isn't this town too huge to find one little thing in?
It's the capital of Lugunica.
You didn't even know that, um...
That's right. We haven't asked your name yet.
Should we all introduce ourselves?
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'll introduce myself first, then.
My name is Natsuki Subaru.
Not only am I clueless, I'm also broke beyond compare!
Nice to meet ya!
When that's all you say, you really do sound hopeless.
And I'm Puck! Nice to meet you!
It's very unusual to see someone who can touch a spirit so casually.
Where are you from?
Well, following the usual pattern, a small island nation to the east.
Lugunica is the easternmost nation on our continental map.
There's no nation east of here.
No way, really? There's nothing east of here?
You have no idea where you are, you have no money,
you can't read, and you have no one who can help you.
You might be in an even more precarious position than me, um...
Subaru... was it?
Yes, that's my name.
But when I look at you this way, you look pretty well-built.
I do work out every day.
For a shut-in who's gotta guard his house, that much is a given.
I'm not sure I understand what a shut-in is,
but that means you're from a respectable family, right?
H-Hey
Your fingers, too. They're very pretty.
They're evidence that you don't live like a peasant at all.
And your muscles don't look like the kind you gain by working.
Uh, anyway, I know your cat's name now,
but I haven't heard yours yet.
My name?
Yeah.
I'm...
Satella.
I have no family name. You can just call me Satella.
I see... Satella...
That's a nice name.
You have terrible taste.
Okay, time to get back to asking around!
Hey, Subaru...
Do you get the feeling that child is lost?
Uh, but what about our questioning?
That's important too, but if she's lost, we have to do something.
I'm in no place to talk after you saved me,
but do you understand the position we're in?
But...
She's crying! Is she not, Subaru?
If you can't do this with me, that's fine.
Thanks for all your help, Subaru.
I'll handle it on my own from here,
after I help that little girl.
I'm sorry I'm not who you were looking for.
So, what's the matter?
Aren't your mom and dad with you?
Um, uh... Don't cry...
I won't do anything to you, okay?
What I have here is one grooved-edge ten-yen coin.
I will now clutch it tightly in my hand.
Tight, tight, tight... like that!
And now... Imagine that!
And this... is where the coin was hiding.
You can have this.
It's rare, so take good care of it.
Thank you!
I see. You got separated from your mom, huh?
Hey, it'll be fine.
Just leave it to me and this young lady here.
We'll find them for you in no time.
When we do this,
people who don't know us probably think we're a married couple and child, huh?
How embarrassing.
At best, I can't see you as anything more than her older brother.
What makes you think I'm that much younger than you?!
Oh! Mommy!
Mommy!
Looks like she found her.
Yeah. I'm glad.
So...
I think we took a pretty long way around,
but what benefit will you insist that you got out of this?
That's easy. Now we can continue our search with our minds at ease, right?
Anyway, why did you help me?
You were against the idea.
I could say I just wanted to show off my magic trick,
but that would be a lie.
I told you, finding your insignia will be my one good deed for the day!
Then, since you helped the little girl, isn't your one good deed over?
That comeback was way too logical!
Come on, it doesn't hurt to do more than one nice thing in a day, right?
I just got tomorrow's out of the way.
My plan is to get a week's worth of good deeds taken care of early!
Subaru, you're the type that basically wastes your whole life, aren't you?
You're the last one I want saying that to me.
You're not a bad boy, though.
Why are you treating me like I'm younger than you again?
I doubt there's that much difference between us.
I don't think making guesses on that will help you.
I'm a half-elf.
Now I get it.
No wonder I thought you were so cute!
Elves are always beautiful, right?
What?
What? Well, I mean... I'm a half-elf...
Yeah, I heard you.
What'd you do that for?
I just had to do something about this unbearable tingle I feel!
I can't accept being hit for a reason like that.
Though I'll forgive you because it was squishy.
I didn't hit you out of anger or anything.
The opposite, in fact.
Subaru, you're such a dunderhead!
Dunderhead? Who says that in this day and age?
And why are you insulting me?
Hmph! Whatever!
More importantly, we have to get back to the search.
Hey, hang on!
Running around without a plan never ends well.
There's a basic rule of searches.
A basic rule of searches?
Yep. You revisit the crime scene a hundred times.
Where was your insignia stolen?
So you see, it seems the crime happened right around here,
so I came back to this fruit stand after valiantly telling her to leave it all to me.
What? I thought I had a customer, but it's just the broke kid?
Do you really want to take that attitude?
Haven't you noticed I'm not who I was before?
What?
Just look who I brought with me!
I brought someone who just might become a regular!
Um, Subaru...
You seem to have some weird expectations of me,
but I don't have any money, either.
Huh?! Seriously?
So what did you want to say to me now that I've got two broke customers, boy?
We're actually looking for someone,
and we hoped we could ask you some questions...
That was a sarcastic way of telling you I don't have time for losers with no money!
Get outta here!
Mister!
Thanks for your help earlier.
What brings you back here?
It's my husband's shop, so we were just stopping by.
Husband?
Hey, there's my girl.
Wait, you know these broke losers?
She got lost, and they found her.
Here, lady.
Please accept it.
She wants to thank you in her own way.
Thank you.
Sorry about that.
You helped my daughter, and I want to thank you.
You can ask for anything.
There, you see?
That came back around and worked in our favor!
The air, the atmosphere, and most likely,
the attitudes of the people living here are awful.
Are you sure she's here?
It might be that Felt girl.
You said a nimble little blond girl, right?
She's well-known in the slums. Dunno where she lives, though.
Maybe someone will tell us if we ask.
No one would sell out one of their own, so I don't think that would work.
Maybe we should come back later.
Whether you stay or leave, you should decide quickly.
I'm almost out of time.
You're what? Out of time?
I have a cute appearance, but I am a spirit.
It take a lot of mana just to appear in physical form.
So at night, I return to the crystal I was summoned from
and prepare for the emergence of the sun.
On average, my ideal staying time is from about nine to five.
Nine to five? You sound like a civil servant.
Employment terms for spirits are more severe than I thought...
We'll be fine without Puck. We have to move forward.
Yeah. But, sorry... I'm at my limit...
It's almost like he's dying when he disappears...
Sorry to work you so hard, Puck.
We'll handle things from here, so get some rest.
Don't do anything reckless.
If it comes down to it, use the odo to summon me again.
Okay, take care of the rest, Subaru.
Hey, I haven't been alone with a girl since I was in grade school!
Don't get any weird ideas.
I can use magic.
I won't!
The bigger issue is how we should find Felt now.
I'll ask the lesser spirits.
Lesser spirits?
Lesser spirits are beings that haven't become spirits yet.
They grow over time, and when they gain strength and self-awareness,
they become full spirits, like Puck.
