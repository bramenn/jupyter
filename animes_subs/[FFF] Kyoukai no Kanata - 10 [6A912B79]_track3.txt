Kuriyama-san?
Senpai?
You're awake?
So that's what happened?
Right!
Things got pretty intense after you transformed.
But on the bright side, you didn't hurt anyone.
I see.
I think the Calm has something to do with that.
Your injuries still haven't completely healed.
You know, I was told that you would actually die if I attacked you during the Calm!
I was such a nervous wreck!
Don't go playing with it!
It should heal right up as soon as the Calm passes.
I'm not against trying new things, but I need to know what they are first.
It's a rice omelette!
A rice omelette?!
Yes. When I asked Mitsuki-senpai what to make, she said that you love rice omelettes.
Where's the egg?
Right here.
Boiled?!
It was that or nothing!
I was down to the very last one!
The last one?
How many did you use?
They're all gone!
Wh-What's that?
It's to celebrate your recovery. Sakura
Who celebrates with this?!
And you can't just rummage through my fridge just because I'm unconscious!
Or put a pig head in there!
You just focus on getting sleep, Senpai.
I'll run to the store and make you another one.
Why?
Why? Well...
What's wrong?
Nothing! It's just...
Are you truly that oblivious?
Sakura?!
When did you get here?
Ever since you fell unconscious, Mirai has been taking care of you.
She never once left your side.
You still don't get it?
Get what?
Mirai, he may be a lost cause.
What are you trying to say?!
What exactly are you trying to say?!
You should just tell him, plain and simple.
What?! Tell him what?!
What are you two
It's hot!
Th-That's because it's summer now.
Summer, huh?

Good morning, Senpai!
It's pretty cold today, isn't it?
Where's Sakura?
She said she was going on ahead.
It's summer vacation, all right.
But when I texted Mitsuki-senpai a minute ago, she said that she was at school.
You brought in more?
Y-You must be imagining things.
Besides, I don't have the money to buy more bonsai stuff.
Oh, I got a text from Sakura.
So this is where you were!
Oh, glasses!
How strange.
I could have sworn I heard Akihito's voice.
Am I hearing things?
This is great!
There is no denying that sunglasses aren't as effective as regular glasses,
but by placing a girl who rarely wears glasses or swimsuits into a situation
This is one talkative ghost!
Ghost?
Akihito kicked the bucket about two weeks ago.
Looking back, you've gotta feel sorry for the guy.
They say that the more beloved you are, the shorter your life is.
But Akihito didn't fit into that saying at all!
He was hated, scorned, and treated like a nuisance...
all the way to his dying breath.
I'm not dead.
Yup, you're Akihito.
In that case, you'd better make yourself scarce.
Letting you see me in a bikini for free is nothing less than degrading.
I never asked you to put on a swimsuit!
Sheesh...
Akihito.
What now?
Learn from this experience and take a good, hard look at yourself.
I've had all I can take...
of nightmares like that.
Right.
While you're at it, drag that pervert to the clubroom with you.
Hey, pervert.
What is it, pervert?
The snow isn't letting up, is it?
Ow!
Ouch...
Senpai?
Senpai!
Wait!
Please wait, Senpai!
Wait...
Please!
The days keep getting shorter, don't they?
Well, the summer solstice was a while ago.
Wanna read for a bit longer?
I'm fine.
Hiromi and Mitsuki sure are taking their sweet time.
They already went home.
Seriously?!
And here I am, finally back after slipping between life and death.
Don't you think that's exactly why they left?
I bet it feels awkward for them to face you!
What is it?
Uh, it's nothing.
Kuriyama-san, are you free?
See, I was thinking we could go out to eat or something.
Ah, I can cover for you if you're short on cash.
O-Okay.
I mean, I don't know what really happened,
but I'm sure I must have put you through a lot.
I wish you had asked me earlier.
Is that a No?
Yes.
This will probably be over once the sun goes down.
What do you mean?
Senpai...
Senpai, why are you always so nice to me?
I feel like the two of us are alike in a few ways.
If I said that, Kuriyama-san, would you get
You got a problem with that?!
I-I wouldn't say that!
Your disgust is written all over on your face!
D-Did that make you happy?
How would that make me happy?!
Well, Mitsuki-senpai told me that you get immense pleasure
from people stepping all over you.
I'm having a hard time mastering her techniques, though.
You don't need to master that!
Please forget what Mitsuki told you!
No!
I won't forget.
I will not forget.
What's that?
That's you, Senpai.
That's Beyond the Boundary.
It is a collection of people's warped hearts.
It's said that it will destroy the world.
And... it was a demon that resided inside of you.
That was inside of...
I originally came to this town to defeat Beyond the Boundary.
But things didn't go according to plan.
I couldn't bring myself to kill you.
I didn't want to kill you.
That's why...
I was told that if I used the power of my blood during the Calm,
I could force Beyond the Boundary to leave your body.
I desperately wanted to do that.
What happened... to Kuriyama-san?
She vanished.
Th-Then...
Who are you, the Kuriyama-san sitting here in front of me?
Senpai, you still haven't regained consciousness.
This is all part of a dream.
A tiny bit of my blood is still inside of you, causing you have this dream.
But the dream is about to come to an end.
Senpai, you're going to actually wake up soon.
Kuriyama-san...
I thought I could do it since this is a dream.
It really is hard, isn't it?
Farewell.
Just a dream?

Kuriyama Mirai-san?
It is a pleasure to meet you.
I am Nase Izumi.
This is Kuriyama Mirai.
She is the legitimate heir to the cursed blood and an Exterminator.
She's from the clan that is abhorred by most Exterminators?
Yes.
Kuriyama-san.
She attacks by manipulating her own blood.
She is able to shape and harden her blood.
It is also a potent poison capable of destroying her opponent's internal organs.
Will that be enough to defeat it?
It is still too soon to say for certain.
However, I believe she stands a good chance.
Isn't her target said to be immortal?
Yes.
It's immortal?
I believe it simply has tremendously fast regenerative capabilities.
The immortal half-demon.
That is what the local Exterminators call it.
The immortal half-demon?
Here is what it looks like.
Unlike those possessed by a demon,
this dangerous creature is the inconceivable mix of a half-human and a half-demon.
Upon researching it,
I found that its demon half is Beyond the Boundary.
When my younger brother tried to subdue it, the creature retaliated.
His wounds put him on the brink of death.
You are the only person I can turn to.
Please.
That's Beyond the Boundary.
This person must...
Does the Exterminator's Society know about any of this?
It's possible.
I will offer her my full support.
I'm sorry you had to attend that stifling meeting with me back there.
With all the history behind this area, there are bound to be many customs.
Bonsai?
Yes. Anyway...
Yes?
Where is Beyond the Boundary?
Don't worry.
I'm making sure it's kept under close observation.
In the end, I'm going to have to kill it, right?
If that's the case, I'd like to hurry.
Are you up to it?
How am I supposed to know if I can do it?!
Earlier you said
No.
I was asking if you are mentally prepared for this.
I heard about what happened with Inami Yui.
My condolences.
After the way the Exterminators persecuted you,
I know I'm asking for a lot.
You don't need to apologize to me.
The half-demon's name is Kanbara Akihito.
It is a second year high school student.
You
I-I was too much for you.
Uh...
Say...
Do you think you could do something about this?
Pretty please?
Is he really all that dangerous?
Why are you so hung up on me?
Then why don't you quit being an Exterminator?
If I could quit, I would have a long time ago!
But the cursed blood running through my veins isn't normal!
This power is...
I'm the same way.
Why did you have to say that?
Why?

So as we predicted, his immortality is preventing you from finishing him off through normal means?
That's correct.
You should watch him for a while.
Attacking at random will get you absolutely nowhere.
But...
Just like when Hiromi faced him,
Beyond the Boundary is sure to overtake the body eventually, even if it is only temporary.
That is when you should strike.
Understood.
Also...
I am saying this as a friendly warning.
You should distance yourself from Akihito-kun.
Oh, right! Kuriyama-san!
Y-Yes?
About what I said yesterday. What do you think?
I'm inviting you to come visit the Literary Club.
Sound good?
You haven't joined any other clubs,
and there aren't all that many Exterminators at our school.
Plus you just got here, so
I believe I already turned that offer down.
Wait!
Please don't come with me.
Despite what I said...
Why did you follow me, anyway?
Because you're a bespectacled beauty!
Stab me!
I'm immortal, so...
I was only ever thinking about myself.
Senpai has friends who are there for him.
So...
That's why I thought you weren't anything like me.
live!
Senpai!
Farewell.
But I didn't know anything about you or your life.
I had no idea how much you had been suffering
or how hard life had been on you.
I have to stop you!
And then, I...

You couldn't kill him?
I believe I told you to distance yourself from Akihito-kun.
The Hollow Shadow's possession had clearly weakened Beyond the Boundary.
You wasted the perfect opportunity to defeat it.
Are you happy?
If we allow Beyond the Boundary to roam free,
it will use its massive power to destroy the world.
When that happens, there will be no second chances.
Right.
Goodbye.
I've been thinking about it ever since then.
And I realized that being indecisive won't get me anywhere.
I have no choice but to annihilate SenpaiBeyond the Boundary.
But I don't want to kill him!
I do not want to kill him.

The Calm is coming.
The Calm?
I have a plan.
Care to explain?
Very well.
First, I shall place Kanbara Akihito in a frozen barrier
and weaken his human half.
The Calm will have also weakened Beyond the Boundary, which I will draw out.
I will then tell Kuriyama Mirai that if she takes advantage of the Calm,
there is a way to save Kanbara Akihito without killing him.
Kill him.
Considering Kuriyama Mirai's current mental state,
I am certain she will believe me.
However, the Exterminator's Society is bound to come in pursuit of Beyond the Boundary as well.
I swear that we will annihilate it before they do.
Is what you said in the text all true?
Yes. Seeing as it's a demon,
even Beyond the Boundary will be weakened during the Calm.
If you use your body along with all of your blood,
you should be able to remove Beyond the Boundary from the body
without killing Akihito-kun.
However, that means Beyond the Boundary will violate your entire body.
But Senpai won't have to die that way, right?
You've already made up your mind, haven't you?
I have.
This is where you will find Akihito-kun.
He will awaken sooner or later.
If you truly wish to save Akihito-kun, you had better act quickly.
Kuriyama-san...
Akihito-kun wants you to live.
He wants you to kill him so that you may live.
I'm absolutely sure that's what he would want.
I bet.
Regardless, you're going to rescue Akihito-kun, aren't you?
Yes.
I know that Senpai is going to be angry with me.
When he hears about what I did, he'll say that I didn't understand anything.
Just like he did back then...
Well, he doesn't either!
The snow is starting to pick up.
That must be Beyond the Boundary's core.
