Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Laxus started the Battle of Fairy Tail,
a fierce struggle against rune traps and the Raijin Tribe.
And now the only people left are Natsu and Gajeel who, for some reason, can't get out!
But Erza's back, and Mystogan arrived in town as well!
Although I'm still stoned...
You are good, Erza...
I never thought you would challenge me...
If I defeat you, then everyone will return to normal!
I wonder if you can?
That won't work!
I see!
I didn't know you had an artificial eye.
In that case... Fairy Machine Gun Leprechaun!
Take this!
Wait!
So you can actually defend against this many needles?
Impressive.
But I wonder how you'll handle twice as many!
For today henceforth, I will be known as Titania!
For I am the true Fairy Queen!
You must be joking!
Thunder Palace!
Even someone like you is still a fellow Fairy Tail wizard.
If you want to call yourself Titania, then feel free.
I do not know who gave me that nickname in the first place anyway.
If you cease this foolishness and return everyone to normal, I will not harm you.
Aren't you being a bit naive here?
My Stone Eyes have another power.
Remote control.
Now, bow down before me!
If you do not, I can turn those stone women into piles of rubble from here!
Oh?
So you value victory over your life?
That's very admirable of you.
I will purify the souls of those turned to dust with your very life.
Now that's how you bluff.
I give...
What happened to Juvia?
We're...
They're back to normal!
Lucy!
What?
Erza vs. Evergreen. Winner: Erza.
Excellent work!
The hostages have been freed!
Now what will you do, Laxus?
Worthless trash!
How could Eve lose to the likes of Erza?
Since when did you get so weak, Eve?
Erza is too strong.
This was a job for Bickslow or myself.
Why have you returned, Freed?
Because the game is over.
With the hostages freed, the master will no longer budge.
Laxus!
It's not over.
If you won't follow me, then get lost.
You aren't needed in my Fairy Tail.
Battle of Fairy Tail?
Laxus did what?
Well, it's over now.
With you all returned to normal,
there's no way I'm going to play Laxus's silly game any more.
But, what about everyone that was injured from Freed's traps?
That's right!
If we don't teach Laxus a lesson, he'll never learn!
And don't I know it!
I'll give him a punishment he'll never forget!
Damn you, Laxus...
You're not going to get away with it this time!
Wait a second.
I have to agree with Laxus about the whole deciding who the strongest in Fairy Tail is thing.
So don't be so hard on the guy, Gramps.
Natsu...
You're such a...
So anyway... The second Battle of Fairy Tail starts now!
Bring it on, everyone!
What?!
Stop!
'Cause we haven't done anything yet!
Come on, let's battle!
Give it a rest already.
You're saying it like you're serious or something.
If you insist, I'll fight you.
Cana, don't encourage him.
Natsu... I don't think fighting women really counts as a battle.
Man, woman... Doesn't matter to me!
Whoa, that face is pissing me off!
Here I come, Lucy!
Cut it out!
What's the matter, Gajeel-kun?
It's nothing.
This guild sure is fun.
It's got a screw loose.
Huh? What's that?
What?
Is something happening again?
This time we'll be your opponents!
Can you hear me, old man?
Same goes for the rest of you.
Laxus!
Seems one of the rules is gone.
So I'll make a new rule now.
In order for the Battle of Fairy Tail to continue, I have activated the Thunder Palace.
Thunder Palace?!
You have one hour and ten minutes left.
So, can you defeat me?
Or will you retire, Master?
What are you thinking, Laxus?
You plan on getting innocent people involved in this?
Master!
Gramps!
What's wrong?
Oh, no!
Get his usual medicine!
And at a time like this...
Master, please hang in there!
What's this Thunder Palace thing?
Gramps...
Everyone look outside!
What are those?
Thunderbolt lacrima...
What are those things doing up there...
Huh?
Who knows. Must be those Fairy Tail guys up to something again.
I sure wish they'd cut it out already.
They must be preparing fireworks for the Harvest Festival, right?
Oh, I bet you're right!
Maybe those Fairy Tail guys are actually on the ball for once!
They're floating above the city.
Each of those lacrima stores a great deal of magical thunder energy.
So, this Thunder Palace is probably...
That's what the Thunder Palace means, then?
Now Magnolia is the target...
So what happens if those things discharge?
Countless thunderbolts will rain down on the city.
I won't let that happen!
Sniper Rifle Requip!
Target: Lock on!
Stinger Shoot!
Oh, I guess they aren't fireworks.
What are they doing?
All right!
Not bad, Bisca.
I'll get'em all like this!
Bisca!
Bisca!
What's happening?
Bisca!
Hey, what was that?
Was that because of...
I think they might be dangerous!
Hey, hang in there, Bisca!
Bisca, wake up!
What's this?
What happened?
It's Body Link Magic.
Body Link Magic?
Those lacrima are under a spell linked back to the one who destroys them,
inflicting equal damage to what they received.
In other words if you attack them, that same damage gets sent back to you.
Oh, no!
At this rate, the people in the city will...
We've got to beat Laxus!
Let's go!
I'll try and get the people of the city to evacuate!
I'll go, too!
There are still two of the Raijin Tribe left!
Be careful out there!
What are those?
Are they really fireworks?
Fairy Tail's gonna make a scene again, aren't they?
How about that, old man?
My next hostages are everyone in the entire city!
What is that bastard thinking?
Natsu!
I think you're going too far.
Too far?
This is going overboard!
I'll decide what's too far.
If you want to be master so bad, then fight Gramps yourself!
This is a fight to the finish!
Until one of us is wiped out, this battle won't end!
That's enough, Laxus!
Natsu, calm down!
This is no time to be calm!
Just listen.
Damn it!
There's another invisible wall here!
Runes, right?
We know that already.
It's one of the writing magics, so I might be able to help.
What?
Really, Levy?
I believe that you two can stop Laxus!
If I take the information from the arrangement of the rouge letters
and break it down to the letter materials,
I can pick up the vocabulary used to construct the rules...
L, O, S, U...
Then, changing it further to Gheel grammar...
Wow, you're amazing.
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
No!
L and S are bluffs!
The key-code is Als!
I-It is?
Don't worry.
I'll get you guys out of here.
You don't really have to...
Please.
Stop Laxus!
I wanna be doing something!
The Thunder Palace.
You'll go that far, Laxus?
What are you doing, Freed?
Bickslow is still out hunting Fairies, you know.
I'll handle the old man's best hope, Erza.
Mystogan as well.
You get Cana and that woman from Phantom.
I don't need either of them in my Fairy Tail.
Wipe them out.
Even if they're our enemies now, we're still in the same...
I thought I gave you an order!
After the path we've taken, there's no turning back.
I will follow you, even to the pits of hell.
I will accomplish my mission.
No more pulled punches.
Don't you have regrets, now.
That will do, Darkness Freed.
Now is the time to show me your true power.
According to Evergreen, Laxus is here in this building.
Laxus!
Erza-chan?
W-What's this?
This is the men's bath!
Did we win a prize or something?
Where is Laxus?
Lax...
She got me...
Damn it!
There's no sign of him!
Is there any other place you think Laxus could be?
I have known him a long time...
But right now, I guess you could say he's lost any perspective he had...
Why didn't you use the guild's loudspeakers?
The runes said that during the Battle of Fairy Tail only the master could use it.
They really did think of everything.
Anyway, we have to get the people of the city to evacuate away from the Thunder Palace!
Yeah, but I think it might be better not to.
Why?
There's a lot of people from outside Magnolia here for the Harvest Festival right now.
Everything's in chaos already.
But the people are looking up uneasily at those lacrima.
See, that's why if you tell them what they are, you're sure to cause a panic!
A ton of people will get injured!
But if I don't...
What should I do?
Yeah, what should you do?
Lucy, watch out!
What the heck?
Fairy Tail's at it again!
It's Bickslow!
Hey there!
So you're the newbie I've heard about?
Heard what about?
I'm not sure I even want to know!
The hot-headed princess who loves cosplay and meat!
Who comes up with these things?
So what's this? A cheerleader?
Cheer!
Cheer!
Cheer!
This is...
Cheer!
Cheer!
Cheer!
Hey, babies... Get her!
Sorry'bout this!
Normally I'd go easy'cause you're new,
but we got this game going on right now.
Do you really think the master will forgive you for doing that?
I don't need the master's forgiveness.
Because when this game is over, Laxus will be the master!
Those flying things are in the way.
Gate of the Archer, I open thee!
Sagittarius!
I am a horse!
Did you call? Moshimoshi.
Ooh, it's Celestial Magic!
Looks like your Spirit's into cosplay, too.
Um, no!
Aim for those flying things, okay?
Roger that, as it were! Moshimoshi.
Oh, my babies!
First you're frozen, and now you're dust!
All right!
As it were! Moshimoshi.
No... My babies...
If you want to surrender, now's your chance!
Now!
Moshimoshi!
Babies... Babies...
Babies...
Psych!
Sagittarius!
Moshimoshi...
I need to take a short break...
Oh, no!
There's a hobby shop under here.
It's got a treasure trove of dolls.
What are those?
No matter how many dolls you destroy, it does nothing to me, a manipulator of souls!
Souls?
Bickslow uses magic that lets him possess dolls with souls!
So then, this time...
My keys!
I'll get them back!
You can't retreat now.
Sorry'bout this, cosplay girly!
Offer your soul to Laxus!
Baryon Formation!
What is this?
Stop!
That's...
I wonder why...
It seems like only I can go through the gate freely regardless of your will.
Could it be that our love has shattered the barrier between man and spirit, perhaps?
Love?
What nonsense are you talking about?
You're... Loke!
The time has come to keep my promise, it seems.
Loke!
Loke! So you were a Spirit!
Here I never told anybody your secret, and now you turn on me?
He realized?
He can see people's souls!
Joining in for the Battle of Fairy Tail?
Huh?
I don't really care that much about what's going on.
I just won't allow you to harm my owner, Lucy, no matter what!
Not allow me?
Come on now, you've never beaten me.
And I was always holding back when we fought!
Rough'im up like the old times, my babies!
Lucy, stand back.
What are you saying?
Spirits aren't shields. I fight alongside them! That's my style!
You lllike him...
No, I don't!
I'll do something about the dolls.
When there's an opening, you go after Bickslow, Lucy!
Okay!
Let's go, Happy!
Aye!
Regulus, grant me power!
That time we laughed, saying we're both like each other,
we even kindly overlooked the little lies.
If we lose a place to go back to together, I don't care.
Because I'll protect that smile.
The meetings and partings numerous as the stars in the sky...
All the things I don't want to lose...
Right now I feel like I don't need any of them.
I just want to see you by my side,
all my happiness and sadness.
Let's start from here.
Let's start our tomorrow.
Let's do it like we've just been reborn.
Like flowers blown in a summer wind,
let us bloom brightly in this instant.
Natsu, you destroyed the request board again?
You'd better hurry and apologize to Mira, or...
D-D-Don't be stupid, Happy!
Don't you realize what'll happen if Mira gets angry for real?
Is she really that scary?
I won't get away with only 2 or 3 broken ribs, I just know it...
Every bone in my entire body, one at a time!
Aww, snap?
Next time: Satan's Decent
W-Well, I'm stronger than she is now.
Okay, then I'll go tell Mira,'kay?
H-Happy!
Wanna go get some fish instead?
