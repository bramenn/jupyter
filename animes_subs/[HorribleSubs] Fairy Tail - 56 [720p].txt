Oh, no! Jellal's been brought back to life!
But...
If you don't bring Wendy back soon, Erza's in real trouble!
Fast is good!
Natsu, I'll hold him here!
You hurry to Erza's side!
Fast is...
I heard ya the first time!
If it's love and dreams and you it'll become magical.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
I kind of admired this powerful world,
chock-full of problems.
Frozen time has started to move again
ever since I met you.
Why were we born? Why do we live?
I don't need any complicated answers.
Laugh! Cry! Be honest with yourself.
Simple feelings are the most important.
You can change those tears shed on sad nights into strength.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
The Worth Woodsea.
Deep inside it, there is a single man.
You okay, Happy?
Natsu, where are we?
Don't talk. Just rest there a little while.
But, Jellal...
Jellal...
That bastard! Why the hell is he here?
Natsu-kun!
What's wrong, Natsu?
Can you hear me?
That voice...
Dead Grand Prix!
Natsu-kun, can you hear me?
Who are you?
It's me. Hibiki, from Blue Pegasus.
Thank goodness. I was getting worried after not being able to contact anyone.
Oh! Where are you?
Not so loud. One of the enemy has very good hearing.
It's possible he could intercept our conversation.
That's why I'm speaking directly into your mind.
So, how are Wendy-chan and the cat?
They're here, although she's unconscious.
Happy's awake, though.
I see. Thank goodness.
Great job.
I'm going to upload an app directly into your head that'll guide you here.
The cat seems to have used too much magic and taken too much damage for me to connect...
Anyway, hurry back here.
Sure. What about an apple?
I don't get you.
Why have you been talking to yourself?
I don't really get it, but I have an apple in my head!
Wait! I totally know how to get to where Erza is!
It's like I've known all along!
I don't have any apples in my head!
Hurry, Natsu-kun.
You have to hurry... There's no time.
So, how did you tell Natsu where we are?
My magic, Archive, can compress information.
By compressing it, people can transfer information between each other more quickly.
I've never heard of magic like that before.
Using magic to convert information into data is a recent concept, you see.
I see.
Anyway, thank goodness Wendy is safe.
Just wait a little longer, Erza.
You can do it!
I'll protect you until Natsu comes back. I promise!
Hey! What are you smiling about at a time like this?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
Around that time...
Gray is confronting one of Oracion Seis, codenamed Racer.
You've stopped me twice now.
At this rate, my name will mean dirt.
Oh, is that so?
If I felt like it, it wouldn't be any trouble to catch up with those brats.
When did you...
But I won't feel satisfied until you're history.
I'll have plenty of time to catch up afterwards.
I don't think so, buddy!
Too slow!
Slow, slow, slow!
Damn it! I can't follow him with my eyes!
Even if you used up your magic power making this ice wall,
I hope you don't expect me to go easy on you.
Say that again, jerk!
Come at me as fast as you can!
Dead Grand Prix!
Start your engines!
What kind of noise is this?
Magic motorcycles!
What the hell? A ton of magic motorcycles?
The motor show from hell!
Dance.
You expect me to ride one of these things?!
These are machines made to match my own speed.
Slowpokes can't handle'em.
Well, this just got interesting!
This bucking bronco is mine!
Oh? Look at him go.
Thanks for equipping them with SE plugs!
In this world, there are many vehicles which use magical power as energy.
Among them, the magic four-wheelers and magic motorcycles are equipped with SE Plugs
in order to send magic power from the driver directly to the internal engine.
It's definitely tough to make sure I don't lose all my magic power with these things.
I don't got a choice.
Here I go!
Sounds like fun!
You're challenging me to a race?
There ain't no rules, so you'd better be prepared!
You've got some nice style for being a goody-two-shoes from an official guild!
Don't underestimate Fairy Tail!
Ice Make Lance!
You're still too slow!
Damn it, it's hard to aim!
Do you really have the speed to pass me?
High Side Rush!
Tires?
Not bad.
But the Dead Grand Prix has just gotten started!
There! Try getting past this!
Damn it, this is nuts!
What's the matter, hot stuff?
I can't lose! For Erza!
I wonder what the explosion was just now?
A newcomer?
No...
Lyon-sama, that's...
Oracion Seis!
Lyon!
Gray!
Perfect timing! Get on!
What?
Just get on already!
Lyon-sama?
Don't worry! Stay here on standby!
Standby?
What other choice do I have?
Gray, where's Wendy?
Don't worry. Natsu saved her.
I see. Impressive.
Anyway, can you get him? I can't use magic well while I'm drivin' this thing.
Well, you just watch real carefully.
I'll show you how creation magic is done!
Put your money where your mouth is!
Here I go.
Pitiful.
You still use both hands when you use creation magic?
Lyon... You're using two hands?
It's how Ul taught us, right?
Ice Make...
Eagle!
You get him?
No... There's no reaction.
Enough playing around.
Ice Make...
Ice Make...
Ape!
Hammer!
That's some speedy creation magic you have there.
Fast is good!
But you're not there yet!
You just can't catch up to my speed.
I can't hit him!
Calm yourself, Gray! He's at 4 o'clock!
If you concentrate, you can follow anyone!
Concentrate, huh?
Okay then...
Let's do this, Lyon!
Fire on my mark, and don't hold back!
Why did they strip? And damn, that was fast.
Why did he take off his clothes?
Is that also...love?
Now! 50 meters in front!
I see you!
Ice Geyser!
Snow Dragon!
Damn it!
He's sped up even faster!
What's the matter? I'm over here!
You'll never hit me with those attacks. Not in your entire life...
No one can keep up with my speed.
He's strong... Is this what Oracion Seis really is?
Now, I need to get around to finishing you off,
and bringing back that girl.
Lend me your ear, Gray.
I've found his weakness.
The results of the investigation are in.
About Oracion Seis?
It's possible that Brain was once part of the Bureau of Magic.
The Bureau of Magic? Then, what's his true identity?
That's still under investigation.
What worries me is the R-system, in other words, the Tower of Heaven.
This seems to have something to do with it.
I've got reports indicating that.
There's a connection to Jellal...
That's what you mean, right?
Yes.
But I don't know...
What's Brain trying to accomplish with magic?
It'll be okay.
Natsu and the others are on the scene.
So, I'm sure things will be fine.
I suppose so.
It would be nice if they don't destroy things any more than necessary, though...
That's what you're worried about?
Lyon-sama... What could he be talking about?
Having a strategy session? How pointless.
Understand?
What?!
Just like I said.
You are no longer needed!
Hey, Lyon!
Damn you!
Lyon-sama, what are you doing?
God damn it! Let me go, Lyon!
Don't give me this crap!
Just stay up there and watch, Gray!
Turning on your friend? That's harsh, man...
Please, don't get me wrong.
He's not my friend.
We just happened to have the same teacher.
That's all.
Why, you...
But Lyon-sama...
No complaining!
Lamia Scale will be bagging this one!
Let's go, Sherry!
Uh, sure.
That overconfidence isn't going to help your chances.
Well, your chances were zero to begin with anyway...
Yap-yap-yap, little doggy!
Doll Attack, Rock Doll!
Nice power, but it lacks speed!
Slow, slow!
I can't see!
In that case... Wood Doll!
You can't catch me with magic like that!
Then how about this, I wonder?
Oh, crap!
He slipped out?
You're slow!
What are you, slow in the head?
Oh, that's rich.
You're the one that's slow in the head!
Your weak point is the weakness of your attacks!
No matter how fast you are, you can't seal the deal!
Ice Make Hedgehog!
Close in on me, and you're shish kebab...
So what'll you do?
Come at me with that speed you're so proud of!
Such a fool you are...
Gear Change... Red Zone!
Now that was my top speed.
You think I'd be serious at first against weaker opponents like you?
Really?
I'm not done yet!
Hey now...
Where do you think you're going?
Lyon-sama...
What happened to that momentum you had at first?
Well, you are damn tenacious...
How far is he going?
Ice Make Eagle!
Don't you understand that you can't hit me?
Hey, what's wrong? You think you can stop me with that, huh?
You said that I don't have any way to seal the deal with you.
Well, since you asked...
This should do nicely.
As long as I have the speed, I can get you first, before you have a chance to use magic.
Well, there's nothing wrong with being a bit arrogant when you're young.
But you were up against the wrong dude.
I'm one of Oracion Seis.
Six Generals. Six Prayers.
Six Pillars that will never crumble.
Only death awaits those who rock the pillars.
As I thought.
When I saw the birds flying by so fast in the sky, I figured out how your magic really works.
Your magic doesn't increase your own speed.
It lowers the speed of your opponents...
Or more accurately, it slows down their sense of time in a certain area.
In other words, you slow me down.
And since the magic only affects a certain area,
when someone sees you from outside your range...
They can take away your speed!
That's why you had me get so far away from him?
I see... I see it all!
But at that range... There's no way he'll hit!
Oh, he'll hit.
It doesn't matter how far away he is!
'Cause there's nothing stronger than a member of Fairy Tail
and the strength of their passion!!
Super Freeze Arrow!
It's fast!
My prayer...
To be faster than anyone... To be faster...
You did it, Lyon.
We still got five more of these guys.
I actually thought you two were fighting back there!
I'd expect nothing less from the older pupil.
Can you stand?
Don't make fun of me.
It's not over!
I swear on the name Oracion Seis, if I go down in defeat, I'll take you with me!
That's...
An explosive lacrima...
You bastard... Are you planning on...
One man, one kill!
Why, you...
Crap... Why do I have to run out of magic power now?
Lyon!
Lyon-sama!
Sheesh...
The things I do for you, younger pupil...
Lyon!
Lyon-sama!
Lyon!
Racer is... gone?
One corner of the Six Generals has broken?
I underestimated our enemy!
I never thought I would have to wake him up...
Midnight!
Awake?
Get rid of every last one of them.
Yes... Father.
I sure wish I could breathe fire...
What's this all of a sudden?
'Cause I could fry fish, or light up dark places... It's handy!
Then why don't you try eating my flames?
It might let you use breath attacks!
Cats aren't good with hot food, so I'll pass.
Next time: Darkness.
Just try eating it, sheesh!
There's at least a chance, right?
I guess you're right. Let's see here...
Here.
