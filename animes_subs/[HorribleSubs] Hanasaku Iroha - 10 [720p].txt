Again, huh?
Episode 10 Slight Fever
I hear Ohana's been
getting up really early these past few days.
Yeah, when I arrive in the morning,
the entrance is already clean.
She's taking the initiative to clean early every day, huh...
Yes.
Even the duckboards, the window frames, and the wooden floors.
By herself?!
Oh, and she cleans the front desk, too.
And you didn't stop her?
I didn't want to take the fight out of her.
So, why was she collapsed on the hallway...?
No idea.
Umm...
Anyway, let's let her rest for a while.
Yeah.
Okay.
How was she?
She was asleep.
Has her fever gone down?
The doctor said that her fever
might stay a bit for the rest of the day.
Oh...
But apparently, after she rests for the entire day,
she should be able to work tomorrow.
Oh...
She was just overworked, he says.
Oh...
She's been working really hard lately.
Perhaps I should cook something for her.
Minko, have Tohru teach you more about broiling.
Okay!
Rice porridge, maybe?
Here.
Give it back!
Try and get it back.
How about something like this?
What?!
First, the Madam Manager, and now, one of the waitresses?!
What's wrong with this inn?!
Listen, Saturday is an important day for the Kissuiso!
Taking care of your own body is a part of being a professional!
Well, umm...
Yes?
Ohana was working hard for the sake of Kissuiso...
What?
Even though this inn is small,
you need to put effort into risk management-
Right, risk management.
Risk management is a very important skill.
Thankfully, the Madam Manager was ill the other day,
which led to a good experi-
I mean, a very unfortunate event.
So even you have something
good to say every once in a while, Miss Kawajiri.
So you were listening, Mom?
Madam Manager.
I have no hidden agenda.
That's right.
We shouldn't let what we learned the
other day go to waste.
What we learned the other day?
To do your job accurately.
Oh.
Yup.
Serial TV Drama The Hotel King
That's for the Moon Room, right?
Could you bring two bottles
of oolong tea and two cups to the Wave Room?
Even though it's your first time doing it yourself,
you've watched me broil fish before, right?
Yes.
Then go for it.
Yes.
Yo.
The customers in the
Camellia Room don't need chicken, right?
Yup, that's right.
Hey, we don't need that much fire!
I'm sorry.
This is how it's done.
Demon Disturbance?
What?
Nothing.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Anyway, I'm sorry to ask you of this
when you're still a bit sick,
but I was hoping you might be willing to listen to my new work.
Did you know that there's a theory that
hearing sexual words
invigorates your brain and makes you livelier?
Okay, here we go.
The Wet Madam Manager at the Gambling Den.
This is how it begins, but...
Is this supposed to be a get-well visit
to a sick person's room, Mr. Jiromaru?
The red lanterns reflect upon the lustrous canal.
On the back of the woman who held
two dice and a jar in her hand
were two more dice. Snake eyes.
The shades and stray hair that go
from those pink shoulders to her nape.
The portion between the bottom of her kimono
and her white socks caught the attention of the men.
Excuse me...
Is the Madam Manager supposed to be the model for this?
Crane Room... sandwich... with ham...
Yes...?
Oh, you can get up now?
Making me cook food for sick people...
It might still be hot, so be careful.
It's delicious...
Of course it is.
There's no other sick person food in
the world with such good broth.
Yeah.
Wow, strawberries...
Oh, those are from Minko.
You've still got a fever, right?
Let me feel your forehead.
I-I'm not really sure.
Maybe I'm also a bit feverish.
I added ham for the sandwiches for the Crane Room.
That's what you'd asked for, right?
Oh well.
You're okay now, Ohana?!
Nakochi.
Well, I need to be getting to work.
Sick people don't need to think of such things!
What?
What do you mean, what?
See?
You're still not well enough to work.
You need to sleep.
It's cold and good.
Right?
This is what we always feed my brothers
whenever they have a fever.
The younger one
catches colds on purpose just to eat this.
Nakochi.
You're like an older sister.
I really am an older sister.
I need to be working, too.
It's fine.
We're doing fine without you.
Tomoe and I ran everything together
before you came here, remember?
Get well soon, okay?
I'll stop by later to check up on you.
The Kissuiso can run without me?
How many times have
I been escorted back to my bed today...
You should get
the hint that we want you to rest, then.
Her nape...
her stray hair...
What was the other one?
The portion between her skirt and her socks?
Ko...
Come home, Ohana.
The Kissuiso will be fine without you.
Ko...
Send Text To: Ko Ko. Ko, I think I'm going to
Rice porridge with broth, huh?
Minko, you still have the fish bones you separated this morning?
Yes.
She looked like she was really enjoying the rice porridge,
so I figured we might be able to serve it to the customers.
Oh yeah,
Minko.
I think she liked your strawberries... too...?
It needs some minor adjustments.
Let's do this.
Right.
To: Ko I can't really move my body very well. Your body was glowing. Kissuiso has good staff, and it's not like an ordinary person like me can just take a position here.
Could you bring this fruit medley and guide map
to the Wisteria Room?
Okay.
Nako.
Yes?
Are you okay?
I don't want you to overwork yourself too.
I'm fine.
I need to pick up Ohana's slack, too.
Because, remember? Before she got here,
us two were doing everything.
So you're saying you don't need Ohana anymore, huh?
You've grown up, Nako.
Th-That's not what I...
Please enjoy your stay.
Say...
What happened to the waitress from yesterday?
I haven't been seeing her around.
Oh, Ohana isn't feeling very well right now.
Oh, so her name is Ohana.
She just has a slight fever.
You shouldn't worry too much.
You two make such a good team.
You seem to like each other so much.
And you're both so lively,
that it makes breakfast taste even better.
Thank you!
That was a good bath.
Yeah, I feel refreshed!
Look, I'm all wrinkly!
Wow!
What are you being so scared for?!
I-I'm sorry!
You touch the fish too much.
You need to minimize that.
I'm sorry.
Minchi!
It's too early in the morning to be yelling.
I-I'm sorry!
What's up, Nako?
Ohana collapsed!
What?!
Minchi...
You looked like you were really enjoying your sleep.
I feel a bit more relieved.
You were worried about me?
Don't worry, the inn is running okay.
What? What's wrong?!
I'm glad...
The Kissuiso can run without me, right?
No-
No.
That's not true.
Huh?
It's not true.
You tried to get rid of the bat in the hall
to the bath by yourself, didn't you?
Madam Manager told you girls to get rid of it.
You girls refers to you, Nako, and I.
Nako can't stand bats, so it's up to us.
You can't do everything by yourself!
But I can't do it by myself, either.
I need your help.
Okay?!
Once you're better,
we need to think of a plan to get rid of the bat!
O-Okay.
Ohana? I'm coming in.
You're here, Minchi.
Don't turn the TV on.
Huh?
But isn't it lonely when you wake up
and you don't hear any voices?
I've got a large family,
so it's really lonely for me.
Hey, the customers in the
Wisteria Room said that breakfast served
by you is really good.
Come on!
You shouldn't be playing with your
phone when you've got a fever.
To: Ko I can't really move my body very well. Your body was glowing. Kissuiso has good staff, and it's not like an ordinary person like me can just take a position here. This place should be fine without
Huh?
What's...
No!
That's not true, Ohana!
There are times I honestly feel like
we can't afford to lose anyone!
But today, you were out, and for some miraculous reason,
things weren't hectic and our jobs were done.
I hope this isn't the end of the world or something.
But, but, it doesn't mean
that we don't need that person!
It means that since that person is so important to us,
we work harder to fill in her gap!
So we really want that person back!
Sorry.
Geez...
Looks like she didn't hear you.
Huh?
Huh?
W-What?
Have you decided?
I love this place.
I love the Kissuiso.
I see.
I love everyone here.
Okay.
What ya doin'?
Ohana went looking for a fight?!
Ohana!
Help me...
Help me, Ko!
