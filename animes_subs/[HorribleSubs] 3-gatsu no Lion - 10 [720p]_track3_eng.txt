Something Given (Part 1)
December.
When Christmas was approaching,
I got another call from my foster sister, Kyouko.
You forgot something? A watch?
Here it is.
Thank goodness. Gotou just gave it to me.
He gets mad if I don't wear it.
Hey, I might have gotten a cold.
And it's your fault!
I told you to wait at the Mec in front of the station.
Forget it, that place is way too noisy.
Why couldn't I have gone to your place?
Why?
How about I guess what you were just thinking? Rei...
I'm just joking. You look so scary.
Hey, what are you doing for New Year's?
You're coming home, right?
No. I have a lot of matches coming up,
so I need to focus on practicing.
Matches?
Your last match of the year is the rank-deciding one against Mr. Yasui on the 24th, right?
Oh, that's right.
Speaking of Mr. Yasui, it seems he's finally getting divorced.
He's usually a meek, modest guy. But when he loses, he drinks, gets crazy, and gambles.
I'm surprised his wife put up with it for this long.
I feel sorry for his daughter the most.
She must've been scared.
I mean, living under the same roof with a father who breaks bad every time he loses.
Ah, I hate this.
But I hear the daughter had one wish.
She said, I want to be with Papa until Christmas.
I can't stand it.
This...
It brings tears to your eyes. Don't you think?
The way she speaks, her words sticking to me like glue...
Hey, Rei, are you listening?
But more than anything...
Hey.
Sheesh.
Your scarf will blow away.
You should wrap it properly.
Children have it rough.
After all, they can't choose their parents.
Oh. But come to think of it,
it was different for you.
You chose your own parents.
You chose somebody else's father.
Hey, Dad, can we open them now?
Oh, sure.
Hey, what is this giant teddy bear?!
Pow Pow Pow
Take that! Take that!
Jeez, Dad! I'm in middle school now!
A Game Bomb!
For a child of this family...
What do you think, Rei?
Should I have gotten you a toy, too?
Oh, no. Thank you.
I'm happy with these.
It was unmistakable.
How my foster brother and sister were very hurt then...
Hey, it's sad, don't you think?
A papa who comes home after winning, or a papa who comes home after losing.
Well then...
which would be more fitting as a final Christmas memory?
Aside from P.E. and music, not bad, I guess.
Your grades for math and physics are awesome.
Report Card
That being said, here.
You need to be in Sendagaya by 9:30, right? You should hurry.
Morning
Anyway, you're a busy guy, aren't you?
You even have matches up until Closing Ceremonies.
You barely met the required attendance days this time,
but you may be in trouble if your matches increase third term. So be careful.
Ehhh?!
Are you telling me to lose? But my living is on the line.
1-B Christmas Party
By the way, after the Closing Ceremony today, the kids in the class
are having a Christmas party, apparently. Did you know about it?
No, of course I didn't know about it.
Please don't tell me.
Well, I guess there's only one thing to do.
After your match is over, why don't you come back here?
Dammit, they didn't invite me either. Why?!
Just us crummy guys, eating cake while playing shogi...
Answer: You're a teacher.
No one.
I turn around and he's gone!
EEEk!
Wait a second! This just makes me a mean old teacher!
Listen until I'm done talking! Please, Kiriyama?!
When did it start?
When did Christmas become painful for me?
A certain thought crossed my mind.
It's like a report card.
From that year.
In that year, how much love did I receive from friends, family and my parents?
How did they express that love for me?
Yasui 6th-Dan...
The doors are closing. Please be careful.
The daughter said, I want to be with Papa until Christmas.
Until Christmas...
A papa who comes home after winning,
or a papa who comes home after losing.
Which would be more fitting as a final Christmas memory?
Well, Rei?

Shogi Hall
It's time.
It's time.
It's time.
Let's have a good game.
Let's have a good game.
Let's have a good game.
I lost.
Something Given (Part 2)
I get it.
You want to say I gave up in the middle of the game, don't you?
The match with Mr. Yasui ended all too soon that late afternoon.
After 8-f-Pawn, I could've surprised you, taking your knight at 9-e...
Ah, yes, yes.
Could've gone that way. If I'd noticed, I would've done that.
But I didn't notice, so it can't be helped, right?
You might've seen it, but I didn't see it, so what good is it?
Mr. Yasui continued muttering, as if he was talking to himself.
I was unsettled by the faint smell of alcohol on his breath as he sighed.
The match began slowly and quietly with a Yagura Opening.
Carefully... Carefully...
From the way he played, I could almost hear him telling that to himself.
Don't make a mistake. Don't make a mistake.
Shogi Hall
However...
After a short pause, he noticed it, too.
But afterwards, if he attacked the king from 8-f-Pawn, who knows?
If he then pulled his knight back and held out, which side would victory tilt towards?
But then I could see Mr. Yasui's silhouette lose strength and weaken.
Why?
It's not like...
It's not like the possibilities have all disappeared.
I hear the daughter had one wish.
Wait a second! Why?
Why?!
That easily?
You can't let go!
Your focus, your awareness...
I want to be with Papa...
Don't give up such precious things so easily!
Please...
I'm begging you!
Don't let go!
Shogi Hall
I lost.
I think that's enough for a post-match review.
I've had enough for today.
Mr. Yasui! Mr. Yasui!
He's gone...
Which way did he go?
There he is!
Where's he going? The station isn't that way.
Mr. Yasui!
Um... Here.
That ain't mine.
Never seen it.
Mr. Yasui!
All right! Shut up, already!
And this was our last Christmas...
Is everything my fault?
Then what should I have done?
Go to hell!
It's your own fault for being weak!
You lost because you were weak!
Practice! I can tell when you don't!
If you say I know, but I can't, then just quit!
Don't come!
For me, everything's on the line!
Because I don't have anything else!
Nothing but shogi!
Don't drink booze to escape!
I have no use for weak players!
If you're going to run away...
If you can run away...
I said I had no reason to fight,
but the truth is,
I know that a beast lives within me.
It's a rampaging beast that would bite off everything in sight to survive.
When the battle begins, no matter what,
its hand reaches out towards the path of survival.
Even if it means misery for others.
No matter what kind of world awaits...
