friend
Hey!
( !)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
All right! I'll say it!
You are my best, best friend!
(Fly!) When I joke around a bit,
(Shine!) You joke around more in response.
(La La La) Nothing is better than this!
(Why!) Even if something bad happens,
(Fine!) I immediately forget about it!
(La La La)
Always keep it going!
Being together 24 hours a day isn't a problem.
Just like twins, or a parent and child, or clone cyborgs.
Then isn't there no reason to clear your eyes?
Those are completely, completely different issues.
(Fight!) Even when I get in a fight with you,
(Down!) even when I get really down,
(Shy!) even when I feel like I want to be alone,
before I realise it, you're right there; we'll be together even in death!
I wonder why it is.
I want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
time goes 100 times faster!
It's fun, isn't it?
It's way too fun!
As expected of my best friend!
What is it?
The synchro is amazing!
Always making an uproar,
bothering the neighbours a lot.
What time is it now?
And then yo de le hi hoo!
I don't get it at all!
So re doh si la!
It's better than I imagined, the absolute best!
Even if I say this and that, we're still friends. (Hooray!)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
Cha Cha La Cha La Cha Cha!
In ancient Greece, Icarus
Made bird wings out of wax
He put them on each arm and flew off
Higher than the clouds, far away
Keeping a bit of courage with him
The land steadily grew far away
The blue sea spread beneath him
Flapping the wings on his arms
Flying toward the sun
Keeping a bit of courage with him
We all live boldly
Keeping a bit of courage with us

Narration: Nagai Ichirou
Shinonome Nano.
Paralysing drugs, Mr. Short Circuit and a trap hole.
To perfectly evade all the traps I've set for her so far...
She's much better than I had expected.
I want her!
So far I've tried not to arouse suspicion by trying to capture her at school,
but now that it's come to this...
Could that possibly be...
Wait, wait!
Wait, hold on!
Thanks for the food!
Go get your dad.
Why?
Onee-chan, where's the remote?
It was under the kettle yesterday.
It wasn't him.
Hey, who are you?!
What are you doing?
A robber?!
Crap!
What, a girl?
Oh, it's Nano-chan.
T-Thank you.
That seems heavy.
Not at all.
Thank you very much.
Are you sure that you can carry them by yourself?
Mio-chan, Mio-chan!
Big news!
I'm writing a report, so tell me later.
It's not the time for that!
I saw it!
What did you see?
Sasahara-senpai and Nano-chan were walking together!
Huh?
Well, I was expecting a bigger reaction.
And?
So, yeah...
They seemed to be having a casual conversation.
I see.
That's not very out of the ordinary, is it?
Eh?
They're human.
Of course they'll talk.
Well?
Is that it?
Yeah, that's it.
I need to finish this report by next period,
so I need to concentrate.
Right, sorry.
That was lame...
And?
Huh?
So what happened?
What do you mean?
I'm asking what they were casually talking about.
Hello?
Yukko-san?
Well, um...
Sasahara-senpai was saying how her books looked heavy.
And?
That's it.
Yukko, are you just stupid?
I've always thought you were stupid,
but to think you were this stupid...
Saying there's big news...
Your idiocy itself is amazing, don't you think?
An amazing idiot?
Just kidding.
Well, Nano-chan and Sasahara-senpai were kissing, too.
Come on, now...
After having a greeting kiss,
they went to go buy bread together.
And after they talked a bit about the bread they bought,
Sasahara-senpai...
Sasahara-senpai?!
Take off his clothes!
Then, using Sasahara-senpai's statement of delicious! as an opportunity...
The two of them...
The two of them!
In the courtyard!
I totally forgot!
I need to do that report, too!
Oh, no!
We have to think of our own topic, too!
In the courtyard... in the courtyard... in the courtyard!
Oh, you bought some yakisoba bread.
Well, I like it!
You always get yakisoba bread.
I suppose that makes you the Yakisoba Princess?
Well, what did you get, then, Koujirou?
Me?
I bought a red bean bun.
So that makes Koujirou...
Hm?
What is it?
It's nothing!
I suppose that makes Koujirou...
Delicious!
That makes Koujirou...
What is it?
It's nothing!
I suppose that makes Koujirou...
I suppose that makes Koujirou a fair-skinned beauty!
Let's eat in the courtyard.
I'm up for that!
And then the teacher ate a wild whale.
Are you sure?
It's true!
If that's true, it would have to be outside the 200-mile international boundary.
That's not a problem!
That teacher's an Eskimo.
Nano...
You have yakisoba bread on your face.
The gentle time together...
Rendezvous!
I can't progress! I can't progress!
I can't work on a report in a situation like this!
I can't finish like this!
Yukko!
I just had a good idea!
Tell me what they did in the courtyard!
Just shut up already!
Well... um...
Addis!
Ababa!
Since it's come to this...
I need to go to the courtyard myself!
I need to enter that indecent Garden of Eden!
Thank you.
It was nothing.
Farewell.
Huh?
What's wrong, Naganohara-san?
Nano-chan...
Yes?
I heard you ate yakisoba bread in the courtyard with Sasahara-senpai...
Sasahara-senpai?
Oh, the person just now?
All he did was help me carry my books.
That's it?
Yup.
That's it.
Really?
How about the yakisoba bread?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Come on!
Just tell me whom you like, Yumi!
What should I do?
I promise I won't tell anyone!
If I do, I'll pay you one million yen!
Really?
You better.
Okay!
Takashi-kun.
Hey, listen up: Yumi likes Takashi-kun!
I see.
Head!
Thank you very much.
Here.
That damn genius.
How odd to find you at the dojo.
The tournament's soon,
so it's better to practise with the Master than at school.
Besides, Naganohara-san was here, so I'm relieved.
She actually hasn't been coming in lately.
What?
Really?
She says that practising makes her weaker.
She's a monster.
Whom do you usually practise with, then?
The Master, usually...
Oh, but lately Sasahara-san has been coming in a lot.
Sasahara?!
Why is he coming?!
What do you mean, why?
He's been coming to our dojo since middle school,
so why wouldn't he come?
I know that, but...
Why didn't you already know?
Don't you talk to him at school?
Aren't you in the same club?
We aren't!
He's been in the Acting Club from day one!
Acting Club?
Why isn't he in the Kendo Club?
How would I know?
Because if you take away kendo from Sasahara-san,
he's nothing more than a funny guy.
You say that because you've only seen Sasahara at the dojo!
What do you mean?
Listen, the Sasahara that joined the Acting Club...
It's just grape juice.
I can see that...
Okay?
But why didn't you invite him to the Kendo Club?
What a waste.
Huh?
Why do I have to invite him?
He can do whatever he wants.
I bet Sasahara-san can make it to the nationals!
How would I know?
Besides, he joined the Acting Club without even telling me.
He's just an idiot, a big idiot!
Well, then again...
If you care that much, Mihoshi...
I guess I can invite him...
This person...
Well?
When does Sasahara usually come?
He's been dropping by once every three days,
so he'll probably be there tomorrow.
Well, it doesn't really matter. I don't really care.
Hey, Nee-chan.
What?
Why don't you confess to Sasahara-san?
A middle-schooler shouldn't say such things!
I'm going to go ahead now.
Nee-chan...
You're too pure-hearted...
It's so cold.
Cold attack!
Later.
I see.
That was delicious.
Thank you for the food.
Professor.
You have to eat your onions, too.
I think I'm too young for onions.
What's that supposed to mean?
Regardless, you need to completely finish off your food.
Well, green onions are bitter, and I just don't understand.
If you don't eat everything, there'll be no snacks for you starting tomorrow.
You should look at Sakamoto-san.
He never leaves anything -
Sorry, I can't help you.
Sakamoto-san, what's wrong?
Are you okay?
No problem.
It's just a cold.
A little rest will cure -
But you haven't eaten anything.
You should try to have a little.
No, I'm fine.
Would you like some milk?
Not really...
This is a problem.
What do you think you'll be able to eat?
Really, I don't want anything right now.
But...
Sakamoto wants to eat green onions.
Are you trying to kill me?
Is there anything you want?
No.
Anyway, I'll leave some milk out for you.
If you need anything, please tell me.
I'll go buy it for you.
All right...
I seem to be sick, too, so I want some chocolate.
Please eat your green onions, Professor.
Why does Sakamoto get everything while I get nothing?!
Because Sakamoto-san has a cold.
I was coughing too!
You're full of energy.
I'm sick, so I want chocolate!
I have a cold, too, you know!
If you have a cold, you need to take some medicine!
Do you want some medicine?
I give up!
Hey, Professor!
Professor...
Go away!
You give me onions to bully me because you hate me, Nano!
You like Sakamoto more, so you don't force him to eat them.
That's not it.
Cats can't eat green onions.
I've never heard that before!
You're hopeless...
I like you more, Professor.
Really?
Yup.
Can I have some chocolate, then?
Let's see... Only if you finish your green onions.
Why?!
You said that you liked me more!
I like Sakamoto more, then.
What? Make up your mind!
I love you both!
What's that supposed to mean?!
Sakamoto, what's the meaning of this?!
What floor?
Oh, the seventh floor, if you would be so kind.
Thanks.
Now that I think about it, I haven't been shy this year.
Um...
Naganohara-san, your dream for the future...
Y-Yes.
You're pretty good at drawing, Naganohara-san.
No, not really.
I think it's good to go after your dreams.
Please do your best.
Let's see, Yukko wants melon juice...
What should I choose?
Well, I'm tight on money this month,
so I won't get anything special and settle for banana juice.
Sorry about that.
Sa... Sa... Sa... Sa... Sa...
Sasahara-senpai!
What's wrong?
Your expression resembles a dove that has been shot.
Oh, s-sorry!
Um, what am I supposed to do?
I should say something.
Um...
The weather's nice today...
What am I saying?!
It's completely cloudy!
How deep.
Yes.
Does this coin belong to you?
Oh, yes!
I see.
Sorry for the trouble.
Yes.
What a surprise for a thing like this to happen.
I seem to have forgotten to bring my wallet today.
I came to this vending machine in hopes of quenching my thirst,
and there, I found a coin.
I must be loved by God.
The beverage I'm about to consume...
Um...
This vending machine...
It's definitely a prankster!
Y-Yes!
Still, for this vending machine to play me like this...
It's a rare sight for a device to make such a play in this age.
I like you!
You can keep the coin.
Senpai...
I have no proof,
but it feels like I've become closer to Senpai.
Mio-chan, melon juice!
Was she trying to tell me something?
Naganohara-san is so strong that people call her invincible.
Knight.
A knight...
Speaking of knights...
Why don't you confess to Sasahara-san?
Nee-chan, the bath's ready.
I wonder if Sasahara-senpai gazes at the moon, too.
You've got pretty good muscles, Sasahara-kun.
Let's practise again soon!
All right!
I'll teach you my secret move next time!
Onee!
Look, look, look, look!
Sisters.
Geez, don't just come into my room like that!
What were you thinking about?
Shut up.
Who cares what I was thinking about?
Don't be shy, don't be shy!
I'm not being shy!
Just leave me alone!
It's always when you don't have any ten yen coins...
That is the law of me, the vending machine.
Next time on Nichijou: Episode 25.
Look forward to it!
