Hey, hey! A human's transformed into a monster!
There's no way I can punish him!
It's a first time experience for Sailor Moon.
This is no time for that kind of talk!
Oh, I'm just gonna toss all the rules out the window!
In the name of the moon, I will punish you!
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward, I can say it in my dreams
My thoughts are about to short circuit, I want to see you right now
Moonlight that makes me want to cry, midnight that keeps me from calling
Because I'm so innocent, what should I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope
Guided by the light of the moon
We will meet again and again
I count the sparkle of constellations to foretell the future of my love
We were born in the same land, miracle romance
I believe in it, miracle romance
I'm Usagi Tsukino. I don't look like a super heroine, but I am!
As you know, I transform myself by using a peculiar brooch
and fight against bad guys.
I'm the sailor warrior of love and justice, Sailor Moon!
And my friends are the smart and sweet Ami Mizuno,
and a slightly quick-tempered psychic girl, Rei Hino.
Both of them are so dependable, I feel like I'll fall behind.
But anyway, I just have to do my best!
Jupiter, the Brawny Girl In Love
Awaken, oh great ruler.
With this supremely blissful energy,
return to life, my great ruler!
The energy of humans has revived me from my long sleep.
I have long awaited this day!
But at times,
my consciousness is still drawn into the depths of slumber.
Find the legendary Silver Crystal!
The legendary Silver Crystal is necessary
for me to completely revive!
But we know nothing of its whereabouts.
When the Seven Monsters
have been revived along with the rainbow crystals,
the legendary Silver Crystal will shine!
Oh, no, I'm late! I'm late!
Hey, Usagi! You forgot something!
Oh, thanks! Can you bring it with you?!
Oh, ouch!
Ouch! Oh, ouch!
Ouch!
Sorry!
You broke my leg! Ouch!
Yo! What're you gonna do about this, Missy?
Stop it!
What?! Stop it!
What?! I saw everything!
I saw everything!
She just bumped into him, and you're getting on her case?
Talk about cheap.
What did you say?!
Hey, you might be a cutie,
but you're not getting away with that!
You bitch!
Amazing.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes! Are you all right?
Oh, yes!
Be careful.
A rose-shaped pierced earring. That's so nice.
When the Seven Monsters
have been revived along with the rainbow crystals,
the legendary Silver Crystal will shine!
I seem to recall that a long time ago,
our allies, the great Seven Monsters,
were sealed away by our old enemies.
Oh, our strongest warriors of legend, the Seven Monsters!
Damn our hateful old enemies!
Into the seven shards of the legendary Silver Crystal,
they sealed away the Seven Monsters,
and dropped them onto the Earth.
And those seven shards are called the rainbow crystals.
Rainbow crystals...
What of the Seven Monsters?
They were reborn as human beings,
and have lost their memory as monsters.
I see.
So, if we recover the rainbow crystals from those human beings,
we can get a hold of the legendary Silver Crystal, correct?
Yes. And the strongest warriors, the Seven Monsters will also be revived.
I have modified it so it will only respond to the rainbow crystals.
Thank you.
Zoi!
One of the rainbow crystals is in this man's body.
Hurry! Let's go! The seats will be taken!
It's lunch time, lunch time. My tummy is groaning.
That's the girl with the rose-shaped pierced earrings!
Miss Usagi!
Don't show up out of nowhere!
Oh, no, that girl transferred into Class 6 today.
What?
Her name is Makoto Kino. She has enormous physical strength! What?
Her name is Makoto Kino. She has enormous physical strength!
Rumor is, she was kicked out of her previous school
because she got into a fight.
You'd better stay away from her, Miss Usagi. If you're not careful...
Huh?
Oh, Miss Usagi!
Wow! Her lunch looks so cute and yummy!
Her pouch is adorable, too!
Oh, those seasoned rice balls look so yummy!
Who's there?!
Hello!
Oh, it's you. I didn't know you went to this school.
I'm Usagi Tsukino!
Why don't you join me?
Oh, okay! Thank you for this morning.
What?!
Would you like to have some?
What?! But I don't eat too much, though...
What?
What? What?
What?
Thanks for the food! What?
Thanks for the food!
It's good!
I'm glad you like it!
I don't know why,
but everyone here's scared of me and won't talk to me.
Hey, Mako. Oh, sorry, you're okay with Mako, right?
Oh, sure.
Your mother must be a genius chef!
Oh, this? I made it myself.
What?! That's amazing! Wow! Teach me, teach me!
Oh, maybe I should get you to fix my lunch! Just kidding!
Miss Usagi is a genius when it comes to making friends.
Crown
Crown Hey, Mako, why don't you wear our school uniform?
Crown This is more my style.
Crown I see.
I see.
Oh? I wonder if Motoki's not working today?
Who is this Motoki? Oh, is he...
your older brother?
Bro...
No, no. Motoki is...
Excuse me?!
Usagi!
So, this is where you were.
What is it?
Well, Luna says that girl bothers her.
That girl? You mean Mako?
Right.
I think you're thinking too much, Luna. Right.
I think you're thinking too much, Luna.
Oh, shoot! It beat me!
Mako!
What? Mako!
What? Let me introduce you.
Let me introduce you.
This is Makoto Kino. She just transferred to Juban Junior High today.
Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you, too! Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you, too!
And this is the smart Ami and the meanie Rei.
Who are you calling a meanie?
You!
I didn't hear you. Who did you say? You!
I didn't hear you. Who did you say?
You!
What year, month, day, day of the week, hour, minute or second
was I ever mean to you?!
That's why you're mean!
You guys really get along.
What?! No way! What?! No way!
She's always picking fights with me whenever she sees me!
Who picks the fights?!
You do! Who picks the fights?!
You do! They say, the more you fight, the better friends you are.
They say, the more you fight, the better friends you are.
She's got a point there.
Oh, she's so cute!
That cat with the crescent bald spot is named Luna.
She's staying at my house.
Wow!
Wow! He did it again! It's amazing!
What? Wow! He did it again! It's amazing!
Wow! It's amazing! He got two! Wow!
That's something!
Oh, Usagi!
Oh, Yumi! Oh, Usagi!
Oh, Yumi!
Oh, Yumi! Did you see that?!
Did you see that?!
Yeah, I did! Did you see that?!
Yeah, I did!
Yeah, I did! That guy's called Joe, the Crane Game Raider.
That guy's called Joe, the Crane Game Raider.
Crane Game Raider? What the heck is that?
He's a genius crane game player!
They say that when he goes after an arcade,
it loses every last one of its stuffed animals to him.
Wow, isn't that amazing, Mako?
He looks exactly like him.
Mako? He looks exactly like him.
Mako?
My senior...
Hello, there? Mako? Mako? Earth to Mako?!
What could have gotten into her?
There we go! Oops!
I've found you!
What the?!
This will be over quickly.
Zoi!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop right there!
It's not nice to pick on people weaker than you.
Shoot!
You'll get hurt if you interfere!
What are you doing?
Not too bad.
Barbaric.
You injured my precious face!
Mako! Whoa, what's going on?! A fight?!
Shoot!
Wait! Shoot!
Wait! What's wrong?!
What's wrong?!
Are you okay?
Mako, what happened? Are you okay?
Mako, what happened?
Let go!
Just leave me alone!
Oh, but...
What's wrong with him?! We were worried for him and...
Oh, Mako?!
What's wrong?!
I felt it.
Felt what? I felt it.
Felt what? I felt a strong evil aura coming from the guy she was just fighting.
I felt a strong evil aura coming from the guy she was just fighting.
What?!
He might be part of the Dark Kingdom! What?!
He might be part of the Dark Kingdom!
No way!
Then Mako and that guy are in danger!
Wait for me!
How long are you going to keep following me?!
Well, it seems like someone's after you, so...
I'll be your bodyguard!
There's no reason for anyone to go after me!
You've won too much on those crane games, so... Bang!
Maybe the arcades hired a hit man!
No way.
Hey, teach me the trick to those crane games.
You could never do it.
What's wrong?
Hey.
I want to have a cup of coffee by myself!
What a jerk!
That's why I like him...
He looks exactly like my senior at school who broke my heart.
That's totally the face of a girl in love.
You don't need to keep me company, you know.
Now, now...
He's telling you to come inside! You did it!
What shall I do?
What are you saying after all this time?!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Oh, wait a minute! Wait!
No waiting! Go for it, Mako!
Well, uh...
Have a seat.
Okay. Have a seat.
Okay.
Don't get the wrong idea.
What?!
It's just too annoying to have someone standing outside staring at me.
Okay.
The reason I'm good at crane games
is because I have a kind of psychic power.
Psychic power?
I've had a strange power since I was a kid.
What?!
So, do you get it now? No one else can imitate what I do.
That's why I told you that you could never do it.
But you know... Isn't that called cheating?
I don't care! I should make good use of my talent.
I don't know about that.
Can I help you?
Oh, I'd like a large curry and rice...
No, that's not what I meant! A milk tea.
Help!
That man!
You're going to leave a girl behind and run?!
I don't care about that girl! She just followed me!
What did you say?! And you call yourself a man?!
I don't care! Anyway, a huge girl like her isn't my type!
Zoi!
Just as we thought, he's from the Dark Kingdom!
Oh, Mako! Are you okay?! Mako!
He said the same thing...
Mako?
Damn it! Mako?
Damn it!
Help!
You don't need to run. You're one of us.
One of you?!
I'm taking the rainbow crystal.
So, this is it.
Stop right there!
Sailor Moon!
You're a bit late, Sailor Moon.
Who are you?!
Let me introduce myself.
I am one of the Great Four of the Dark Kingdom, Zoisite.
What?!
I'll leave the rest to you, monster Geisein!
He disappeared!
He's gone!
Geisein!
He's turned into a monster!
Geisei...
I'm a huge fan of Sailor Moon! How dare you do this to her?!
That's...
Take this!
Amazing!
Geisein!
Watch out!
I can't move!
Sailor Moon!
Wait!
You're a sailor warrior!
Luna, you spoke!
Hold this transforming pen and say, Jupiter Power Makeup!
And help Sailor Moon!
Okay.
Jupiter Power Makeup!
Sailor Jupiter!
Mako is?!
My guardian, Jupiter!
Brew a storm! Call the clouds! Bring down the lightning!
Supreme Thunder!
Geisein!
Supreme Sundae?
Okay, one more time! Supreme Sundae?
Okay, one more time!
Okay, one more time! No, you can't!
No, you can't!
What?! No, you can't!
What?! That monster still has the heart of a human!
That monster still has the heart of a human!
He was originally a human being!
What?!
Then, what are we supposed to do?! What?!
Then, what are we supposed to do?!
Turn that monster back into its human self!
But, how?!
What's this?!
It's the Crescent Moon Wand! What's this?!
It's the Crescent Moon Wand!
Say, Moon Healing Escalation!
Got it!
Moon Healing Escalation!
Refresh!
You are the fourth warrior, Sailor Jupiter!
Sailor Jupiter?
Sailor Moon, we now have all four sailor warriors.
You have to become the leader and protect the princess!
Me?! The leader?!
That's right! The Crescent Moon Wand is proof that you're the leader!
Crown
Crown Take that and that and that! And that and that!
Take that and that and that! And that and that!
I hate... I hate men!
One more time!
Hi, Usagi!
Oh, Motoki!
I heard that Crane Game Joe was here yesterday!
I wish I could've seen him!
Really? Oh, let me introduce her. She's my friend, Makoto Kino.
Hello!
He's exactly like my senior at school who broke my heart.
What?!
Yesterday, you told me he looked exactly like Crane Game Joe!
No, his voice sounds exactly the same.
Oh, Mako!
What a weird girl.
In my dream, you and I were together
Protected by the stars
When we were friends, it didn't bother us
And we casually talked to each other
But there was a moment when I noticed only you
I want to become prettier right here and now
Something changes when you fall in love
I close my eyes and check to make sure
I want to convey the thrill I felt when we held each other
