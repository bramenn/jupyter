Go round, merry-go-round!
Go up, pink Ferris wheel!
This is a great place! An amusement park that entices girls!
It's a terrible crime to use our innocent, dreaming hearts!
In the name of the moon, Sailor Moon will punish you.
I'm sorry I'm not straightforward, I can say it in my dreams
My thoughts are about to short circuit, I want to see you right now
Moonlight that makes me want to cry, midnight that keeps me from calling
Because I'm so innocent, what should I do? The heart is a kaleidoscope
Guided by the light of the moon
We will meet again and again
I count the sparkle of constellations to foretell the future of my love
We were born in the same land, miracle romance
I believe in it, miracle romance
I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old. I'm in the 8th grade.
I'm clumsier than others
and a bit of a crybaby. That's about it.
One day, a strange black cat, Luna, appeared
and gave me a peculiar transforming brooch
and made me a sailor warrior.
But, she wants me to fight against bad guys.
That makes me really nervous.
Oh well, I guess everything will be okay.
Usagi vs. Rei? A Nightmare in Dreamland
Hikawa Shrine
When the three of you get together like this, it's so heartening.
But, we shouldn't get overconfident.
Our battle is still ahead of us.
Hey! A Sailor V comic book! Our battle is still ahead of us.
Hey! A Sailor V comic book!
No! I haven't finished it yet either!
Oh, come on! Cheapskate!
Rei, you have a nice encyclopedia. Oh, come on! Cheapskate!
Rei, you have a nice encyclopedia.
Rei, you have a nice encyclopedia. Let me borrow it!
In other words...
Rei, don't pull it too much! You'll end up tearing it!
Rei, don't pull it too much! You'll end up tearing it! So what I'm trying to say is...
So what I'm trying to say is...
That's enough!
Having three of you is meaningless, if you're always like this.
Be more aware of yourselves as warriors.
I'm sorry.
Easy for you to say.
So, what do you want us to do?
Like I've been saying,
you girls need to work together to find the princess!
How?
She must have a sign hanging on her saying who she is. How?
She must have a sign hanging on her saying who she is.
Oh, okay!
Come on, you two...
She doesn't?!
Unbelievable! Then there's no way we can find her.
Then let's do something else until Luna gets information on the princess.
Something else?
We'll protect everyone from the eerie enemies that threaten the peace!
You're the best, Ami!
Another Disappearance?! You're the best, Ami!
Another Disappearance?! Look at this!
Look at this!
Oh, this is Dreamland!
Dreamland?
Remember? It's a new amusement park.
They say something mysterious is going on in Dreamland.
Something mysterious?
Of the people who went to Dreamland in the last week,
fifty have gone missing.
To think you allowed a third sailor warrior to join them...
Jadeite!
Yes, my lady!
You do not have many opportunities left to redeem yourself.
I'm already working on a plan to steal a large amount of energy.
Really?
I will also kill those three sailor warriors, without fail!
Do not forget what you have just said!
Remember, I can always replace you!
I understand.
Dreamland Management Office Information Desk Park Announcement Office
Dreamland Management Office Information Desk Park Announcement Office So, I do not think these incidents have anything to do with Dreamland.
But the fact is, fifty of your customers have gone missing!
The number of people who came in and who came out of here
has been the same everyday.
It is not as if those people disappeared here.
Now, any more of this will be considered obstructing our business.
Please leave!
How violent!
Stupid humans...
If the number matches,
did those people disappear on their way home from Dreamland?
But it's strange that only people who come here disappear.
That's true.
Oh, where did Usagi go?
I'm sure she's goofing off somewhere again.
No way.
Yay! No way.
Yay!
Yahoo! Yahoo! I'm riding a horsie!
Yeeha! Whoa! Whoa!
I can't believe you!
Just what were you thinking, Usagi?
I'm sorry, I was wrong.
Be more responsible! And you call yourself a sailor warrior?!
Don't be so bossy!
A lion?
Hello.
It...
It spoke! It...
It spoke!
Don't worry, he's a mechanical lion.
You're the Dream Princess!
I wanted to see you!
You said it's mechanical?
Yes. It's controlled by a remote control.
It's amazing!
Something's wrong!
What?
You're adorable, Mr. Bear!
Usagi!
Get off!
What are you doing?!
I sense a strange aura coming from that Dream Princess.
That can't be...
You just don't get it because you're so dense!
Hey!
Is that any way to treat your senior?!
I have a show at the candy house in an hour.
Please come and see me.
Of course!
The candy house?
That must be the candy house!
I have to go!
Come, sailor warriors.
I will suck out all of your energy until nothing is left.
Once someone gets in here, they can never get out.
I see nothing wrong.
Okay, let's split into two groups and look!
Ami will come with me. Usagi, go with Rei!
What?!
If you don't want to, that's fine!
But...
Then, we'll see you later.
We're going, too!
Don't be so bossy!
Are you suspecting the Dream Princess?
My hunch is usually right.
She doesn't look like a bad person.
You just don't understand.
Look! Even the animals are adorable!
Your name is also an animal, since it means rabbit.
What do you mean by that?
Oh, no!
No! Don't get on that animal!
Why? It's mechanical, but it's safe, you know.
I don't care, just get him off!
Okay, then.
Let's do it again later.
No! You should ride it now!
Hey!
It's not a big deal!
Oh, you're so happy-go-lucky!
Rei, you're just too suspicious! Relax!
No!
It's okay!
No!
It's okay!
I said, no!
I said, it's okay! I said, no!
I said, it's okay!
What are you doing to my boy?!
Mommy.
It seems like we're just playing.
This is the best way to patrol.
I am sorry, it is a stop signal.
Please wait for a moment.
Oh, man...
Hey!
What? You, again?!
Wait a minute! You rammed me with your rock-hard head!
That's no way to treat me, you dumpling head!
Dumpling head, is it? I can so see that!
They also look kind of like hot spring buns.
Oh, you're right! They also look kind of like hot spring buns.
Oh, you're right!
Oh, you're right! See?
That's enough, both of you! See?
That's enough, both of you!
Anyway, what's a guy doing on a toy train all by himself?!
Could it be you're actually a really big loser?!
You make me laugh! ! It's so funny, my tummy hurts!
I've got my reasons for being here!
She just had to touch a sore spot.
Hey, Mr. Panda!
Don't keep doing this stop and go!
A show will be starting at the candy house.
A show will be starting at the candy house.
Mr. Panda, stop! Stop! A show will be starting at the candy house.
A show will be starting at the candy house.
I cannot just stop and go anytime.
He's so inflexible!
Hey, hey! The guy sitting in front of us...
Doesn't he sort of look like Tuxedo Mask?
No, he does not! He looks nothing like him!
Luna!
Oh? Where's Ami?
Inside!
No fair! No fair!
Why did she get to go in by herself?!
I feel an evil aura.
Wow! These are real sweets!
Amazing! Wow! These are real sweets!
Amazing!
These candies look like gems.
They're beautiful!
We may find some kind of clue in here.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Please enjoy the show!
Okay!
It's like a dream.
I wish I could stay here like this forever.
No way! This just can't be possible!
I will take your energy while you are dreaming.
I see! That apple collects energy...
As I thought, this is the place where everyone disappeared.
What's wrong?
Something's happened inside!
What?!
Oh, no! Ami is... What?!
Oh, no! Ami is...
It's no use! It's locked!
No! Ami!
Don't cry about every little thing!
Aren't you worried about Ami?!
I didn't say that!
No, Rei, you're a cold person! I realize that now!
Don't jump to conclusions!
Both of you, transform now!
Mars Power Makeup!
Come on, Usagi, you, too! Don't waste time!
I know!
Moon Prism Power Makeup!
Fire
Soul!
Let's go!
She's being bossy again! Let's go!
She's being bossy again!
So, you have come, sailor warriors.
Today will be your last day!
I have been waiting for you.
Be careful! This is an illusion!
Here, this is a present for you.
Oh, thank you.
Stop it!
Sailor Mars!
I'm sorry! It's my fault.
You're in big trouble now.
The poison will spread through your blood and you'll turn into stone.
See?
Don't panic over something this small!
Be gone, evil spirit
Be gone, evil spirit Rin, Pyo, Tou, Sha, Kai, Jin, Retsu, Zai, Zen!
Be gone, evil spirit
Be gone, evil spirit!
Thank goodness! I'm so glad for you!
There's no time to cry!
It's time you revealed who you are!
Very well.
Please wait for a moment.
I am the monster, Moolyd.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, the pleasure is ours...
Hey!
Oops!
Hey, monster!
I can't forgive you for using the innocent hearts of dreaming maidens!
By maidens, are you referring to yourself?
Does it really matter?!
Well, anyway!
In the name of the moon, I will punish you!
Ooh, how scary.
Let's go have another dream, shall we?
Watch out! It's another illusion created by the monster.
I'll be all right this time! I won't fall for anymore stupid traps!
I don't know about that.
The sound of a horse's hooves!
It's coming this way!
Be alert!
Tuxedo Mask!
He's absolutely gorgeous!
He's so cool!
Hey, hey!
That's a trap!
Hey!
Hello?!
You're falling right into the enemies trap!
You really did fall into the trap.
I will take your energy while you are dreaming.
Oh, please wait for me!
What?
You should dream only when you're sleeping. Goodbye!
What? Where's Tuxedo Mask?
What is this?
Was Tuxedo Mask really here after all?
I will let you dream one more time.
Let's get out of here for now!
I shouldn't have come all by myself.
Ami!
Are you okay?
You came here to help me!
I hope we can, but...
Uh-oh!
Everyone, that apple is what absorbs the energy!
What?!
All three of you need to work together!
Right!
Mercury Power Makeup!
Oh?
Aim for that apple!
Okay!
Bubble
Spray!
Oh? Where am I?
Be gone, evil spirit!
Moon Tiara Action!
Fire
Soul!
I cannot move.
Shoot!
We did it!
Darn you, sailor warriors.
You will pay for this!
Listen!
You were able to win because all of you worked together!
Don't forget about what happened today.
Yes, I know!
Hey, isn't yours bigger than mine?
Don't be ridiculous! You picked which one you wanted!
Trade with me!
No way! Trade with me!
Dreamland No way!
Dreamland Hey, trade! Trade!
Dreamland
In my dream, you and I were together
Protected by the stars
When we were friends, it didn't bother us
And we casually talked to each other
But there was a moment when I noticed only you
I want to become prettier right here and now
Something changes when you fall in love
I close my eyes and check to make sure
I want to convey the thrill I felt when we held each other
