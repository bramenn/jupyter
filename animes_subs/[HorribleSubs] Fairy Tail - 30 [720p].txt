Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
Oh, no! The Council is angry!
Well of course they'd be angry after we keep running amuck all the time.
Thank you very much...
The master has been called before the Council!
What'll we do?
Thank you very much!
And wait... Who are you?
It'll be all right! I'll yell it out countless times.
I believe your every tomorrow will be shining.
The intersection of all people
Never giving up. And that's why we're not gonna lose!
When it seems like you'll be blown away by the headwinds,
grasp this hand, try to take a chance.
Because you're not alone anymore, got it?
Go forward, more and more!
Don't give up on your awesome dream!
That's right, don't cry!
Move on, my way!
Now, with the light shining down upon you.
Don't even think about something like giving up!
Even if you trade being hurt again for strength.
Your eyes, always looking straight ahead,
can surely see the light!
Um... Makarov, sir?
Yes?
We are in the middle of the trial... I presume you are not sleeping, correct?
But of course not!
Phantom Lord has been disbanded.
And Jose has been stripped of his place among the 10 Wizard Saints.
So far, that's as I expected.
But to judge Fairy Tail as completely innocent?
I wouldn't have expected that.
You should be grateful, Macky.
I argued on your behalf, you know.
I'm in your debt, Yaji.
When the guild's fixed up, come over for a visit.
I'll treat you to some ramen.
I'd like a Fairy Ramen with 12 pork slices.
12 slices is a bit much, you think?
Remember you violated the ban on inter-guild conflict in Paragraph 4!
Oh, fine!
I'll put in 20 or 30 slices if you want!
12 pork slices.
Macky... Don't push yourself.
We're no longer young.
You still haven't forgotten, yes?
About what?
About Rob.
Rob... Rob, huh?
Me and you and Poluchka...
And Rob too...
We were all so young.
We overdid it, but every day sure was a fun.
Then Rob quit Fairy Tail... Erza tells me stories once in a while.
Lately many people are of the opinion that Fairy Tail has gone too far too often.
Indeed, Michello and Org have requested you be disbanded.
At this rate you will be facing serious punishment, Macky.
Dead, you're no good to anybody.
Like Rob...
Macky, hurry up and retire. For the sake of your health.
Next Generation!
Everyone! You can all take jobs again starting today!
It's just a temporary counter, but do all the jobs you can!
What's with them?
Usually they're just hanging around not taking any jobs.
Oh, yeah, I haven't seen Loke around...
I see you've finally fallen for Loke's magic touch then, Lucy...
That's not it!
I just heard that he found my keys, so I wanted to thank him.
Sure. I'll tell him if I see him around.
By the way, weren't your Spirits angry?
About you dropping your keys?
Oh, it wasn't anything enough for them to get that mad about...
I told you not to drop it, girl!
Just remembering makes my butt sting...
Oh, my...
Shall I chill it for you?
I don't need innuendo-style sexual harassment.
Lucy, let me see your bright red butt!
And no overt sexual harassment either!
I wonder what she'll look like if I make it sting even more!
And you're just the devil!
Try saying that again!
Erza?
This time I'll tell you straight out.
We don't need weaklings in this guild!
You guys are pitiful.
Getting humiliated by Phantom like that...
And wait, I don't even know your names.
And you there, the main culprit, the debutant Celestial Spirit user... It was your fault.
Laxus!
It's all over now.
No one has been talking about who to blame for it.
You have no right to say anything when you didn't even help us fight!
That's what the master says.
Well, yeah! It had nothing to do with me!
Although if I had been there, you wouldn't have had all that trouble.
Why, you...
Hold it right there!
Natsu!
Laxus! Fight me!
You heartless bastard!
What kind of fight would it be when you can't even catch me?
When I inherit the guild, I'll get rid of all the weaklings.
As well as anyone who stands against me!
I'll make the ultimate guild!
The strongest guild in history that no one can look down upon!
Inherit? What nonsense is he talking about?
It's not nonsense.
Laxus is the master's grandson, you see.
So when Master retires, the chances that Laxus becomes the next master are quite high.
B-But...
I'd be against someone becoming the master who thinks that way about his allies.
The rumor is that's why he hasn't been able to retire.
Is that it?
That jerk!
Enough. You'll just tire yourself out dealing with him.
Anyway, what do you think? Want to go do a job?
Together with Gray and Lucy, of course.
What?
Gray, your clothes...
I have a sense that we've been together ever since the Eisenwald incident.
Now you get a sense like that?
We all thought it was pretty obvious.
She never stopped to think about it herself?
That's Erza for you.
Let's form a team now.
With the four of us. Or five, if you count Happy.
But do you really want someone like me?
Not someone like you...
Someone that is you, Lucy!
Aye!
Without you, things just wouldn't fit right, you know?
Looks like Fairy Tail's strongest team is official now.
Good for them.
And wait, Lucy's the strongest?
If I was up against Aquarius, I couldn't win either.
And her straight-man act is amazing!
The strongest in a lot of different ways.
W-With him?
Got a problem?
No, never happier!
Let's hurry and do a job.
We'll take down the Magic Sect operating in the shadows of the castle town of Lupinus!
Let's go!
Retire, huh?
The guild's being remade.
So then the master should also pass to the next generation.
Laxus...
His attitude has some big problems.
Mystogan...
He's basically a poster-boy for lack of communication.
And then there's Erza, but she's still too young...
Master? You're up there?
It looks like they've gone and done it again.
It seems like Erza and her team destroyed half a city while on a job.
The Council has requested you submit a written explanation immediately!
Huh? Master, what's the matter?
Retire? No frickin' way!
Oh? You don't seem so well, Lucy.
What's the matter?
The job at Lupinus from earlier.
Sheesh... Natsu spewed fire everywhere...
Gray froze everything...
And Erza...
Erza especially!
Hey, Lucy... You okay?
Anyway, with all the destruction, most of our reward goes to pay reparations!
At this rate, I won't be able to pay this month's rent!
Then why don't I recommend a perfect job for you?
It's right up your alley, Lucy, and there's no need to worry about destroying anything!
And so...
Onibas? The city from the lullaby incident.
Natsu, we're here.
It's no use...
So it's a request for us to use our magic to attract lots of people to see a play, right?
Exactly.
Sounds fun, right?
Natsu can shoot fire, and you two can put on a show with your Creation Magic and her Requipping!
Then I'll move everyone's hearts with Lyra's singing.
It'll be a wonderful performance, don't you think?
If I ever finish my novel, I hope it gets turned into a play.
Right! This is a great opportunity to study staging a play!
It's a pretty nice place.
Let's go!
Um...
You are the people from Fairy Tail, yes?
Yes!
Thank you very much for accepting my request!
Sure! Just leave the stage work to us!
About that...
We have a bit of a problem...
What? The actors have all run out on you?
That is correct. Thank you very much.
Thanks for what?
My plays have been more and more unpopular.
So now, the actors are ashamed to be in my productions!
Even my wife tired of me chasing my dream and left me!
This was my last chance!
Thank you so very much!
You don't get this thanking thing, do you?
Anyway, the play is canceled!
Thank you very much!
I figured it was something, but this?
If you need actors, then you've got some right here!
S-She's shining!
She's doing vocal exercises!
Well, that does sound kind of fun.
Really?
Aye!
We won't let your dream end here!
You're so...
Well, might as well let them give it a shot.
Damn amateurs.
Now you don't thank us?
We have one week until opening.
I am Fredrick!
And I have come to save the Princess!
Wow, Erza! You've got quite the stage presence!
She's really gotten into the role.
I won't lose to her!
Yeah.
Aye, sir!
After that, when we weren't practicing, we were handing out fliers and constructing the set...
Remembering all the lines was pretty tough.
But in the end, we were all in the spirit of it and having more fun than ever.
Some fans are here to see you, thank you very much.
Fans?
Yo!
I don't even know where to start!
It's almost time for the debut performance. Break a leg!
It's been so long since I've seen a play!
I appreciate the invitation, Macky.
Long time no see! How've you been?
I came to heckle you.
Meat!
And wait, what are you doing here, fake Salamander!
It's been a while, Micheal.
It's Bora!
After my heart was hit with your fiery fist, I've given up forcibly scouting for pin-up girls!
Was that what happened again?
What did you think it was?
Uh, well...
Lucy was thinking of naughty things!
Madame, I'll be rooting for you!
Sorry about having you come all this way.
So hard!
Aren't you from Galuna Island?
I'm Lulu!
Thanks again for back then.
And aren't you from Phantom?
I was also captivated by his power!
And that's that.
Have some food.
Meat!
That's raw, you know.
Well, I didn't make it for you!
Tsundere...
Hey, thanks...
Not for you!
It's for that red dog.
It's blue. And a cat.
How long until you destroy the moon, huh?
Do I even need to say anything?
Good luck!
I'm beat, and the performance hasn't even started...
Then!
It's finally opening day!
I've never had such a large audience!
Thank you very much!
And I never sang in front of so many people!
All that's left is to put on a good show!
Far, far away...
A story of long ago...
A Prince of the West Kingdom fell in love with a Princess of a rival Kingdom...
What a beautiful voice!
Wonderful!
Madame!
That Prince is awesome!
To save the Princess, the Prince of the West Kingdom went to the mountain of death...
Whoa...
Why is she so nervous?
I guess she's one that freezes for the real deal.
Aye!
M-My na... is... Fred... Prin... to save...
What?
But so lovely!
Meat's gone bad!
She's frozen stiff.
No, I can feel the earnest nervousness in her performance!
One of those Lamaze method actors, I guess.
Uh, no.
She skipped forward!
It's too early for that line!
She's so nervous, she's barely breathing.
With ten swords of...
More, Madame!
You're risking your life just watching this play.
How fun!
Erza's broken down!
What are we going to do?
Anyway, we need to try whatever we can to cover for her!
Is it my entrance yet?
Shut up!
Oh, please save me, Prince Frederick!
I've been captured by Seinhart!
Seinhart?
Who's that?
My name is Julius!
If you want the Princess back, then fight me!
Who are you?
What happened to Seinhart?
I don't understand!
Everyone is really talented!
F-F-Fight! Fight! Fight!
Crap! Erza's reached her limit!
Leave it to me!
Gate of the Clock, I open thee!
Horologium!
F-Fight, fight! she says.
What are you doing, Lucy?
Because if Frederick is defeated here, then the story can't progress!
Great Clock, how excellent of you to come!
Please allow Prince Frederick to rest a little while!
I've caught my breath!
I'm back!
Take this! Sword of ice!
Why, y-you...
I-I have t-ten swords!
Save me!
Weak!
Don't run!
What realism!
Is this what they call the marriage blues?
How long until he appears?
Thank you very much, Prince Frederick!
P-Princess Yanderica, let us make many children!
About 30 or so!
Isn't that moving a bit fast?
And wait! I don't get it!
But Prince Frederick is dreamy!
This play is surreal...
Pretty interesting.
Everyone is shining!
Your brief respite is now over, thusly!
Julius is back!
What's with the thusly?
This is the end for you!
Come, my dragon!
It's finally my cue!
Yes, yes!
I will destroy everything! I am a dragon!
There he is!
The red dog!
In that case, we must join forces!
Y-Yeah... That's quite reassuring.
You're the one that called it!
What kind of a twist is that?
I'll keep it busy!
You two make a run for it!
Princess, what the hell are you doing?
Thanks a bunch!
Yeah!
They're running away?
Ooh, they're eloping!
Gray's one smooth operator.
Oh, youth.
H-Heavy...
Gray, help!
Ice, ice!
All right! Ice Make...
Oh, my...
Thank you very much!
Princess, are you okay?
Why do you hog the spotlight when you suck so bad?
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Stop it, Natsu!
Princess Yanderica's awesome body is the best!
The best!
Now, now...
What are you doing showing up on your own?
I told you, remember?
I will always protect you and your nice body, Lucy!
Why did he even show up?
In this case... I-I must...
It's all gone to heck!
And... I have a really bad feeling about this...
I knew it!
Why'd it turn out like this?
Macky, hurry up and retire.
Oh, my...
It's the curse of the moon!
Bravo!
Prince Frederick!
Awesome! It was great!
Wonderful!
Then, one week later.
I can't believe it was such a huge hit.
Not bad for a bunch of stand-ins.
Come on, give us our reward already.
Three performances a day is way too much!
Lazy bums! Hurry up and get ready!
He's totally changed...
I want... I want to go home now!
Hey, hey Natsu! I think LLLoke totally lllikes LLLucy!
Well, if you role your tongue like that...
But seriously, Loke is always avoiding her.
He's just playing hard to get.
Um, sure, whatever you say.
I don't really get it.
Next time: The Star that Cannot Return to the Heavens!
Anyway, LLLoke totallly lllikes LLLucy!
You just feel like talking that way, don't you?
