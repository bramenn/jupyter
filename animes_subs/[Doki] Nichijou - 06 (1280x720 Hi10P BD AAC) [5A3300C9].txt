TL note: Shiritori is a Japanese word game in which the players are required to say a word which begins with the final kana of the previous word.
H!
O?!
I do fall in love!
I just realised it for the first time
That I had fallen in love
Twenty-four hours a day thinking of you, you and nothing more than you!
It's something I wasn't consciously aware of
Somehow ( somehow) I'm feeling different from the usual
With you ( the two of us) and our dull chatter
Don't tell me ( mutual love?) Nope, it's a one-sided crush
This is bad! Our gazes met!
What, what? Why is my heart pounding like this?
Did a short circuit just make a mess out of my mind?
This is my first time... feeling like this...
I wonder if I have a fever
Suddenly and precipitately, love has arrived.
Instantly igniting my face into a bright red
T-That's stupid?! My hands are shaking
Is this really what they call love?
I-I did it! A conversation filled with stutters
This awkward silence... *mumble mumble*
Your... ( Your...) I want to know your feelings.
O-One-sided love
First love! The usual way to school
The shining light. I do fall in love!
I feel I could fly towards the sky
O-One-sided love
10
H H!
Woke up in the morning, brushed my teeth
In the blink of an eye, it's 10pm
Today, we laughed a whole lot
We had a great time
At times, with my friends, acting like fools, being noisy
Fluttering, our eyes met.
It's a coincidence, right?
I wouldn't call this my first love
It's not my character.
Say, will we be able to meet again tomorrow?
As my eyelids close
I see you sparkling all over the place
Today was fun, too, wasn't it?
I'm in love
So happy, so happy
It is my pleasure to meet you, my new-found love.
Surely, we'll meet again tomorrow
Have a good night
We'll meet immediately in our dreams
So have a good night

Sorry for the wait.
I can only make this.
Here.
Wow, awesome!
It's twice-cooked pork.
I'm really hungry, so this is perfect.
I put something in for a hidden taste.
I wonder if you can tell.
Having a hidden taste makes it sound like the real thing.
I'm digging in!
It only has the miso flavour, or rather,
the hidden taste is not so hidden, or rather...
No, instead, the more you chew it,
the hidden taste gets worse, or rather...
I'm really against this hidden taste!
This is actually pretty good...
Mio-chan, Mio-chan!
TL note: Kappa, literally meaning river-child, is a water sprite found in Japanese folklore.
What the hell is this?
Kappa?
Why a kappa all of the sudden?
Moreover, what does she mean by is cool, isn't it?...
But...
Next time, I might want to draw something in fantasy that's interesting and strong.
Something like a Daidarabotchi and a kappa.
TL note: Daidarabotchi is a gigantic demon in Japanese mythology.
Kappa... Heh, I guess he will be the uke.
TL note: In yaoi, uke refers to the more feminine partner.
Kappa, kappa, huh?
Kappa...
Kappapaa... pa... pa...
Parasite.
With this, maybe we can just play picture shiritori.
Yukko.
Thanks.
Parashite?
TL note: In Japanese, parasite is read as parasaito, but Yukko read it as parashite.
This is what a parashite's meant to be like?
Having this arrow means...
I see. She's inviting me to a game of picture shiritori.
I'll accept it.
Hmm... Parashite...
Te... Te... Okay.
So big!
Moreover, a tengu...
She read parasite's to as te.
Oh, well.
A tengu, huh?
Tengu... gu... gu... gu...
N-No way!
Tengo!
What the hell is a tengo?!
What's a tengo?!
No! Wait a minute!
There's no way a high school student would make such a childish mistake.
I mean, she already drew a picture of a tengu and still wrote down what it was.
I don't get it.
I don't really understand, but...
I guess I'll go with go here.
Here.
What's with this Goku drawn out of boredom?
TL note: Goku is a character from a classical Chinese novel Journey To The West.
Huh... Wait... Goku?
I'm pretty sure I drew a tengu just now...
Well, I can understand how she could mistake gu for go.
I'll get juice from her later for this.
Now, it's u... u... u... Okay!
A sea urchin?
No, a rabbit.
TL note: Sea urchin is uni, and rabbit is usagi, or usa for short, in Japanese.
It's a cow?!
TL note: Cow is ushi in Japanese.
This cow is beyond terrible...
Here.
Tongue! She came at me with the tongue!
TL note: In Japanese, tongue is shita.
Then, it's ta.
Ta... ta...
Taxi... Ta...
W-Why are you doing this?!
If you write it like this, it isn't a taxi.
It's a taxy!
I'm just going to write down whatever works.
Oh, seafood has started to come up!
She's really up for it.
Okay, okay, okay.
Oh, no!
I'll lose like this!
TL note: There is no word in Japanese beginning with the sound n, so you lose if you use a word ending with the kana n in a game of shiritori.
No, this... I just have to do this...
Here.
Ah, there's nothing to do.
There's nothing to do, Sekiguchi.
Okay, Sekiguchi, let's have an Isse no se match!
TL note: Isse no se is a Japanese numbers game played using both hands.
I'll start!
Isse no two!
Sekiguchi...
There's nothing to do, anyway. Can't you play with me sometimes?
President.
Sekiguchi...
I forgot my homework and was made to stand in the hallway, Mogami river. By Yukko.
I can't believe I have to stand in the hallway just because I forgot my homework today...
How should I spend this time, Mogami river. By Yukko.
Wai -
E-Everyone! It's a deer... It's a deer...
W-Why is the principal is trying to catch the deer...?
W-Wai - Principal... D-Deer...
Principal!
W-Wait, everyone... The principal's... dying...
That's a... shika senbei?!
TL note: Shika senbei are rice crackers specially made to feed deer.
W-Wai - Everyone, the principal is d-dyin -
He got up.
He climbed up!
He jumped!
And falls down just like that!
He climbed up again!
He climbed down!
H-He's in a deadlock!
Principal!
Principal...
Wai - Everyone... Death... Principal... Death...
Uh... Wai - Um... Uh...
Wai - Everyone, listen!
Uh... Um... P-Prin...
Um... Prin...
Nothing new to report from the hallway!
Those were the true words that came from the bottom of her heart.
They were by no means to cover up for the principal,
nor because explaining it would be too troublesome.
Nothing like that.
Maybe she just wanted to show respect to the heroes who had just performed a fight to the death.
It's too early to gather the early-summer rain, Mogami river.
No idea what it means.
Okay, then. Mio-chan will be the referee.
You don't need a referee for ten yen soccer.
You don't understand, do you?
It's all about the feeling, the feeling.
Now, kick off!
I guess it can't be helped.
Come at me from any angle!
Okay...
First comes rock, next comes paper. Rockscispaper doesn't count,
rock, paper, scissors!
Chomp.
I love you.
What should I do?
I caught a cockroach...
C-Carefully...
Anyway, I'll have to do it carefully...
I have to make sure this disgusting root of evil doesn't spread in the house again.
A plan... I have to go with the most perfect plan...
Ah, pesticide spray!
No, I can't.
It's not a one-hit-kill, so there's a chance that it will just run away.
Most of all...
I don't want to see it squirm!
Ah, that's right!
What about detergent?
I'll cover the tea table with detergent to seal its movement, and then pinpoint it directly!
I-It will fly!
With nowhere to run, it'll definitely fly!
When it flies, it's over.
It'll blindly aim somewhere and hit people!
If it were to hit my body... or hit my face...!
No, wait...
I-If this was to get inside... get inside my mouth...
It's a one-shot rock and roll!
This is the worst kind of uneasiness.
I don't have any other choice.
The choice of lifting this bowl up might kill me!
Death or die!
There's...
There's no choice but to do that...
What are you doing?
S-Sakamoto-san!
Please save me!
I-Inside this, there is a r-roach... a roach.
What?
Could it be a cockroach?
I guess it can't be helped.
All right.
Leave it to me.
That'll save me.
Hey.
Yes?
What are you doing?
I'll get it, so lift the bowl.
Yes?
No, I'm saying lift the bowl.
Otherwise, I can't get it.
Hey!
W-What are you saying?!
How could I lift the seal on the root of evil?!
This is Pandora's box!
The moment I lift it up, it's death or die!
No, no, no.
How am I supposed to get it without lifting up the bowl?!
Lift it up yourself!
As if I can!
W-What should I do?
Sakamoto-san has gone somewhere...
Nano!
What's today's snack?
Ah, good timing!
The professor is not bothered by bugs either, so surely she can...
Professor, i-it'd be nice if you could get rid of t-this cockroach inside this bowl!
Sure.
R-Rock and roll!
Sorry, then I shall leave it to you.
It's okay.
I'll do it in one shot!
Men!
TL note: Men is what you say after successfully hitting your opponent's head in kendo.
Oh, I hit the wrong one.
I-I'm... I'm seriously worried here, but this person is... this person is...
Seriously, I hate you, professor!
You're going to cry?
It's just a joke!
Geez, there's no way I would hate you.
Professor, I love you.
Nano!
Geez, professor.
Nano!
Now, it's time to rock and roll!
Hey, it's hot, so can I get out?
Huh?
We just got in.
But it's become hot...
Then let's get out after a count to ten.
Twenty log root ten!
Huh?
You said we can get out once we count to ten.
Uh... Um...
You have to say One, two...
What's with everyone?
Just because they have cram school, they all leave.
Sekiguchi, you're bored as well, right?
Huh?
Come to think of it, didn't you go to cram school, too?
You've got to be kidding!
Delicious!
Yukko, how's the curry?
Yeah, it's almost done.
I'm quite hungry.
Yeah, me, too!
Mai-chan, how are things over there?
I foresee a big one.
This will be a feast.
All right! It seems like it's ready.
Thanks for waiting.
The extremely delicious super-curry is complete.
I think it will take a little longer over here.
We should have started these before the curry.
Well, they say,
Even if a baby is crying from hunger, don't remove the lid.
Ah, we should have brought mayonnaise.
You really need mayonnaise for curry.
M-Mayo -
Yukko, what do you like with curry?
Just kidding.
No... It's not like that...
T-This is... not what you think...
I still have - Look, I still have tokoroten!
TL note: Tokoroten are strips of gelidium jelly (agar).
T-Tokoroten... Just kidding.
What is your...
M-Mio-chan...
What is your...
What is the colour of your blood?!
Sorry, Mai-chan!
We've lost the curry and rice we were having for lunch.
Mai-chan...
There's still tokoroten, if you want...
Mai-chan!
Release.
Well, then. There's one tokoroten here.
Only one?!
I think we should take turns eating it.
However, as we are to blame, Mai-chan, you should start.
Rock, paper, scissors!
Just make sure you don't eat all of it in one bite!
That's upsetting to me... I'm not a demon, you know.
I'll dig in first.
I choked.
That's right! Let's play cards!
Let's not!
If things continue this way,
this'll end as a disappointing camping trip!
Let's play cards at the very last moment and give it a happy ending!
That's right!
Oh, what's up?
I totally forgot!
Adults drink alcohol at times like these, right?
T-That's right.
Hey, Mai-chan, don't you agree?
Actually, I brought some!
T-That can't be, Mio-chan.
That's right.
A delinquent.
There's a delinquent here!
Tada!
A-Any bottle is fine!
Mio-chan stop it! You'll die!
We still have Mai-chan's left!
This is cider.
Exit the bath, drink milk, act drunk.
I'm a peso!
I'm ten yen!
I'm wadoukaichin!
TL note: Wadoukaichin is Japan's first circulated coinage, minted in 708 CE.
No, no.
A person's value is not measured by money!
The next Nichijou is the seventh!
Look forward to it!
