My head!
My head is splitting open!
Is this a new form of attack by the dark alliance?
I told you not to get the regular size.
I award you the privilege to enjoy half.
Look here.
And so, our day alone together began.
Our one, precious day together.
Hey, why doesn't he have his dog with him?
Triangle... of Missed Encounters
Mr. Saigo doesn't come with his dog in Kagoshima.
How come? This is Mr. Saigo.
Everyone knows Mr. Saigo comes with a dog.
I don't see what all the fuss is about...
What?
Hey, there's a dog way over there! There's a dog!
Okay, I'm taking the picture.
Say cheese.
What are you doing here?!
I got separated from my group.
Where did you last see them?
At the souvenir shop.
Try calling them on your cell phone.
She's finally awake.
What a good idea!
Hello?
What is it? I'm on after-exam vacation. Why are you calling so early?
Did you get my voice mail?
Do not go and use my voice mail system without permission...
Oh, be quiet! Never mind, and just delete it.
Delete what? Your existence on this Earth?
No, that page on the internet.
I'm sure you're the one who went and made it.
What are you blithering about?
Just because you're getting fat is no reason to take it out on me.
Stop talking gibberish!
You can't talk your way out of this one!
Now listen. That page better be gone by the time I get back...
That faker finally returns my call, and she's full of nonsense.
I thought she was lonely for the sound of my voice.
Or maybe she was going to ask me how I was doing.
Internet page?
It really is amazing from here.
We're so close to it.
Resonating frequency perceived at a radius of five kilometers.
Magical beings detected near the vicinity of the crater.
It may be the red dragon!
I'm amazed how easily you come up with those delusions.
Yuta, I fear that the dragon's body has shattered through the crater.
It may have split into seven parts. We need to collect them all.
Not!
Wanna cross over to the other side?
Cross? Can we get there?
Yes, I think we can take a boat across.
To there?
Schwartz Schneesturm!
Schneeglockchen!
I'll go.
I doubt it's anything like whatever you're imagining.
But we have plenty of time, and it won't take long.
H-hey, you're Shichimiya.
Hero.
Hero, it's you! Hero!
Oh, I'm sorry! I never expected to find him in a place like this.
You took the words out of my mouth.
Are you also on a school field trip?
You too, Hero?
You are indeed the Hero with whom I once trusted my fate.
Wicked Lord Shingan. I'm sorry. I apologize for grabbing on to him.
I was so startled.
It is far too late for that.
Magical devil girl, Sophia Ring SP Saturn VII!
You are now treading upon the territory...
Wanna make war?
Are you two alone?
Sorta.
You're alone together, are you? Then I will let you go this time.
Sophia Ring has been tasked with an angel-finding mission.
I'll wander off that way. Bye!
Hey!
Um, actually...
I hate to ask, but can I borrow 500 yen?
I'm revived!
How could you come so far only to misplace your bag?
The angel may be running interference.
There are large shockwaves coming from Area Zero to the south.
Can you make it back to your hotel?
Never fear! I have memorized every route!
Don't lie.
I can tell.
You don't have a clue which way to go, do you?
I knew it. Is your cell phone also in the bag?
Yeah.
Come on.
I'll be fine. The whole world is linked together...
I can make it back!
Still.
I will never go near any girl but you.
Take this and begone to wherever you choose to go.
Don't solve it with money!
Damn.
Hey, Rikka?
I will soon locate it with the power of Wicked Lord Shingan.
Come with me.
Now.
Rikka.
Come to think of it, I found a piece of paper inside my bag.
Let's see.
THE WHISPERS OF MORI SUMMER
Wh-what is this?
I'm busy.
Fake Mori Summer, how do you dare use the name of Mori Summer?
What's that? You're the one who made that page, aren't you?
I have never seen this page before!
You made it because you are the fake!
Me? I would never make such a thing, and you know it.
Then who made it?
You're asking me?
Could it be the true one?
You walked through here?
I was tracking the angel's signature.
Do you remember taking anything out of your bag?
I got on and off the train with my friends.
Bought some candy and we split up.
Then I walked through here eating it.
So you would have had the bag when you were in the store.
A spirit tree.
It sure is big.
It must have incredible magical powers.
Agreed!
You two agree about the weirdest things.
Shichimiya, look.
There it is!
I knew it! Good for you.
Yeah! You're good, Wicked Lord Shingan!
That is to be expected with the power of Wicked Lord Shingan.
The angel!
No, that's a monkey!
A dark follower!
I'm telling you, that's a monkey!
Leave it to me.
The power of the Wicked Lord Shingan can handle this.
I can easily obliterate an ape being or two.
Don't do it. It'll bite you.
We need to drive it away.
But that could make it attack.
I'll go.
Hero.
Shichimiya, do you remember...
Split-second? Hero!
That's the plan.
Understood.
Rikka, you stand back.
What? Sure.
Split-second Formation - revised!
Yes! Hero!
Shichimiya!
Run for it!
Yuta.
Shichimiya!
You okay?
Yeah. We're rusty, but we pulled off the split-second formation - revised!
Yeah, I haven't tried that since.
I didn't think you'd actually remember.
But of course!
I have decided to remain unchanged for all eternity.
Along with the magical power I cultivated with you back then...
You're quite the weirdo yourself, Shichimiya.
I'm not weird. I won't change, that's all.
Here.
What's that? An arcade token?
I knew it.
Your memories have already been taken from you.
What?
Yuta? Yuta?
Yuta...
Can you stand?
Yeah. Thanks, Hero.
Yuta.
Oh, Rikka.
Yuta.
Huh?
Yuta, you...
Yuta, you have forgotten your contract!
Rikka? Hey, Rikka!
Wicked Lord Shingan.
This Mr. Saigo doesn't have a dog either.
I told you as much.
Mr. Saigo doesn't have his dog with him here in Kagoshima.
Oh, you!
Isn't that Takanashi?
Where did she go? I hope she didn't get lost.
She isn't answering her phone.
I'm sorry. This is 100 my fault.
I butted in on your private time.
No, I'm to blame.
I was so wrapped up in the bag hunt,
I didn't stop to consider her feelings.
So I want you to head back.
Prefectural Citizens Exchange Centre
I can't do that.
It's okay, really. Go.
This is your school field trip.
Look, there's a bus stop right over there.
You can find your way back if you get to a station.
But I...
Don't worry about it. Bye!
Oof.
You need to lose some weight.
Coming!
Hello, Togashi residence.
It's Shichimiya.
Is that you, Satone?
Sorry, but I need info quick, if you have it.
Bus Stop
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Okay, thanks.
So Shichimiya and Togashi were with you?
Yeah.
How did that happen?
That means they were goofing around together and neglecting you, right?
No.
But you were all alone.
I was alone because I broke away.
What the heck is Togashi doing?
Received Mail
RECEIVED MAIL IT'S SOPHIA
Map.
What?
Got a map?
Huh? You ran into Rikka?
Togashi, what are you doing?!
Surely you know that paying attention to Shichimiya
while you're spending time alone with Rikka will upset her.
You're right. Do you know where she went?
She glanced at a map and dashed off.
I see. It's okay, I'll take care of it. Bye.
Again? Kuzuha?
Incoming Call Home
Hello?
Big Brother, what are you doing?!
Not again.
Sorry for making you come all this way.
Relax, I came alone.
No one will get in our way.
I see.
I will give you fair warning. Wicked Lord Shingan is all powerful.
Even the most supreme level of light's magical power cannot defeat him.
Quit while you still can.
Huh?
The manifestation of his physical speed in this world is equally great.
To fully observe it...
Then find out to your peril just how powerful the magical devil girl really is!
Which would be fun...
I wanted you to hear me out.
I thought maybe I gave you the wrong idea about Hero and me.
Yuta, not Hero.
Hero is what I've always called him...
Granted.
Thanks. So anyway...
What?
What's it to you?!
I felt like that once.
Once, I also felt my heart flutter when I thought about him.
And I wanted to always be with him.
What? But...
But once that happened, all sorts of things began to change.
There is no doubt.
That is definitely the signature of a magical being.
Y-yeah.
H-Hero?
What is it, Sophia?
Another inter-dimensional quake through the alternate world line?
No, it's nothing.
I could feel my powers gradually ebbing away.
There!
What's wrong?
Uh, yeah.
I started to think that maybe I wasn't a magical devil girl after all.
I felt it gradually lose its meaning for me.
And then?
Yeah. Anyway...
I decided that I would stay just the way I was, forever.
In accordance to the logic of the world and its natural laws...
I am magical devil girl, Sophia Ring SP Saturn VII!
I will forsake all else to live my life to the fullest with my powers!
I'm saying that Hero's partner is you, Wicked Lord Shingan.
That will not change.
Say, Wicked Lord Shingan?
Are you going to stay the Wicked Lord Shingan forever?
Do you really think you can revive the Dark Flame Dragon?
Why did you give him that token?
I originally owned it.
But I don't think Hero even remembers that anymore.
Although it isn't my place to say it.
Well, I have an angel to track down, so I'm gone! Zoom!
Sophia.
Rikka!
Yuta?
Where's Shichimiya?
It's just that she texted me.
She said I'd find you here.
Received Mail from: Satone Shichimiya sub: From Sophia...is at the Waterfront Park.
All right, if you are a fake, confess your duplicity immediately!
My question is based on the most complex section of the Mabinogion.
If you are the true one, you can answer it.
It's here!
What is this?!
This is... death!
I'm sorry.
It is not an issue. Sophia told me everything.
I am the one who should apologize.
I am mortified that I should ever
have questioned you, Dark Flame Master,
with whom I have walked in this guise for so many months and years.
But the fact of the matter is that
we didn't end up spending much time together.
So I was thinking.
How do I say it?
Maybe it's about time, or maybe it's a little late...
The timing just never seemed right.
What is it?
Yeah. It has to be today or it's meaningless.
Here.
It's your birthday today, isn't it?
How do you know that?!
I kept that information top secret...
It was there for the whole world to see in your former email address!
Huh?
Just take it.
Is this...?
Your old one is really worn out.
I thought this would make you happy.
It's amazing.
Schwartz Shield!
Schwartz Shield!
And this.
I made it at the place we visited the other day.
It's a bonus.
This is true power of darkness.
Shall we?
Are you going to stay the Wicked Lord Shingan forever?
Do you really think you can revive the Dark Flame Dragon?
Yuta.
Do you believe the Dark Flame Dragon is alive inside of you?
What?
Will you become Ghelzonianses someday?
Don't call me that.
Well, I can't say for sure about the Dark Flame Dragon...
I always thought that the obvious answer to that was no...
Yuta.
That doesn't mean I can conjure up the flames of darkness.
You're conjuring them now.
Uh, no. This is different.
Yuta.
I love you.
