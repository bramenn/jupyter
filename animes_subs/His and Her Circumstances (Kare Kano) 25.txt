In the second half of the 20th century, Japan was suffering the greatest economic recession since the War.
What with the repeated chain reactions of bankrupcies...
Meanwhile, the masked honor student Miyazawa Yukino...
was the ultimate Queen of Vanity.
Arima Souichirou, the one who changed her...
Although how they came about was different, the two came to share a secret as...
And they decided to live for their own true happiness.
But the storms of life subjected them to an...
Go for it, Miyazawa Yukino.
Don't lose heart, Arima Souichirou.
This world exists for you!
Whatcha doing standing there daydreaming? You'll be late!
Hey, Tsuki!
I'm Miyazawa Kano,
currently in eighth grade.
I'm at a sensitive age!
My family has five members, including me.
My mother, and father, and two sisters.
Oh, and our Pero-Pero.
That makes five people and one dog.
My father's a big kid. Very naive.
Yuki calls him our big little brother,
and I have to agree.
My mother's nice.
She only talks about simple things, but she's warm and kind.
Even from our perspective, they seem to be a happy couple.
My immediate older sister is Tsukino.
I have NO clue what she's thinking.
She says zany things all the time, so I
Hey! What've you been mumbling about?
Tsuki...
Hi there.
Hi
As a whole, my family keeps up a good facade.
The oldest sister is Yukino.
Put us together and we're snow, moon, and flower,
the nice things to look at in the seasons.
I do think we sisters are all rather good looking.
Yuki is especially pretty, just like our mother.
Argh! I'm going home,
GOT IT?!
She's smart, and gets things done.
But she's a little...
That's the eldest daughter, Yukino.
Ahem
I'm in eighth grade,
but I've read lots of books and seen lots of plays.
I think I observe people rather objectively too.
I look carefree, but I really have it together.
That's me!
No matter what happens,
the family will be safe as long as I stay strong.
Maybe that's a little too pompous.
What's pompous?
O-oh, um, nothing.
Gee sis, you're home early!
What's with everyone? What are they excited about?
The lottery!
Dad said he got tickets from someone at work.
If we win, he said we could go somewhere for New Years!
Sheesh, why does our family always count the chickens before they're hatched?
Well, you could say that we're just typical middle class,
and that would be the end of it but...
Doing intense reading again?
Yeah. It's old, but it's quite touching.
Touching is good, but try to cry about it only when you're awake.
Your face is going to bloat.
What? Was I crying again...?
Don't just stick to sad stories and read something fun too, ok?
Want to borrow one of mine?
I'm a kid.
A kid... but an adult. I'm a grown-up compared to my sisters Yuki and Tsuki.
I think I have good discretion.
Praiseworthy but audacious.
But I'm really carefree.
Bye.
Don't forget about tomorrow.
Bah-bye!
Bye.
The Culture Fair's so fun.
Everyone gets so psyched up during the preparations.
But I can't believe how carefree our club is.
There's nothing for the Literature Club to get psyched up about.
I guess. They do the same thing every year.
It might be different if we did a poetry reading or something.
No way!
Nobody would listen to that.
I don't know. There might be people who'd like it...
You're late, Kano!
Oh, Tsuki.
Hello.
Sis Tsuki, don't you have to do anything?
Oh, it's fine.
My sister's sick, and I have to take her to the doctor!
So, you're going to walk home with me today.
Am I your excuse?
Well, my class is going to do a maze and a bazaar...
Who told you that?
Dad.
Figures.
What is it?
I thought there was someone watching us...
Maybe it's a stalker.
Oh, is it now?
Well, I'll have to excuse myself now.
Bye.
Bah-bye!
Take care!
It's often just your imagination at times like this.
You know, when people take the same path home and you get too self conscious.
If it's just our imagination it'll be gone before we know it.
S-s-sis...
Looks like we had the wrong misunderstanding...
How long did the silent battle go on?
It might have been only 4 or 5 minutes.
But the tension.was too much for us!
S-s-sis...
We've failed in giving our tail the slip.
Okay. I'm okay.
It's dusk. If we make it to a main street there'll be people there.
We should try to find a way out of this mess...
Wait.
Here we go!
1,
2,
We're sorry!
Sis, you moron! We made a fool of ourselves!
But it looks like it was a misunderstanding after all!
However...
This was nothing but the prelude to the terrifying incident that was about to unfold.
See you later!
She's off early again.
It's for her play.
Yukino's an actor as she is, so why does she need to practice?
Dear, you know how it is.
The springtime of her life, huh?
That's right!
My battle began on that day.
Seconds please!
What's wrong, Kano?
Tsuki hasn't noticed.
She's convinced that that incident yesterday was a misunderstanding.
But I can see it.
The dark shadow, following me...
You didn't see it at all.
Morning. What's the matter?
Don't you stand behind me!
Who?
Kano's been reading too many books.
Well, I'll go on ahead.
Can't let your gloomy mood drag me down or I'll bomb first-period English!
Is something bothering you?
Yeah, a little...
What?
Come to think of it, I've seen her around a lot lately.
I think she's in 2-D...
Who on earth could the shadow be?
There are cases of people getting caught up in a crime without their knowledge...
Wait, dad's lottery ticket they must be after them...
No... it couldn't be.
We haven't even won yet. However...
I'm home. Is anyone here?
Mom? Sis?
Y-yes... this is the... Miyazawa residence...
Hello? Hello, mom? Hello
I'm home.
Maybe it's someone who likes you, Kano.
What the heck are you thinking? I can't believe you.
You're still talking about that?
I told you it's your imagination.
But even today...
Wow, you're so popular!
Sis!
What, you wanna rumble?
I'm going to the bathroom.
I swear! Those sisters of mine are no help at all.
Why...
You're sure taking your time.
Tsuki...
See, I told you! That girl from 1-D is following
Kano around because she likes her!
That happens sometimes.
Maybe it's admiration.
At the stage when they're still not comfortable with boys...
That's so beautiful.
Well, good luck Kano.
Thanks a lot!
Well, I'm too busy right now,
between love, the play, and studying.
You understand, right?
And I'm doing the maze and the bazaar.
I thought you said it's supposed be all helter-skelter and muddled.
The helter-skelter part just started.
Kano, you're always reading those difficult books,
so solve this one yourself.
Oh, it's wonderful to be young!
My two sisters are heartless.
My father realized it's not a guy so he could care less.
I have no allies.
Love is something you have to face by yourself...
Wait, why am I taking this seriously?!
Hey, isn't that the girl? Why don't you go talk to her?
No way!
Then I will!
You'd better be careful.
Maybe that dark shadow following me around was the girl from 2-D
Then what was that figure this morning...
Miyazawa-san!
Kano, this way!
Tsuki.
What am I doing?
But first, we have to get out of here fast.
Let's go.
Hey, what's going on anyway?
Say something, will you?! Wait!
You OK?
I'm sorry. I can't tell you now.
But please trust me.
I trust you.
I won't have it! I WON'T HAVE IT!!
Dad...
I changed my mind.
Nobody will dare marry my little princess, not even a girl!
What're you talking about, Dad?
We're not going to get... married or...
Get married? I said, don't take this seriously.
Oh?
What's this?
A gentian. So pretty!
Oh! Let's see... I'm always watching you.
In short, I am at a loss.
Excuse me, What would you do if a girl you didn't know told you she liked you?
I'd be happy.
It's all cool with me.
Sorry, I don't understand that kind of thing.
Being liked by someone is so bewildering.
There are no words to describe it.
Well, this sounds like a good opportunity for an armchair love counselor like you.
Experience increases your understanding...
But I honestly don't need to experience this kind of thing.
Oh, there you are, Kano.
She had this threatening look on her face. Is this a challenge?
That girl?
Yeah, that girl.
After school.
The school back yard. And make sure she doesn't run away!
If she said all that, what's this for?
Isn't it just a formality?
It's a challenge after all.
Come on, come with me.
You can be my chaperone, or just a witness.
What are you talking about?
This is serious! I'm scared.
So a crisis finally befell even you, the theorist!
What should I do, what should I do?
If she, you know, starts crying all of a sudden, or...
How could you! How could you dump me!
Well, that's not what I mean...
Let me die! If we can't be together, I'd rather die!
Tsuki... you're laughing too much.
I've decided.
I'm just going to take the plunge.
You're going to plunge?
Nothing's going to happen anyway.
I'm just going to say how I feel right now.
Want me to go with you?
That's okay. I'm just going to plunge.
Don't secretly watch or anything.
Of course I won't!
Ooh, there she is waiting.
What a strange turn of events, don't you think, Rika-chan?
When it gets this far even her cool is affected.
I gotta say it. I gotta say it.
On your mark... get set!
Do you like me or something? Do you like me or something?
What?
Like me... aren't you the one who's after me?
I'm not after you! You're the one!
You're looking at me all the time!
I looked at you because you were there. I mean, aren't you the one who was always following me?
At school, and on the way home, and you were even looking up at me in front of my house!
I live in the neighborhood, so I can't help it! I have to go that way to get home.
Why were you looking at me?
Because you were looking at me!
What about you?
Because you were looking at me...!
Too self-conscious?
Way too much.
I thought you were staring at me all the time...
That's what I thought too.
I thought, she must've fallen for me.
Yeah, me too.
And then I started blushing myself...
And turning away if I made eye contact...
And losing sleep worrying...
And thinking that I'd have
to take responsibility.
What, they solved it?
Thank goodness. Kano, I'm sorry.
What, so both of you were jousting the windmill?
Yeah, seems Megumi-chan was troubled too.
So her name's Megumi-chan?
Yeah, Megumi-chan the armchair love counselor.
Birds of a feather huh?
This is great.
Well, we didn't become a couple, but we did become friends.
Huh? Then what about that gentian?
Tsuki...
Tsukino?
Yeah. It was all her evil plot.
Evil plot huh?
Tsuki had Yurika follow me around. Can you believe that?!
But Kano always looks so unruffled and all-knowing and couldn't care less no matter what happens,
so it just makes me want to have a little fun with her.
That's true.
Sis, not you too!
So in the beginning, it was just to scare me,
but after Megumi-chan came into the picture,
they changed plans and got the gentian!
It was more fun that way!
Tsukino... maybe you're... picking on Kano too m...
What?
Why, Why...?
Will you accept the gentian this time?
What? Then was the gentian last time for me too?
I just assumed that was to trick Kano...
I gave them to you.
What? But why me...?
I'd always thought Kano had such a nice sister...
Oh, I get it. So that's it!
Otherwise, there's no way
Yurika would have helped her fool me.
Would you please be my sister?
Um... I...
Tsuki.
Kano! Help... me...
Solve this one by yourself!
Sis thoughtlessly doesn't realize that something's wrong with Arima-kun!
But unrelated to that,
Tonami Takefumi finally realizes his feelings!
And people don't realize what's going on!
If you want to know, pls. See next Act.
