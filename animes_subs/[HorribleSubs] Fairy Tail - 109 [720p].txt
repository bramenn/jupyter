It's time for the ever-popular segment...
Let's start with the first postcard.
What is Grimoire Heart after?
We've been ordered to capture Lord Zeref and to wipe out Fairy Tail.
Next postcard.
What's Gray-san's type?
P.S. I'd rather have more Gray-san and less Hikaru.
B-But, this is my segment!
What? That's it?
Enough of that!
In the last episode, Lucy figured out the location of Master Mavis's grave,
but Cana put her to sleep for some reason.
It's all oh crap! and stuff.
Lucy Fire!
W-What?
Who are you?
Don't tell me... One of the 7 Kin of Purgatory?
Huh? Where's Cana?
Hey, where's Cana?!
I dunno.
What did you do with her?
I really don't know, but what does it matter?
What's that supposed to mean?
Because you are going to die here.
Did I get separated from Cana somehow?
And... I was asleep?
What'll I do? I don't know what's going on!
I don't know... But I have to do something about this guy.
You can give me all the evil eye you want!
I ain't scared or nothin'.
Not a bit.
Because I'm Kain Hikaru, one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory of Grimoire Heart.
I'm powerful, see.
It doesn't matter how powerful you are!
What's important is that you've stood against our guild!
I'll take you on, so come at me!
W-Wait just a second.
It's all like, bristly here...
Isn't that your own hair?
Whoa, this guy's a piece of work.
Let's do this.
I'll show you my magic, Visit at the Ox Hour!
Even the name gives me the creeps...
Curse
Now then, hand over one of your hairs.
Visit at the Ox Hour needs one of your hairs!
N-No!
If I stick your hair into Mr. Cursey here, I can move you exactly how I wish!
It's an extremely powerful curse magic!
That makes me even less likely to give it to you!
Don't tell me you just realized this!
But wait, I've never heard of magic like that.
That's gotta be a bluff.
B-Bluff?
No, the doll's name is Mr. Cursey. Weren't you listening?
No, bluff means that you're exaggerating and you can't really do it.
I-I never lie!
Did I just hit a nerve I shouldn't have?
What now?!
If you think so, why don't you try it?
How?
This is my own bristle.
Stick it into Mr. Cursey, and...
A bristle is a coarse, dry hair.
Finished!
Man, this guy's a pain.
Go ahead, try it!
So?
Can't you feel the extreme magic power?
Feel free to hug it or kiss it!
Actually, I'm a little hungry...
H-Hey, you...
Give it back!
Breakdance!
The llama position.
The pigeon position.
The scallop position.
That's enough already!
Three embarrassing pin-up poses in a row!
You're enjoying this, aren't you?
No, I'm not!
Give it back!
I'm mad now!
Even if you ask me to go out with you, it's too late!
Our little tete-a-tete ends now!
When did we change to a soap opera?
From now on, I'm cold-hearted!
I don't have time to play around, either!
I'm not playing!
I'm always totally serious!
Why do I also get these types?
Gate of the Golden Bull, I open thee!
Taurus!
A Celestial Spirit Wizard?
And one of the 12 Zodiac Gates?
You bastard!
How dare you attack Lucy-san with that lascivious look on your face!
You look delicious...
Can I have a bite?
You cannot!
And I'm not delicious!
Taurus, show him what one of the strongest Spirits in the Spirit World can do!
This time I'm gonna finish it good!
He got finished good!
I lost... in a battle of power?
That cow-looking thing's made me even hungrier!
No way...
Hold it!
He's even stronger without magic!
What's with this guy?
And he's fast, too!
Running...
Gotta slow him down...
That's it!
Gate of the Centaur, I open thee!
Sagittarius!
Yes-moshimoshi!
Now it's a horse!
Aim for his legs... Shoot!
Understood, as it were!
Furthermore, I am not a food source, as it were-moshimoshi!
Dadasturn!
He kicked them back?!
No way!
I-I've failed!
I do apologize, Lucy-dono...
Sagittarius...
Gate of the Scorpion, I open thee!
Scorpio!
We are!
Leave this to me! Yeah!
Anyway, I'm on vacation with Aquarius right now.
I'll finish this up quick and get right back to her, yeah!
Oh, really?
T-Tell her I said hi,'kay?
I'm a little scared about afterwards, though.
On vacation with your girlfriend?!
I'm not jealous in the slightest, got it?
Sand Buster!
Show me some tastier Spirits than this sandy scorpion, okay?
Impossible? My sand was just...
Nothing is working!
If sand won't work, I don't have any reason to be here.
There you have it!
What's with this guy?
Mr. Cursey still has my hair in him.
So if I change the material that Mr. Cursey is made out of...
It changes yourself, too?!
Mr. Cursey, change!
From iron, to...
Shining Sumo Push!
I might not look like it, but I'm one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory... I'm powerful.
Now out with something tastier!
In that case, a Spirit like this might actually work.
Gate of the Lesser Dog, I open thee!
Nicolas!
So cute!
People say I'm cute, but this guy's at another level!
Hand him over!
That made things worse!
Cancer, handle this!
Been a good while-ebi.
It's a crab!
You don't call me much, so I'd thought you'd forgotten about me-ebi.
So, how would you like your hair-ebi?
You really don't get the situation, do you?
He's your opponent.
Why is he readying a pot of boiling water-ebi?
Whatever, just give him such an embarrassing cut he can't show his head in public!
Okay-ebi!
Ebi!
Ebi!
Embarrassing-ebi!
What-ebi?
No way! My special scissors-ebi!
My bristles aren't so weak.
Now that's some crazy hair-ebi!
Ebi!
Alright, then... Please, Aries!
Okay! I'll try my best!
You're mine!
I-I'm sorry...
W-Why are you apologizing?
Because... I'm going to cause you trouble...
I'm sorry!!
Wait!
You silly... I never thought that you... were a burden.
Really?
Really!
Can I leap into your arms?
Into my arms? Seriously?!
I'm sorry!
Now, come to me...
You've always been such a baby...
We might've just met, but... I'm sorry?
Do it now.
Wool Bomb!
Did I do it right?
It's fine... Where did you get such acting chops?
Oh, that was Leo.
Listen up, Aries.
All men are simpletons, so you can be of help to Lucy this way.
N-No comment.
Is my devotion such a burden?!
He's angry!
My Spirit combo's been wiped out!
I'm sorry!
Okay, enough playing around.
I'm going to get serious now.
Change Mr. Cursey's material to cotton!
I'll finish you with this!
Change myself to iron!
Natsu, hang in there!
Don't get all upset.
That didn't work on me at all.
I've got to pay you back for Galuna Island.
Beating you too quickly would be boring.
Play with me a little longer, would you?
She's way stronger than she was before!
I didn't use even half of my power back then.
Time to get crushed!
Move it!
What?
Natsu?
Lucy? Why are you here?
Same to you, Natsu!
But thanks to it, I'm saved.
Lucy came flyin' in from over there... real ugly-like.
Is there any other way to get sent flying?
Kain, what are you doing here?
Ultear-san...
I was chasing that woman.
Natsu, you're fighting, too?
She's mine. You can't have her!
I don't want her!
She's crazy strong!
Even Natsu's having a hard time.
No, I'm not!
I'm gonna beat her!
But, there are two enemies now.
But there are two of us now, too.
For now, let's forget we're rivals in the exam...
We'll reform the team!
Yeah!
This combination brings back the memories...
Yeah! Makes you remember the time we met.
I'm all fired up!
Let's do this, Lucy!
Let's go, Natsu!
I'm here, too!
They're like some happy couple! How dare they!
They're like some happy-go-lucky couple!
2 of the 7 Kin of Purgatory...
I'm all fired up!
Ultear-san, these people aren't worth your time to fight!
I can beat them both myself!
Just me, and I can handle them!
That's not right!
Then it won't be 2 on 2!
Personally, I'd rather it be 2 on 1...
Everyone's completely forgetting about me...
Then I'll leave them to you.
I have to take Zeref to Master Hades, after all.
Oh? You've already discovered him?
But...
Natsu, this is bad!
We can't let them have Zeref!
There's this World of Great Magic thing or whatever...
Anyway, it'll be bad!
And I still have to pay him back for my scarf.
I can't let them have'im'til I punch his face in!
Natsu!
Got it? Don't hold back.
If you feel like showing them just how powerful the 7 Kin of Purgatory are,
no one can stand up to you.
I won't betray your trust, Ultear-san!
I can do it when it counts!
Damn it... Guess I'll beat this guy first!
Then I'll go after her...
What are you doing, Lucy?
I can't move my body!
I plucked a hair when you were running away.
O-Oh, no!
With that hair, you and Mr. Cursey are now one!
You're now completely under my control!
This is for before!
No!
What the heck is going on?
Looks like those two get along.
More than friends, but less than lovers.
None of the above!
Three embarrassing pin-up poses in a row!
You're enjoying this, aren't you?
I am so not!
I've got it!
Lucy is made to move exactly like that doll!
R-Right...
Curse Magic...
Just like it says, it's a Lost Magic where you curse your opponent and attack them.
The Lullaby Flute that Natsu and the others once fought is another example.
Depending on how it's used, Kain Hikaru's Mr. Cursey could well spell doom for the world!
It is truly a fearsome magic, probably!
You heard the man!
What'll we do, Natsu?
Do the bunny!
Stop him!
That looks like fun!
It's not fun for me!
How about you beat up your pal?
Natsu, dodge!
Roar of the...
Don't touch my ass!
Natsu's getting beaten up by Lucy...
And we're not even in Edolas...
What the hell was that for, Lucy?
It's not me doing it!
Why, you...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
This is more annoying than I thought.
Don't move!
What power!
Do you get more powerful when you're under that thing's control?
What the hell are you doing with her?
No lovey-dovey on my watch!
We aren't lovey-dovey!
They lllike each other...
Let go!
If you wanna do funny business with me watching, do it like this!
Hug him until his bones break!
Hold him to the bone so he can never get away!
Pump him so full of your feelings he flies into the sky!
The power of Visit at the Ox Hour is far more than this.
Next, tragedy will befall the two...
H-Huh?
Mr. Cursey, where did you go?
Natsu, Lucy, I stole his doll!
You thieving cat!
Nice going, Happy!
All right!
Don't play around!
Give it back!
Gotcha!
Talons of the Fire Dragon!
Damn it!
What the hell is this guy?
He's the opposite of how he looks!
He's fast and limber!
You think an official guild can actually beat Grimoire Heart?!
Natsu!
Crap!
I-I can't get free!
Stay put! I'll get Virgo to free you!
No...
I've run out of magic power now?
Lucy, behind you!
Watch out!
Lucy!
Damn it!
I can't get out!
Now watch as I finish her off.
You bastard!
Not if I can help it!
Take this, and that, and this, and that!
Enough playing around.
I'm sorry Natsu, Lucy...
Happy...
Run, Lucy!
He's a lot stronger than he looks!
I'll handle him somehow, so run!
No.
Running away by myself? No way.
It's always more fun when we're together!
I'm cold-hearted.
I'll crush that cute little face of yours flat.
Lucy!
I'm awkward, you see.
I'll do this right at once.
M-My body's moving on its own!
Why, you...
Dodge him, Lucy!
You're bending my body too much!
Able to move her body freely, without restraint!
Ultimate Lucy is on the scene!
Natsu, please keep my joints in mind,'kay?
What's this?
This... might actually work!
I just had an even better idea!
Iron Fist... of the Fire Dragon!
No way!
Don't worry! It's not hot for the person using it!
I think!
I think, he says!
Happy!
Aye, sir!
What are you planning?
Max speed!
Aye!
I'm gonna die here!
Max speed!
What is that?
Um, is there a reason my entire body is on fire now?!
Lucy Fire!
By combining Natsu's fire powers with Happy's speed,
through Mr. Cursey, Lucy became a flaming ball of magic power,
which landed a direct hit on Kain Hikaru.
We did it!
Aye, sir!
We won!
At times like this...
Do a victory pose!
Yay!
Please, no more...
Natsu, I'm through... I can't move any more.
Suck it up, Happy!
You're gonna retire before doing anything the slightest bit productive? That's so lame.
You just have a knack for drilling a hole right into the heart, you know that?
I was just letting everyone else have their time in the sun, you see?
Yeah, thanks a bunch for that.
Next time: Dead-End of Despair.
Just so you know, I haven't even gotten serious yet!
I'm really, totally awesome!
Sure, fine, hurry up and be awesome then.
