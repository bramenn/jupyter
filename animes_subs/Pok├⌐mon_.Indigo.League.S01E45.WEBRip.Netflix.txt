Ash continues his journey with Misty, Brock, Pikachu
and their Egg-Cellent new companion.
But our heroes are about to be caught in a treacherous web.
Hey, look. A poster! Missing.
- Is that...? - It looks like.
It cant be.
James?
Wow! It sure looks like James.
Have you seen the boy in that photo?
We have if hes James from Team Rocket.
Jolly good. Eureka.
Quick, to the estate.
Hey!
Hmm, this kid looks a lot like you.
You think so? He looks pathetic.
- Thats what she means, James. - Right! We'd better go investigate.
-Yeah. -
- James. - What you waiting for?
-Oh, Ill stay here. - No, you wont.
Hey, mister, how much farther is this place?
Were almost at the end of the driveway.
Seems like we drove past the main gate about half an hour ago.
- Whoa! - Huh?
-Look at that. -Its huge.
Mm-hm. Ive seen shopping malls smaller than this place.
- wow! - It must have 100 rooms.
Its the biggest mansion Ive ever seen.
- That is not the mansion! -
This little dog house is for Growlie, the favorite Pokemon of Master James.
Huh?
Behind you there, that building is the masters mansion.
Whoa.
Please, follow me.
-Oh, wow. -Yeah.
Were in the lap of luxury.
Yay! We hit the jackpot.
Oh. Huh?
Coffins? Was there a funeral here?
My master and mistress had only one child, a boy named James.
This morning, his parents passed away and this estate is now his.
You mean that this whole estate is going to belong to James.
-Ah! James! -Is this place really yours?
I suppose.
Its so frightfully tragic. After Master James ran away,
his parents no longer had the strength to go on.
Their hearts were broken.
Thats so sad.
And now theyre... I hope you find James to tell him real soon.
-Real soon wont do. -
His parents will clearly states
that Master James must marry his fiance within 24 hours of their passing away.
If not, this entire estate will no longer belong to him
but will be donated to charity. I must find him at once.
We should help look for James.
What? why should we help him after all the trouble hes caused us?
He may want to come to his parents funeral.
I mean, its his last chance to say good bye to them.
Gee, I didnt think of that.
But well never find him in just one day.
- No. Never! - Careful, James!
Whoa!
Stop that. Jamess parents just passed away.
-Hes got to come to their funeral. -Never!
Uh, uh.
Look, James, were becoming very annoyed with you.
Dont you want to become the richest guy in the world?
I dont know.
Oh! I feel like my head is splitting!
I cant remember anything thats happened!
-Whats wrong? -Maybe James has amnesia.
Its all a blur to me.
I remember flunking out of Pokemon Tech and joining a bicycle gang.
I only remember one scene before that.
It was a dark and stormy night.
A boy was wandering far from home with his loyal Growlithe, Growlie.
They were both freezing and they hadnt eaten in days.
Ah. Growlie. Im not going make it.
Leave me alone and save yourself. Oh.
The angels have come for me.
Farewell. I leave this cruel world for a better place.
-Remember me, Grow... -Growlie.
Then the boy departed this world.
Little Growlie howled all night.
-The boy was found frozen solid. -Oh, thats such a sad ending.
-That poor kid. -I cant believe James is gone.
-I miss him. -Pika.
Hmm. James is standing right here!
Ah, thats right. Huh? Hmm?
Im all mixed up!
Who cares? It doesnt matter what you remember. Just take the cash.
But James cant get his inheritance unless he marries some girl in the next 24 hours.
Well fake a wedding and scram with the money.
-Thats ridiculous. -Ridiculous?
Ah. This entire estate will be all yours.
-Yeah! Yeah! -I wont do it!
-Hes weakening. -Hell see it our way.
Ugh! Let me go. I dont want to.
You cant make him get married.
He should be free to decide who he does or doesnt want to marry.
-Put a sock in it. -Keep your dumb opinions to yourselves.
-Pikachu! -This is great.
These invisible costumes are perfect.
Yes? Coming.
They wont fool that butler.
-May I help you, sir? -Its me, James. Ive come back.
Your parents shall be most pleased to see that you have returned.
-Please come in. - Thank you.
Huh?
-They wouldnt have fooled me. - Everything is fine now, masters.
Your little boy James has finally returned home just as you wished.
Oh, Mommy, Daddy. Its true. Im back home at long last to get my money.
-Huh? -Uh, I mean...
Youre blowing it.
Im going to get married, just like it says in your will.
-And I want cash, not a check. -Whats that?
-I mean, Im only joking. Of course. -
Oh, Mom and Dad. I wish Id come back sooner.
- -Huh?
-Hey, whos that? -Prepare for trouble.
-Yes, dear, and make it double. -But theyre...
Theyre ghosts!
Oh, James dear, were so happy youve come back home.
And youre wearing a suit.
-Theyre either alive... -Or theyre real solid ghosts.
They arent ghosts, you furry imbecile.
Its just like them to pull a stunt like this to get me to come back home.
-Does that mean... -You really dont have amnesia?
Huh? Who am I? Where am I?
Why, youre James and youre about to be married.
-Hopkins, begin the preparations. -Yes.
-Ive got to escape. -Oh, no, James.
Youre tying the knot.
Ha, Jessie means youre tying the noose.
So this whole thing was a trap so James would get married.
- -Im proud of you.
You realized you must uphold the family tradition.
As our son and heir, you have certain obligations.
The most important of these is to marry and to continue the family line.
-Right. -Do I have a duty to be manipulated?
I dont know what youre talking about.
We only want whats best for us. I mean, best for you.
A man who cant settle down is like a bumblebee without a nose.
Hell never sniff the daffodils of life.
Youll learn to be a real gentleman once you marry the right girl.
-And here she is. - Huh?
As Jamess wife, it will be your duty
to change him from a worthless do nothing into a respectable gentleman,
-my dear Jessebelle. -As you wish, mother.
Meowth! Her voice is catnip to my ears. Now, thats what I call a real lady,
not a tough, mean, nasty girl like Jessie. Ow!
Ill show you tough, mean and nasty.
My names Jessebelle.
My only wish is to be your devoted and loving wife
and companion and also
to educate you in your duties as a gentleman of property.
Whoa!
-She looks like Jessie! -
Amazing. That girl looks just like Jessie.
-How dare you compare me to that wimp? -Are you kidding?
-You both have exactly the same face. -We do not.
Will you stop arguing? Weve got to get out of here right now.
Dont be ridiculous.
How can we get your inheritance if you dont get married?
Youve got to go through with it.
If you wont get married for yourself, then do it for the team.
Were counting on you to make us all filthy stinking rich.
Forget the team! Im not doing it!
-Im not. -Is something wrong?
Why ever do you keep talking to yourself like that, James?
Talking to yourself?
Meowth and Jessie are right in front of their eyes and nobody notices.
Say, heres an idea.
Lets go down to the vault and count all the money youll inherit.
After you disappeared, your mother and father were so worried about you,
as I was, of course.
But I knew one day youd come back to me.
Im sorry for running away, but everything is going to be just fine
now that Im back here with my money.
-What? -I mean back here with you.
Here we are at the vault. Lets go inside.
Your inheritance is in here.
-Ah. -Ah.
Cha-ching!
-Huh? -Bah uh? Whats all this junk?
What kind of inheritance is this?
Its looks like a lot of weird gym equipment.
Dont you fools get it?
Jessebelle tricked you two into coming down here.
-Huh? -How did she spot us?
Imbeciles!
Your mother and I are tired of waiting for you to grow up.
Huh?
James, its time to face the music.
You cant just do whatever you feel like anymore.
Now youll obey Jessebelle.
-Let the taming begin. - Oh.
Im starting to like you more than her, Jess.
Thanks for the compliment. Hey, get off my head.
They see us.
Everything was fine until you opened that big Meowth of yours.
Do you take us for fools?
We just ignored you until you brought James down here to the dungeon.
-Now you see us... -And now you dont.
Jessie, Meowth. Dont leave me. Ooh! Ooh!
-At last were together. Im so happy. -Eee! Ah!
-You wont escape from me again, James. -
Those two were made for one another, just like you and I, my precious.
Its a perfect match.
If you two werent such lousy parents, youd stop this mad woman.
Shouldnt we try to help him?
I dont like to get involved in these little family squabbles.
Oh, James, I just knew youd fall for me.
-I choose you, Vileplume! -Vileplume.
Hey, whats that?
Vileplume, the flower Pokemon.
Using the largest flower petals in the world,
it spreads large clouds of pollen that cause allergic reactions.
Now Vileplume! Use your Stun Spore to slow James down and keep him from escaping.
Vileplume.
Ah! This is just like this is just like last time. Oh.
Oh!
Heh. Sleeping like a baby.
James, my sweet, Ill make a gentleman out of you yet, even if it destroys us.
-Oh, Hopkins? -Yes?
Would you please get a large broom and sweep up this mess?
-Yes. - Whoa.
Ugh. Well, like they say, even a rose has its thorns.
Shes more like a cactus.
If he marries her, James gets his inheritance.
-If he survives being married to her. -
Hey, whats that?
-Pika, pi! Pikakaka pikaka pi! -Huh? Whats it want?
It wants somebody to open the door of that dog house.
Okay. Ugh. Oh, its locked.
-Come on. Give me a hand here. -Sure, Ash!
-Pika? -Whats that?
James, its time for the wedding.
-Growlie! -Growlie!
-Growlie! -Oh, no!
Now, who let you in here?
-Vileplume, get rid of this horrid thing. -Vileplume.
Run, Growlie!
- -Where are you going? Dont leave.
- -Ruff! Ruff!
Growlie says to go inside.
Ill follow you to the ends of the earth and the bottom of the sea, James dearest.
Ugh. You saved me, Growlie. Thank you.
- Growl! Growl! -
Oh! That tickles, Growlie.
Well, James, that fiancee of yours is truly despicable.
Told you shes just like Jessie.
Ill make your mouth even bigger.
Shes the reason I ran away from this estate.
What a rotten day.
As soon as my engagement to Jessebelle was announced,
she began to follow me everywhere, trying to change me.
Nothing I did was refined enough for her.
Please, leave me alone. I cant stand it.
Growlie?
Where are you going, James?
I havent finished teaching you the correct way to eat spaghetti yet.
-I want to do things my way, Jessebelle! -Youre not running properly.
Let me show you the right way.
Ever since I was a kid,
I hated how upper class society had rules for absolutely everything.
Jessebelle is so rigid, marrying her would be the worst mistake of my life.
Growlie is my only real friend on this stuffy estate.
Mm hmm.
I always wondered what it would be like to grow up in a place like this.
Who wouldve thought being rich could be such a bummer?
-Whats that? -
Now what?
My sweet James, you cant escape me.
Leave me alone.
Vileplume! Stun them to sleep just like before.
-Vileplume. - Oh!
-Now, Pikachu! Electric Shock! -Pikachu!
Keep away from me, you horrid beast!
-Youre the best. Thank you. -Rowr!
Its lunchtime in the pond. Are you hungry, my friends?
-Oh, look! Jessebelle. -Jessebelle.
Oh, what a refined daughter in law shell be.
- Ah! -Im leaving!
-I cant stand that Growlie! -Shes as delicate as a flower.
Shes much too good for our delinquent son.
Well, Growlie, please take good care of my parents.
They need you here. This upper crush high life doesnt suit me.
Im better living the low life with Team Rocket.
-Plus I like my freedom. -Growl.
Please dont cry, Growlie. Its hard enough to leave you.
-So long, Growlie. -Rowl.
Oh, well, guess James chose to hang up his Team Rocket costume.
Eh, I guess all that money and luxury was just too tempting for James to give up.
I guess youre right.
- Prepared for trouble? -Hey, its him!
James?
Make it double.
I guess were not going to get rich this time either.
Guess not. They wouldnt give me the inheritance.
Oh, theres always next time.
We may not make a lot of money, but we sure have got our freedom!
Yeah. Double trouble time, right?
Sounds great to me, James.
Hey, wait! You forgot Meowth again!
Oh, please, wont yall help me find my beloved James?
Believe me, miss,
-hes the one who finds us. -Pikachu!
And so, Ash dashes away from the magnificent estate,
eager to get on with his Pokemon journey.
But has our hero learned anything valuable during his visit?
Well, maybe.
Youre not running properly!
J Pokemon! J
