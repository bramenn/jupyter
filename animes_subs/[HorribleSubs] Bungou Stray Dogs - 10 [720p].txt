Speed: 20 knots Heading out to Open Sea
Don't die, brat!
You call that a punch?!
It doesn't even count as a massage.
Your martial arts skills are below average for the Port Mafia.
Your ability to neutralize gifts is a nuisance,
but I don't even need to use mine at this point.
Get up.
The party's just getting started.
You're not the Port Mafia's top martial artist for nothing.
Whoops.
I thought my blocking arm'd get torn off.
He blocked my strike with his arm at the last second?
He's predicting my attacks.
We've known each other a long time.
I'm totally familiar with your moves, pacing, and habits.
I wouldn't have been a proper partner otherwise, right?
He's fast!
Then I bet you saw this coming, too!
This is how you throw a punch!
You thought you could beat me just because you can predict my moves?
Tell me before you die.
Why'd you let yourself get caught?
What were you waiting for here?
Heh, the silent treatment?
Fine.
I'll just have more fun torturing you.
The main reason...
is Atsushi-kun.
Atsushi?
The weretiger you're all obsessed with.
I wanted to know who put the seven billion yen price tag on his head.
You wanted to know badly enough to put your own life on the line?
I'd like to say that's heartwarming...
but look where you ended up.
Guess even geniuses end up less than average, eh,
youngest executive in the mafia's history?
Well, you've been deserted by lady luck.
After all, you got caught the very day I got back
from suppressing squabbles in the West.
From my perspective, it was a stroke of luck.
What's so funny?
Let me tell you something that's good to know.
There will be a meeting between the top five executives tomorrow.
Impossible.
That's a meeting of critical importance that only occurs once every several years,
to determine what direction to take as an organization.
If there were going to be one,
I would've been notified.
The reason it's happening is a certain letter I sent the other day to
the upper echelons of the organization.
So, I'm going to predict this now.
You're not going to kill me.
Moreover, you'll tell me where to find information on who's paying
the weretiger bounty before leaving this room.
And when you leave, you'll walk and talk like a little rich girl.
What?
My predictions always come true.
I think you know that.
What can you even hope for in this situation?
A letter?
You mentioned a letter?
Should Dazai fall, all of your secrets will come to light.
Should Dazai fall,
all of your secrets will come to light.
You bastard, you didn't...
So now you've caught a former executive turned traitor.
But the package included a letter to the upper echelons
that, if I die, all of the organization's secrets will be disclosed.
If the public prosecutor's office gets a hold of those secrets,
all the Port Mafia executives can be executed a hundred times over.
That's more than enough of a threat to trigger the meeting.
The Port Mafia aren't so feeble that a threat like
that'd make them wait and see what happens.
You'll die!
There will be an execution!
Probably.
But that'll be the council's decision.
If you execute me before that decision without permission,
your unsanctioned act will be considered an act of betrayal.
You'll be discharged or, at worst, executed.
And even if I look past all of those factors and kill you,
you'll just be happy because you managed to die.
So yeah, go ahead if you want.
Come on, hurry.
Come onnn.
Oh...
You're not going to?
Chuuya driven out of the organization because of me
had a nice ring to it, too.
Don't tell me...
The greatest reason...
is Atsushi-kun.
So your second reason was to force me to make that impossible choice just now?
Besides, why'd you come here in the first place?
To harass you.
In actuality, you were waiting to harass me.
It's a reunion long in the making.
A surprise of this caliber is only fair.
I'll have you die...
I'll have you die someday, I swear.
By the way...
You're the one who broke my chains and freed me.
If I just run away now,
you'll be suspected of aiding my escape.
You bastard!
I could make it look like someone from the Agency came to rescue me.
Why should I believe you?!
I don't lie in these kinds of negotiations.
I think you know that.
Bastard...
What do you want?
I said it earlier.
If it's about that weretiger,
Akutagawa's leading the operation.
He should have records in the communications storage room on the second floor.
I see.
Well, I had my guesses about that.
Oh?!
Just finish what you came here for and get outta here, you ass.
Why, thank you.
my dream right now is to commit double-suicide with a beautiful woman,
so being kicked to death by you wouldn't make me happy in the slightest.
Sorry.
Uh-huh.
I'll try to find a beautiful woman willing to kill herself next time.
Chuuya.
I had no idea you were a good person!
It's my way of saying go to hell, idiot!
Let me tell you this, Dazai.
Don't think this is the end of it!
There will be no second chance!
No, wrong!
Don't you think you're forgetting something?
Don't-you-think-you're-forgetting-something?
There will be no second chance.
N-N-No second chance.
Hey, you should be laughing!
Huh?
Did you... come to rescue me?
I struck to kill,
but it seems the tiger's healing power is in effect, if in incomplete form.
Where am I?
Am I at sea?
You're on a smuggling ship that carries weapons and munitions,
though it's been reserved solely for you today.
Enjoy your last voyage for the next few hours before we hand you over.
There's no point.
I can't win against him.
I'll have to find an opening and make a run for it...
The weak will die.
Die, and make way for others.
Why does he have so much hatred for me?
Did you find yourself moved by being in the outside world,
Kyouka?
Let him go.
Do you know what it's like to be at the nadir?
There is only the mire, a foul stench, and self-pity.
At times, someone will look in from an opening far above,
but no one notices you.
With every breath, your wretchedness burns your lungs.
That's what's waiting for you out there, Kyouka.
Demon Snow is slaughter made flesh.
Yet you think you can live a normal life outside of the Port Mafia?
Weretiger, teach her what it's like.
To help no one,
to be counted on by no one,
and to live in hiding, trembling like a worm.
Continue killing, Kyouka,
as the Port Mafia's assassin.
If not, stop breathing.
Worthless human beings don't have the right to breathe.
You may be right...
But...
The crepes were delicious...
Where are you, brat?!
Brat!
Kunikida-san?
So the Agency's found us already?
Run while you still can.
This ship isn't going to reach the meeting spot.
Where else is it going?
The nadir.
Hey!
Run!
Weretiger!
You set explosives in the armory?
You're trying to die, aren't you.
Is that man worth saving at the cost of your life?
Brat!
Over here, brat!
I can't come any closer because of the explosions!
Jump!
I'm making it out alive
I'm safe now.
What are you doing? Hurry up!
The ship's going to sink!
You idiot!
How much more trouble are you going to cause the Agency?
Everyone's working unpaid right now!
What about her?
Let that girl go!
Not all innocents always get saved.
I've failed many times, too!
That's the kind of city we're in, and the job we have!
She can't be saved?
That's right.
We're not heroes.
I've wished so many times that we were.
But we're not!
Brat!
She...
She said the crepe she had with me tasted great.
She was told worthless human beings have no right to breathe,
and she thought maybe that is true.
I don't think so.
Because Dazai-san... the Agency... didn't give up on me!
I'm going!
Hey!
Run!
Run, Atsushi!
Kyouka, is this the path you've chosen?
Out of appreciation for your hard work thus far,
I'll lay you to rest.
Die.
Face me, Akutagawa!
Episode 10 Rashoumon and the Tiger
It now seems curious to me,
but I felt things between us would end this way eventually.
You'll miss out on the bounty.
Don't worry.
I have no intentions of handing you over to them alive.
I can't forgive you.
The same goes for me.
Rashoumon!
It's the same devoured space that stopped bullets before.
As long as it's there, my attacks can't get through.
How futile.
Is this the best you can do, weretiger?
Slow torture is not one of my hobbies.
If you must, curse your own weakness.
You are a weakling who deluded himself into thinking he was strong
for having joined an armed organization like the Agency.
Your membership was merely due to coincidence and luck.
You're quite the talker today.
I don't recall ever identifying myself as a mute.
It's just like you say.
I am weak.
But I do have one advantage.
And what's that?
I can defeat you!
You reversed your tiger paws to free your arms?!
I thought so.
It takes time to activate the devoured space barrier.
I'll just use my speed to push my attacks then!
What?!
I don't have the time to go along with childish fistfights
Sorry, but I'll just observe your efforts from up here!
Having this distance between us works to his advantage.
I have to close the gap somehow...
Shit!
There's less than five minutes left before the ship is completely submerged.
He leapt using a fragment blown from the explosion?
Your ability's slow to activate.
The enemy won't wait for you to get up.
Now, get up.
Retaliate with your ability.
That's not enough to survive in the Port Mafia!
Or perhaps you want to return to being a stray dog in the slums?
Good.
Again.
I have to take her to Kunikida-san before the ship sinks!
Why
Why is it you?!
Your ability is but newly learned, a crude addition...
It's full of flaws and you use it with poor planning!
And yet
Why is it you?!
There it is again.
His hatred for me...
Where does such hatred come from?
I wonder if you can.
My new subordinate is much better than you.
I won't let him say that.
I won't let him say such things ever again!
Rashoumon!
Higanzakura
Higanzakura!
Even if I've defeated him
Wait.
Why...
My attack was a direct strike.
He can't possibly move...
You're so powerful.
Why'd you have to use her?
I didn't use her.
Demon Snow is an ability to kill.
Only when killing someone does Kyouka's existence have meaning.
If she does not kill, she is worthless.
I merely gave her value.
To make her worthy to live.
That's the thing.
You don't get to decide whether someone is worthy of being alive!
Why couldn't you tell her something different?
People need to be told they're worthy of being alive by someone else
or they can't go on.
Why can't you understand
such a simple thing?!
He tore Rashoumon apart?
The tiger's ultra-regeneration!
I can't let him get close!
I'll take him out at this distance!
Rashoumon!
Sawarabi!
Sawarabi
Akutagawa...!
Rashoumon!
Goku
Goku Mon
Mon
Agito!
Agito
Just fall.
The tiger's tail
Devoured Space
Devoured Space!
My new subordinate is much better than you
You big idiot
Well done.
So...
Who in the world wanted to spend seven billion to buy a tiger?
They're...
It's time.
Leader of The Guild, A Gifted Organization Francis F.
It seems the bounty approach has failed.
The island mafia are such a half-baked lot.
Ability: The Great Gatsby
The Promised Land will be The Guild's for certain.
A challenging task even the police passed on
has come to our Agency.
Atsushi, give it a try.
Okay, I'll do my best!
What?
Kenji's the one going to the job site with Atsushi?
I can't believe we already have a lead!
Kenji-kun, you're amazing!

First, an Unsuitable Profession for Her. Second, an Ecstatic Detective Agency.
Shit...
It's the best and worst team ever.
