H!
O?!
I do fall in love!
I just realised it for the first time
That I had fallen in love
Twenty-four hours a day thinking of you, you and nothing more than you!
It's something I wasn't consciously aware of
Somehow ( somehow) I'm feeling different from the usual
With you ( the two of us) and our dull chatter
Don't tell me ( mutual love?) Nope, it's a one-sided crush
This is bad! Our gazes met!
What, what? Why is my heart pounding like this?
Did a short circuit just make a mess out of my mind?
This is my first time... feeling like this...
I wonder if I have a fever
Suddenly and precipitately, love has arrived.
Instantly igniting my face into a bright red
T-That's stupid?! My hands are shaking
Is this really what they call love?
I-I did it! A conversation filled with stutters
This awkward silence... *mumble mumble*
Your... ( Your...) I want to know your feelings.
O-One-sided love
First love! The usual way to school
The shining light. I do fall in love!
I feel I could fly towards the sky
O-One-sided love

H H!
Woke up in the morning, brushed my teeth
In the blink of an eye, it's 10pm
Today, we laughed a whole lot
We had a great time
At times, with my friends, acting like fools, being noisy
Fluttering, our eyes met.
It's a coincidence, right?
I wouldn't call this my first love
It's not my character.
Say, will we be able to meet again tomorrow?
As my eyelids close
I see you sparkling all over the place
Today was fun, too, wasn't it?
I'm in love
So happy, so happy
It is my pleasure to meet you, my new-found love.
Surely, we'll meet again tomorrow
Have a good night
We'll meet immediately in our dreams
So have a good night

Narration: Ogata Megumi
I'm hungry.
It's the kid.
Doing this kind of thing again...
Well, if the traps are of this level, I don't mind getting trapped.
At least it's food.
You got caught!
You got caught!
I literally got the stick.
Hey!
This was going to be the side dish for today's lunch.
We don't have one now.
Sakamoto.
You're the criminal, too.
No, Sakamoto said he wanted to eat it.
No, I did not!
Why do you start saying things like this?
Well, you did eat it.
Hey! Let's go eat ice cream from in front of the station!
Hm?
Hey, kid.
Don't you think she wants to go to school?
I don't want you to go!
What's with this, all of a sudden?
Nano is going to go somewhere...
Eh?
Who said that?
Sakamoto.
That's not what I meant!
Nano, are you going somewhere?
I am thinking of going shopping in the morning...
Professor will come along with you, too!
I won't buy you anything.
I want to buy Chocolate Sharks!
I won't buy that.
Buy some!
Chocolate Sharks!
I said that I won't buy them.
Buy some! Buy some!
I won't buy them.
Sakamoto said to buy some!
I did not!
Mio-chan.
Good morning.
Whoa. What's wrong, Yukko?
You're all unsteady!
People have been telling me that since this morning.
The balance of your speech is having a Gestalt Breakdown!
Seems like you have a fever, too.
Why did you come to school in that state?
Well, you see...
I was thinking that I'd show you that magic show I've been telling you about.
What are you talking about?
I haven't heard anything about that.
You're in no state to be talking about magic.
I even practised, so you'll be surprised when you see my magic!
I can't wait.
The truth is that I'm already surprised.
First of all, take your sea -
What!?
Yukko...
I can already...
I'll just pretend that I didn't see that.
She did come all this way in that state.
But Yukko was going bring out a big trick -
I-It already came out!
It already came out!
Ah.
It escaped!
Tissues...
All right.
Let's begin.
Okay.
Why am I hiding this?
Well, let's see...
First off...
I wonder how weakened she is that she didn't notice the dove and the wand.
I'll pass a cigarette through a one hundred-yen coin.
The hole is already open!
They're all Ace of Hearts!
Just now,
something came flying out of her mouth.
What kind of trick were you planning?
Yukko!
Yukko.
You should just sleep right now.
Well, I'm off to the supermarket.
Professor shall come with you!
Since you weren't behaving, I wont buy you anything!
I feel bad for you, Sakamoto.
It's you!
Well, let's go.
What are you buying today, Nano?
More fish, I guess.
What should Professor get?
Professor can't buy anything today!
But they're not snacks, though...
You can't buy anything, even if they're not snacks.
Then I'm not too sure what I can buy.
You really do want to buy something.
Nano, it's a shark castella!
It looks like there's a stand.
Since it looks delicious, shall we have some?
Geez.
Have you forgotten already?
I'm not buying anything for you today.
Eh?
But it's a gift for Sakamoto.
Sakamoto did some bad things, too, so no.
I was going to give it to Nano, actually.
I made a mistake.
If I treat her here, she'll do the same thing again.
All right, Professor.
We're going.
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
I need to clear my mind.
But maybe...
But right now...
Or maybe...
No!
Maybe just a bit...
No way!
But...
No, no!
Maybe...
I'm sorry.
I lost.
It's delicious!
So in the end, you bought it for her.
This kid is really selfish,
always throwing tantrums for some reason or another.
I think I'll teach her a lesson.
Hey, kid.
Hurry up and learn about self-restraint.
I understand.
No, you don't!
The Shinonome household was at peace again today.
Whoa! You got eighty points! Amazing!
You can do it if you try!
What's the secret behind that good mark?
No, no, no. There really is no secret.
Come on!
Tell me your secret!
Stop!
Ow...
Should I teach you the secret to getting eighty points?
You don't have to tell me.
Besides, I got ninety-six points.
Eighty points.
It's all about effort...
Crude.
Aioi.
Uh...
Eh?
Yeah!
Dad, I've come to make food for you!
Mum's still on her trip, right?
Oh, thanks.
Hello!
Hello, Mii-chan.
Well, I'll play with my grandson all day today...
Mii-chan, what do you want to do today?
You see, you see!
Instead of that, where is your registered seal?
TL note: An official stamp that can be used in place of a signature. Someone else could forge legal documents in your name with it.
Eh?
Hey, hey!
Where is your seal?
Where are you hiding it?
Hey, hey!
Tell me!
Is it in this bookshelf?
Hey, hey!
Where is your seal?
This is worse than reality.
Hey, hey! Where is it?
Where? Where?
Come out right no -
You're slow!
What did you think the time to meet up was?
I'm sorry.
I meant to get on the bus...
I was on a wave known as time.
Let's just go to town like this!
Nano.
Ah!
Hey, Nano?
Nano?
What is it, Professor?
I kinda need to go pee a little bit.
Nano, come with me.
Hey, lets go.
Hey...
Lets go.
Hey, Nano.
Hey...
Professor, you're wrong...
Eh? What is?
Borscht is a type of food.
TL note: Borscht is a type of Eastern European soup.
That's not it.
I want to go pee.
Hey, Nano.
Nano!
Just go!
Did you possibly...
It's okay, only a little.
Anyway, just hurry up and go to the washroom.
I'll sleep.
Just go!
Sakamoto was being careful not to speak too loudly.
Geez.
It can't be helped.
This is why I hate kids.
I guess she can't go to the bathroom alone this late at night when a storm like this is raging...
For now,
I'll go with her and make her feel grateful to me again.
Hey, kid.
It can't be helped, so I'll go with you.
Sakamoto is small and looks weak, so it's fine.
Don't you think she wants to go to school?
Oh, Professor, you came over here?
Nano, come go pee with me.
Well, I don't really need to, but...
I'm just a tiny bit scared, so come with me.
Ah.
You should have just woken me up.
I tried to, a lot!
It's making a lot of noise.
Maybe someone's here.
It's probably the chimney banging around.
But it's raining really hard.
Nano, what's wrong?
Ah!
Hey, Nano?
Professor, Professor...
It's the thunder...
It's all right. The professor is here.
Let's just get this over with and go back to our futons.
It might be scary alone, but I think it's okay if we're together.
I guess that's true.
Nano, do you want to go to school?
Eh?
No, I'll stay at home forever.
But Sakamoto said that Nano wants to go to school!
I guess that's true.
Things you think are cool!
Eighty points!
Annoying.
A month goes by so quickly, yet Sundays always seem so far away.
Next stop is the eightieth one.
Eightieth stop.
The exit is to the right.
Annoying.
I'll sing you a song about 80s, since it's 80 points.
Annoying.
Eighty points, hooray!
Eighty points, hooray!
Eighty points, hooray!
Eighty points, hoo -
Fall in to Eden!
All right. Listen up!
I'll announce the average score for this test.
The average was ninety-two points.
Yukko.
Stop!
Just stop already.
Hey, kid. What the heck are you doing so suddenly?!
What are you doing?
Stop playing around and help me fold up the laundry.
You can go to school starting tomorrow.
Eh?
Are you serious?
Yes.
What's with this, all of a sudden?
It's the Professor's wise decision.
Yay!
Now I can eat lots of snacks in the afternoon and not get in trouble.
But Professor, I won't be able to wear a backpack like this.
TL note: In Japan, backpacks are only worn by elementary school students.
You're going to high school.
But Professor, you'll have to take off this key, or else -
It's Nano's school uniform.
I love you so much, Professor!
Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano!
Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor!
Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano!
Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor!
Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano! Nano!
Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor!
Nano! Nano! Nano...
Professor! Professor! Professor...
I'm the flags of the world.
You often hear it pronounced both bankokki and bankokuki in Japanese,
but both are correct.
Don't sweat the small stuff!
Those were father's last words.
Next time on Nichijou: Episode 14.
Look forward to it!
