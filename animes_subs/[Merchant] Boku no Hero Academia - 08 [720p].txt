'Cause I'm better than you!
I can't see you even if I tried.
You're so lucky, Kacchan.
Your Quirk's so cool!
I hope I get mine soon, too.
No matter what Quirk you get, you'll never beat me.
He's just a pebble!
Until a little while ago...
You have got a flashy Quirk there, don't you?!
Hey!
You tricked me, didn't you?!
Was it fun tricking me all this time?!
Try and get me with it!
'Cause I'm way above you!
What the?
Improvised special move
Comet Home Run!
You call that a home run?!
Retrieved!
From the start, you were...
I wasn't...
Because I can't use it...
Because my body...
Mr. Aizawa too...
But...
Someone told me...
You can become a hero...
That's why...
I'm going...!
Indoor person-to-person combat training...
Uraraka?!
Hero team...
What the heck?
The losers are practically uninjured...
They lost the battle, but won the war, huh?
This is training, though.
To the nurse's office.
I know.
My right...
Deku predicted it...
On top of that...
You're an amazing person, so that's why I want to beat you!
I want to win...
Does that mean...
Come back, young Bakugou.
It's time to review the results.
Whether you win or lose...
Well, even if I say that...
It's not either of the winners, Ochako or Midoriya?
Hmm, well...
Why is that?
Does anyone know?!
Yes, Mr. All Might.
That is because Iida adapted the most to the context of the training.
From watching the match, it appears Bakugou acted on his own because of an obviously personal grudge.
And as Mr. All Might said earlier...
In the same way, taking into consideration the damage he received...
As for Uraraka...
She let her guard down mid-battle...
If she treated the papier-mache as a real weapon...
Iida had prepared for his opponent's arrival...
The hero team only won because they took advantage of the fact that this was training.
They were practically breaking the rules.
She said more than I expected.
W-Well, young Iida also has parts of him that could be more relaxed...
We should always start with the basics to develop depth of learning.
We must strive to devote ourselves wholeheartedly.
Otherwise, we cannot become top heroes.
Yaoyorozu Momo!
One of four students admitted to the hero course based on recommendations!
All right everyone, let's change locations and start the second match.
Tackle this training after thinking about what we just talked about.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Match two!
Duo B are the heroes!
Duo I are the villains!
Ojiro.
I'm going to get serious!
I'll take off my gloves and boots, too!
O-Okay...
Hagakure, that's the correct decision as an invisible person,
but that's not great for a girl, morally speaking.
You can't look, okay?
I can't see you anyway.
Now, let s start the second indoor person-to-person combat training match!
Shouji Mezou!
Quirk: Dupli-Arms!
He can create replicas of his own body parts on the tips of his tentacles.
One in the hall on the north side of the fourth floor.
The other is somewhere on the same floor...
They're barefoot...
The invisible one is coming to ambush and capture us, huh?
Go outside.
It's dangerous.
I'm sure our opponents intend to fight a defensive battle...
Owww...
My feet!
Th-This Quirk is...!
You can move if you want...
He did not cause any damage to his teammate or the nuclear weapon,
and on top of that, he weakened the enemy.
He's so strong!
Hero team wins!
Heat?
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!
Sorry.
The difference in our ability was too great.
Todoroki Shouto!
He's another one of the four admitted to the hero course based on recommendations.
His Quirk is Half-Cold, Half-Hot.
He freezes with his right and burns with his left!
The range and temperature of his ability is unknown?!
What is he, a monster?!
W-Wow!
What's up with that Quirk?
As expected of someone who got in through recommendations.
All right, everyone gather round for a review of the second match.
Next, we will begin the third match!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Ribbit, ribbit.
No, no, no, no!
Yahoo!
Sorry, sorry!
Good work everyone!
We didn't have any major injuries other than young Midoriya, either!
You guys took this on seriously!
You all did a good job for your first training!
To have such a proper class after Mr. Aizawa's class...
We're free to have proper classes, as well!
Well then, I must review the results with young Midoriya!
Change and return...
All Might's amazing!
Why was he in such a hurry?
So cool...
Young Bakugou...
As his teacher, I must counsel him well.
But right now...
If I teach a class...
Shit!
The school year has just begun,
and he's already been in here three times!
Why didn't you stop him, All Might?!
I apologize, Recovery Girl.
What are you apologizing to me for?
On top of his total exhaustion, he was here just yesterday.
I can't treat him all at once.
I did first-aid treatment already,
so after the IV is finished, we can only wait for his body to heal slowly overnight.
Jeez...
I know he's your favorite and that you passed on your powers to him, but doesn't mean you should spoil him!
There is nothing I can say to that.
Because I wanted to consider his feelings...
Even so...
Yes, yes, Mr. Natural-Born Hero.
Mr. Symbol of Peace.
My injury and this form of mine are common knowledge among the U.A. teachers and a certain group of pros...
I know it's not like you want to rest on your laurels at the top...
If I no longer am, then the superhuman society will be seized by evil.
This is...
If that's the case, then it's even more important for you to learn what it means to guide someone!
Yes, ma'am.
You...
Will you accept my power?
One For All...
Smash...!
Come, young Midoriya.
This is your...
I have a lot to learn from here on out...
My Deku isn't always going to mean useless!
Kacchan...
It's... late afternoon...?
Are you awake?
That's all for today's treatment.
Come back again tomorrow, okay?
I ended up skipping my afternoon classes...
Mr. Aizawa's gonna wrap me in those bindings again...
Oh, Midoriya's here!
Good work!
Man, I don't know what you were saying during the match,
but you were fired up!
I can't believe you fought evenly with Bakugou, who was first in the entrance exam!
You did a good job dodging!
You guys did that in the first match, so the rest of us had to give it our all, too.
You were far from elegant, but
You did a good job dodging!
H-Huh?
I'm Kirishima Eijirou!
We're all going over the training together right now.
I'm Sero Hanta.
I'm Aoyama Yu
I'm Ashido Mina!
You did a good job dodging!
I'm Asui Tsuyu.
Call me Tsu.
I'm Sato!
Um...
Er
I'm Mineta!
Where the heck did you pop out from?
I am Aoyama Yuuga.
You did terrible in the training.
I am a man who never stops shining.
You're too loud.
Tokoyami!
That desk is not a chair!
Get off immediately!
It's not that big a deal, is it?
Wh?!
What's with those hands, anyway?
You people...
I cannot condone actions that disrespect the desks
the great men and women who are our upperclassmen once used!
You're too loud.
Iida never wavers, does he?
Hey, Uraraka, wanna grab a bite to eat sometime?
What do you like?
Mochi
Wait, Deku, she didn't heal your injuries?
Oh, uh, it's because of how much stamina I have, and...
Huh?
Um, Uraraka... more importantly...
We all tried to stop him,
but he went home just now without saying anything.
Hey!
You tricked me, didn't you?!
Was it fun tricking me all this time?!
You have got a flashy Quirk there, don't you?!
Kacchan!
Kacchan!
Huh?
It's a secret I didn't even tell my mom.
But...
There's one thing...
My Quirk...
Huh?
I can't say who I got it from, though!
I won't say.
But... it's like a story out of comic books, except it's true.
On top of that, I still can't control it properly.
It's just a borrowed power that I haven't made my own yet.
That's why...
But in the end, I couldn't win and had to rely on it.
I've still got a long way to go...
That's why...
That's why...!
One day...
I just came to tell him I didn't trick him...
What am I...?
What the hell is that?
Borrowed power?
You're talking nonsense.
What are you trying to do, make me out to be more of a fool than you already have?
Huh?!
What are you trying to say?
Today, I lost to you...!
That's all it was...!
That's all!
As I watched the ice guy...
Damn it!
I ended up agreeing with what that ponytail girl said!
Damn it!
Damn it, damn it!
Hey, you too, Deku!
I'm just...!
I'm just getting started!
You hear?!
Here, I will become number one!
You won't beat me again, bastard!
There he is!
Young...
Just so you know...
You definitely have the abilities needed to become a pro.
You still have a lot of
Let go of me, All Might.
I can't walk.
I'll become a hero that surpasses even you without you telling me!
Huh?
Uh...
Right...
He's gotten over it.
It's hard being a teacher...
What was that?
The fated battle between men.
It looked like Midoriya was just giving excuses one-sidedly, though.
The fated battle between men!
Kacchan's fuse has been lit.
That doesn't change what I have to do.
I just have to chase after him!
Young Midoriya!
What were you talking about with young Bakugou?
Um, we were, uh...
Hmm...
I'm so curious.
Why don't you tell me in detail?
U-Um... a-actually...
A few days later...
Did you see this?
It says he's a teacher...
Hey.
What do you think will happen...
All heroes have their starting point!
Next time, Yeah, Just Do Your Best, Iida!
A lot of stuff happens and young Midoriya gets swept away in the crowd!
Look forward to it!
Go beeeyond!
Plus Ultra!
Plus Ultra!
