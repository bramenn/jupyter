I am so happy!
We haven't gone to a hot spring
with the whole family in a long time!
What?! Why does a monster have to follow us here, too?!
How dare you ruin our quality time together as a family?!
I'll never, never forgive you!
In the name of Dad, Sailor Moon will punish you!
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute yume no naka nara ieru
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen ima sugu aitai yo
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight denwa mo dekinai midnight
Datte junjou dou shiyou heart wa mangekyou
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare
Nando mo meguriau
Seiza no matataki kazoe uranau koi no yukue
Onaji kuni ni umareta no miracle romance
Shinjite iru no miracle romance
It's such a nice day!
Since you have today and tomorrow off,
you're going to thoroughly study how to be a princess.
Okay, Usagi?
Hey, Usagi?
Wow, talk about unusual. Did she get up already?
There's no one here.
Good morning, Luna!
Actually, the whole family has decided to go to a hot spring!
We'll be back by tomorrow night,
so keep an eye on the house for us!
I'll bring back sweet bean jam buns! Signed Usagi.
Usagi!
The Legendary Lake Monster! Usagi's Family Ties
Sis, you're nuts!
Sneaking out of the house so our pet won't notice!
What the heck are you thinking?!
Well, I've got my reasons for it.
Come on! Right there! Shoot right there!
But it's been so long since we've traveled together!
Even though it's like we're old people,
spending a night at a remote hot spring.
Oh! What are you doing?! Just let me do it!
What are you doing?! Give it back!
Oh, come on! What are you doing?! Give it back!
Oh, no! It's gonna break!
I can't believe you!
What's the matter, panicking like that, Usagi?
I get it. Did you get it from a guy you like or something?
Huh? Well, I guess you could say that.
What?!
Wait, Dad! The wheel! The wheel!
Usagi! Are you dating someone behind my back?!
No! It's not like that!
Dear! Keep your eyes ahead! Ahead!
Oh, so you're not dating!
Of course, not. There's no way you would be.
Wow, it's so beautiful!
It's kind of romantic.
There really isn't anything here.
The truth is, this lake
is where your mom and I met,
and it holds a lot of beautiful memories for us.
Oh, Dear...
Mamoru's music box...
Mamoru...
Usagi, we're gonna get going soon.
Is something wrong, Usagi?
No, it's nothing.
So, is this the lake
where you detected an unusual energy reading?
It is similar to the power of our monsters,
but it is producing a slightly different and very strong energy reading.
Endymion, start investigating right away.
Yes, my lady.
Queen Beryl.
Lately, he has been acting increasingly suspicious.
Could he possibly have begun to notice
that his memories have been erased?
I doubt it.
But Kunzite, just in case,
follow him and keep an eye on his actions.
Understood, my lady.
Endymion is completely under my control.
It would be impossible for him to question his past, but...
Wow! What a great view! What a great view!
A remote hot spring inn isn't so bad after all, is it?
Oh, Shingo. What are you doing?
Hurry up and get in! The water's fine!
But I don't wanna be in a mixed bath.
What are you being so shy about? It's just us family here.
If you don't hurry, you'll catch a cold.
Okay...
Gotcha!
Stop it! Gotcha!
Stop it!
It's mine now!
Shingo! Give that back!
Usagi! Enough is enough!
It's okay, just let them be.
Hey, give it back!
Hey, Shingo!
Wow! What a nice view! The lake's right in front of us!
You let your guard down! What's wrong?
Look, there's somebody by the lake. Over there.
What? Where?
It can't be!
It is Mamoru.
Oh, wait!
Sis!
What's she in such a hurry about?
Mamoru!
It's not him.
The music box is playing again.
Mamoru!
That melody... Why does it throw my heart into confusion?
Mamoru! It's me, Usagi!
Please! Don't pretend you don't know me...
Mamoru? Usagi? I do not know them.
Those names have nothing to do with me.
You can't mean that! Mamoru!
It's me! Don't you recognize me?!
Usagi! It's me! Don't you recognize me?!
Usagi!
Mom...
Mamoru...
Usagi, what's the matter? You disappeared so suddenly.
No, it's nothing.
Oh, the Legendary Lovers.
So, this is what you were looking at.
What? Legendary?
It's an old story that's been passed down through the generations.
A maiden of the Heavens had come down to Earth,
and a youth of the land fell in love with her.
But a girl, who adored that youth,
turned into a monster in a fit of jealousy.
And she attacked the villagers indiscriminately.
The maiden from the Heavens and the youth
sealed the monster in this lake with the power of their love.
And having exhausted their energy,
they rose up to the Heavens together.
That's the legend of their love.
Sealed the monster in this lake...
Come on, let's go back. Or you'll catch cold.
Mom!
You're such a baby.
Say, Usagi?
If you find somebody you love...
What?
If you find somebody you love,
bring him home, and introduce him to your dad and me, okay?
Okay, I will.
Someday, I will.
I'll introduce you to him.
A monster sealed in this lake...
So, that is the origin of the unusual energy.
Endymion...
So, he has already found out the truth
behind the mysterious energy.
O vengeful soul, sealed within this lake,
I command thee to rise once again!
Come forth, ancient spirit!
Give him back!
Give him back!
So, Endymion has awakened the ancient soul
that was sealed within the lake.
What will you do now?
Give him back!
Give him back!
Wait! Where are you going?! Give him back!
Give him back!
Mamoru, we are so close, and yet...
Usagi, is something wrong?
What? Oh, well...
The moon was just so beautiful, I was lost in admiration.
Yeah, it really is a beautiful moon.
Isn't it?
It's so beautiful, it makes you want to cry, doesn't it?
Well, I'm going to take another dip in the hot spring
and gaze at the moon before dinner!
So, excuse me!
I never know what a girl's thinking.
Sometimes, Usagi seems like a total stranger to me.
My...
I won't give in! Even if... Even if Mamoru has forgotten about me...
If I cry, he'd laugh at me.
Give him back!
Huh? Did you say something?
Give him back!
Huh? Give what back? Give him back!
Huh? Give what back?
No way! This is not happening to me!
Usagi, what is that?!
It's a ghost! A beastly monster!
It's a monster! A monster!
Get down!
Give him back! Get down!
Give him back!
Run!
The trees!
It's poison!
That's it! I'm mad! Hey, this is not funny!
How dare you ruin our family trip?!
What the heck are you thinking?!
Usagi, don't move!
Leave this to your dad!
Monster! You leave my family alone!
Dad!
Dad!
Moon...
Dear, are you okay?
Another weird one showed up.
Don't be silly! He's on our side! Probably...
I will not allow you to harm innocent people!
Give him back!
Dear, hang in there.
Ouch. My back... Dear, hang in there.
Ouch. My back...
Tuxedo Mask, I wish I could help you,
but I can't transform here.
Run while you can!
Tuxedo Mask!
Hold it right there!
Sailor Venus!
Sailor Jupiter!
Sailor Mars!
Sailor Mercury!
Here we are!
Wow! The sailor warriors of love and justice!
That's my line, damn it!
Give him back!
Bubble
Spray!
Everyone, now's our chance! The inn is that way!
Okay, stick together!
Everyone, be careful.
Moon Prism Power Makeup!
Here, here! This way!
How dare you frighten innocent tourists,
and ruin Usagi's family's quality time?! It's unforgivable!
In the name of the moon, I will punish you!
Tuxedo Mask, you protected Usagi.
I knew you were a good person.
I love you.
Sailor Moon!
Crescent Beam!
Supreme
Thunder!
We did it!
Crescent Beam didn't work...
All right, then!
Moon Tiara Action!
This time...
No way! That's cheap! This monster's not fair!
No, it's not a monster!
It's an evil phantom born of old, fanatical jealousy!
She is right.
Sailor warriors, I am responsible for awakening this ancient monster.
You girls, back off!
Sorry, but a phantom falls in my domain!
Begone, Evil Spirit
Begone, Evil Spirit

Amazing!
Now, Sailor Moon!
Oops! I almost forgot.
Moon Healing Escalation!
Refresh!
Finally, she's been freed from her ancient jealousy,
and she's rising up to the Heavens.
It's so beautiful!
Tuxedo Mask!
I would say that what you did was unnecessary,
but I will yield this time. Good-bye.
Oh, wait!
Tuxedo Mask...
Endymion. He is a strange man.
Usagi!
Hey!
Usagi! Hey!
Usagi! Usagi!
Usagi!
Usagi, where are you?!
Answer me!
Sis!
Did she get eaten after all?
I should have just lent her my game.
Then lend it to me.
Sis!
Dad! Mom!
Usagi! Dad! Mom!
Usagi!
You made us worry!
Just like the wind, yeah
I'm sorry. Just like the wind, yeah
I'm sorry. Spread out both hands, wow, wow
