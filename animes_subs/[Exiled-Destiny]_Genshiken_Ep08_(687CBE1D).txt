Hooray for spring.
Genshiken
Of course you'd use homing missiles...
However!
W-What a bold assault!
That's f-fast.
Three times faster than usual.
It's n-not that fast.
It's springtime, don't you have anything else to do?
Right, stupid question.
You can't read this pattern!
S-Says who?
We're back!
Ta-da!
Whoa!
Since it's Ral, it's gotta be a Goaf!
Pretty much...
Y-You too finally, Ohno?
Seeing as its fall, it's gotta be an oaf? What?
Genshiken
I woke up and as usual forgot my cell and missed the Express.
My life reflected in the train window.
I'm sure I have something that I won't lose to anyone in Japan...
I can't run fast, though.
I'm not that strongly-built.
Here I go, at my dauntless pace.
Pass away, today's sadness, raining in the sun!
Hesitation, repetition, dreaming all night, all night.
Farewell sadness, to outer space you go!
Look to the sky and shout at the top of your lungs!
At this tempo!
Right now, at this tempo!
Genshiken Right now, at this tempo!
I figured spring was a good time get a move on.
We picked up a bunch of HGUCs.
So now you're dabbling in those!
Wow, there's so many parts.
Dare I assume that rather than a B-3, your choose a B-type...
Uh, um...
S-Sasahara got a JM?
Is that the kind you go for?
I like the inorganicness of the mass production models.
Then why not the Zako?
Well, the Zako sticks out in front too much...
The Cannon too, then?
I'm afraid so.
In a way, that's manly!
Speak Japanese, people!
Kasukabe doesn't have any interest in models...
Oh, you mean plastic models.
Uh, um...
W-Well, one thing I can say for the MG series...
They're cool...
But to be honest, it requires quite a bit of remodeling...
Well, these days they have...
Beginner Upgrade Courses
You went to the trouble to make this thing?
Actually, spring is the best time to build models.
In summer and winter the temperature is fine, but it's hard to control humidity.
Y'know, I don't recall asking that.
You may wonder why fall is no good...
No, I don't wonder why...
Let's go ahead and get started.
Okay!
Wow!
It looks so complicated.
If you're overwhelmed by this, maybe you should steer clear of the PGs.
Tanaka, don't tell me you've mastered those?
Well, generally.
Models...
Aren't they essentially toys?
I can't let that one go.
Sorry, but models and toys are different things.
These you have to assemble yourself.
Ah, then they're less than toys.
That's false.
Because a model is something you have to...
In other words, the meaningfulness is completely different from that of a toy.
Right...
So with this type of kit, the personality of the builder is realistically embod...
H-Hey, did you make that?
Y-Yeah, I did...
Let me see.
Huh?
Huh nothing. Let me see it.
Sure, of course.
Hey, some parts move.
U-um, stabilize the joints when you move it.
Huh?
I mean, that is, move the elbow after the shoulder and such...
Why?
Well, I guess for safety's sake?
If you say so.
Why?
Why'd you put it on such an unstable surface?
Was it on purpose? Well?
N-No!
I thought maybe it'd display better in a high place...
Thank god it's not hurt...
That made me break a sweat.
Some of the parts are flammable.
S-Shall we put them away?
Don't bother.
M-Maybe we said too much...
I sense a culture gap.
Is that the problem here?
You're in for it now!
Sorry about that.
Tanaka really loves his models.
He's being way more otaku than usual today.
He gets long-winded about stuff he likes.
You don't build models, Madarame?
Nah, not too often.
Ahh, so you suck at it.
Well, in a way what Tanaka said is the logic of those who build...
That sounded a little otaku-ish too.
Hey there!
Hey, how'd you do?
I won.
Won what?
A fighting game tournament at the Manga Club.
Of course...
So Tanaka and the others have started building models.
Does that mean you do it too?
Hmm, just one.
It was just an MG Zita...
Then, you don't like them very much.
I do, generally.
Want to see it? The Zita Gungal.
I'll pass.
Beginner Upgrade Courses Step 1: Smooth out the seams
One way or another, let's get through test fitting today.
Yes sir!
We'll do our best!
Carefully, carefully.
Oh, and also, cut those pins off on the short side.
It'll make it easier when you take it apart after test fitting.
Y-Yes sir.
There's no special technique required as of yet.
Fun, isn't it?
It still makes me kind of tense.
Then you'll never make it through inking.
You'll be so tense you'll forget to breathe.
Wow, I wonder if I'll make it.
But the JM looks like it'll be harder to ink.
I thought so. I'm not that good at it.
Whoa!
Whoa?
Nothing, nothing.
Go on, continue.
Yes sir.
Hey, where's Kohsaka?
I haven't heard.
Oh.
I'm not gonna do anything!
I-I'm sorry, I just...
Beginner Upgrade Courses Step 3: Even out the Hike
I finished the head!
Oh, nice pace.
You're quick, Ohno.
Ah, but the JM has more head parts.
Let's see it.
Not bad.
Just attach the mono-eye and it's perfect.
It, it is?
Aren't we all having fun.
Well, um...
The mono-eye... fulfills the duty of being the main camera...
Was that by any chance for my benefit?
No, I'm just talking to myself.
I see.
Scary story, part 2.
What's with these bad vibes?
Am I some kind of nuisance?
I liked how today's Kujiun was bursting with minor characters.
Maybe that's why, but Tokino seemed livelier than usual...
You could say that.
This b-being the second season...
I agree.
Anyone else?
Saki, were you watching it?
Huh?
Uh, that's...
Oh, this?
I was just checking it out.
T-That's still in the test fitting stage!
I mean, it's easy to lose track of the parts.
Fine, fine, I'll give it back.
Sorry about your precious head.
No, I'm sorry.
I wonder if K-Kasukabe wants to make one too...
There's no way.
No chance.
Not a one, no.
But you know, maybe we should ask her.
W-Well...
I don't know.
She's not interested.
Oh...
Making models is so much fun though.
I think maybe I'll take the one-shoulder challenge this summer.
One-shoulder?
Outfits that show off one of your shoulders.
Huh.
Speaking of one-shoulder...
The one with spike armor just on one shoulder...
Is something wrong?
No, what should we do after this?
What would you like to do?
Let's see...
Sorry, I think I'll split.
I'm kinda tired.
Say what?
Ohno, are you doing a manicure?
A new color?
Pardon?
Of course not...
U-Um...
What?
Would you like to build with me?
What?
I mean, you've been here a lot lately...
I thought maybe you were interested in models.
Yeah, right.
Try again.
See? There's no way.
A-Anyway, let's continue smoothing out the seams!
It goes without saying that this one task yields tremendous results.
Yes sir!
Yes sir...
Hey, Genshiken!
What's up?
Don't give me that!
We've got complaints about the smell of paint thinner...
Paint thinner?
Ahhh...
And what does ahhh mean?
Well, it is spring, you get all types showing up.
Huh?
You see that you do whatever it takes to keep those bozos in line.
Why'd this have to happen now?
I'm worried about any dust.
There's no way to get rid of it in the end.
You just have to block the wind with your body as much as possible.
What are you doing?
Well, there were complaints about a paint thinner smell in the club room...
To be honest I resent this...
Yes sir!
Beginner Upgrade Courses Step 4: Inking
Are you tired?
I don't exercise much, so...
Just one more push.
Yes sir, I'll try.
Beginner Upgrade Courses Step 5: Affix Decals
Hmm.
How are they?
Good job...
That just leaves the finishing touch, matte paint.
Yes sir!
This is something where mistakes are irrevocable...
Yes sir!
We'll start with Ohno.
Yes, please.
See?
It's a snap of the wrist like this...
So you don't end up with unevenness.
L-Like this?
Ah, nice, that's the way.
All right then...
The wind's messing me up!
You have to time it right.
Uh, for now dry it off!
Then sandpaper it again!
Y-Yes sir!
First carefully strip it off. Carefully...
Y-Yes sir!
Something's on my JM too!
That Federation peon can wait!
Say what?
Say what? They take this stuff so seriously...
They take this stuff so seriously...
Tanaka, you're a Zuon guy? They take this stuff so seriously...
They take this stuff so seriously...
It came off! They take this stuff so seriously...
My JM!
Hey!
Genshiken!
I don't know what the hell you're doing, but don't pollute the courtyard!
No, we're just...
What's that stink?
Clean it up immediately!
That tension.
Huh?
To be frank, it's a drag.
Huh?
All you do is scream your head off!
And just when have I done that?
You're doing it now!
All I did was give those three the warning they deserve!
Dammit, that's why it's a drag!
What's a drag?
Here it is, springtime, don't you have anything else to do?
That's none of your business!
Hey, Ohno.
What's this about?
I finished the Goaf.
Huh?
Wow, you finished it...
It's not that good though...
Oh well, right? I wouldn't really know...
I'm impressed that you made it to the end!
Yeah, yeah!
Um... can I touch it?
Uh, um, um...
Sure.
Uh, it's okay this time.
If you aren't rough with them, they don't break so easily, right?
Y-Yes, of course...
Carefully, then.
Hmm, it bends easier than I expected!
Y-Yeah...
Wow, so that's how this works.
It moves pretty well!
Huh?
Oh, hold the joint when you move it?
That's right, as smoothly as possible...
Like this?
Huh?
Snap?
S-Sorry! Looks like the leg came off...
I-It's okay! Chances are the polycap just came off...
It's broken...
For real?
It was on purpose! I know it!
No it wasn't, I didn't mean to!
But you said Hnn!
What the hell was that all about? They don't usually break this easily!
Huh?
But... Huh?
Tanaka.
Ohno, I'm sorry...
No, it's all right...
I'm okay, totally...
I'm just fine!
What?
What? Huh? This...
Sorry! I'll make it up to you!
We'll go shopping, okay?
No, you don't need to...
Well, there you have it.
It's unfortunate, but making it up to her won't bring her Goaf back.
That Goaf isn't just a thing that was bought.
Ohno spent a week putting it together herself.
The accumulation of each and every effort involved...
It's not something that can be healed by buying the same kit.
Do you understand?
Ohno's tears are in and of themselves...
I'm sorry, Ohno...
No, I'm really alright now.
Then, I'll do any one thing for you as an apology.
What would you like?
Seriously, anything you say.
Oh, okay...
Please cosplay.
Huh?
B-By the way, how much was that originally?
About 3000 yen.
3000...
That's not much for full-body cosplay.
How about just one part?
One part...
Then maybe that would work.
T-This, huh?
Isn't it a bit much compared to last time?
You think so?
I think the maid effect makes it that much cuter.
Please, meow.
Meow?
I won't let you trick me!
Hey, that's no fair, you promised!
What?
We took no detours or shortcuts...
Only vivid dreams extended deep into the shadows.
We aren't quite grown up.
Simple but complicated glistening like marbles.
The time we could see from there sparkled, even if nothing big happened.
What we see from the marbles in our hands now is a little different...
Kasukabe the cat-eared maid...
I'm sure she'd be uppity at first, but she'd turn obedient before long...
Oh, I like...
Right now, their imaginations are running wild!
When a character gets upset, a huge droplet of water appears.
You mean the sweat drop.
Don't you think it's gotten a little too old?
Just like blinking lines over their heads when they realize something.
Or when they're on a cheek.
Sometimes they're even over b-breasts.
I guess even symbols like those can become fads.
T-The most embarrassing things these days are...
Yeah, I like the kind where you can shout out the...
