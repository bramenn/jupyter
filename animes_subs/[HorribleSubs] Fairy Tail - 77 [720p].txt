Wendy and Carla joined our guild,
and things have gotten lively again!
Gildarts came back, too... I'm all fired up!
There's one thing that I wonder about, though...
There's Mystogan too, right? What is he...
Whoops, time's up!
Let's get a move on!
This isn't it!
Neither is this one!
Or this one!
Salamander and that new brat both have one...
So why am I the only Dragon Slayer without a cat!?
Earthland!
Do you still have any figures of Gajeel left?
Oh, you must be a real hard-core fan...
Yes, we have some, most definitely...
It's even got a stand for the cat, just in case!
Whoa! Totally gnarly!
Well, we designed it with the future in mind, see...
Hey, hey! It's only noon, would you pipe down?
You're one to talk, when you're already drinking at noon...
Seriously, man... God knows what you're doing to your stomach...
Shut it, you!
I'm not bothering anyone, am I?
W-We're sorry...
This is difficult...
What are you reading?
A book of poetry written in ancient Harukan.
Ancient Harukan... Do you mean it's written in some ancient language?
That's right. What about it?
Levy, you're so awesome!
July 7th, 777...
The dragons that taught Natsu-san and me Dragon Slayer magic
both disappeared on the same day.
Now that you mention it,
Natsu might have mentioned that Gajeel's dragon vanished the same day, too.
What does it mean?
Maybe they all went camping?
Lucy-san, you say some strange things sometimes...
All set...
The Fire Dragon Igneel, the Iron Dragon Metalicana, and the Sky Dragon Grandine...
I wonder where they all are now?
Aye!
Carla!
This is a fish I caught!
I was thinking I could give it to you, Carla...
I don't want it.
I hate fish.
I see... Then, what do you like? Next time, I'll...
Be quiet!
Stop hanging around me!
Hey, Carla...
You didn't have to go that far...
Right, Happy?
Carla! Don't you think that was mean?
Happy, yeah, right... What's happy about this?
He doesn't know a damn thing!
Wait, Carla!
Don't you think Carla is oddly cold to Happy?
I wonder why...
Carla!
What? I thought I told you to stop hanging around me.
Did I, maybe, do something wrong to you?
No, that's not it...
You can't protect Natsu.
I will protect Wendy.
No matter what happens, I will protect Wendy, I swear!
I can protect Natsu, too!
Natsu calls me his partner!
No, you can't.
A cat who doesn't even know what he is, like you...
What... I am?
What's with the scratches?
Shut yer trap!
Carla!
Carla!
Where are you?
Carla, I finally found you.
Wendy...
You'll catch a cold without an umbrella like that.
So will you, Carla.
Carla, it hasn't been that long since we joined this guild,
so I think you have to try and get along more with everyone.
There's no need.
As long as you're here, that's enough for me.
Why do you always have to be this way?
Who's that?
Wendy...
That voice...
I never would have thought you would come to this guild.
Jellal!
W-What's the meaning of this? I thought you were captured!
That was a different person than me.
But...
I mean, you're clearly Jellal!
I am Mystogan, a member of Fairy Tail.
Seven years ago...
While I knew hardly anything about this world, I gave my name to you as Jellal...
This world?
You don't mean...
You're the one from seven years ago?
You're the Jellal from back then?
I've missed you so much!
I'm sorry I wasn't able to see you.
But... Now is not the time for happy reunions...
Without delay...
Get away from this city, without delay!
Jellal!
I have failed in my mission...
Anima!
What?
What's wrong?
No! I'm coming with you!
You can't. It'll be dangerous to come with me.
Anima has grown too large for my power alone to suppress it!
Before long, Magnolia will be wiped out...
W-What do you mean?
I don't know what you're saying at all!
It's over. The destruction is already certain...
At the very least, you could...
What about Fairy Tail?
What about everyone in the guild?
This rain just isn't stopping...
You know?
I do not think it is Juvia's fault.
Nobody was blaming you.
How long are you gonna sleep, Natsu?
Let's scribble on his face!
Tell me! What about everyone in the guild?
I'm saying that everyone will die!
Wendy!
I have to warn everyone!
You can't go! You, at least, should leave the city!
By myself? I could never think of it!
Because I'm a member of Fairy Tail now!
Gray, please stop these kinds of childish pranks.
Who're you callin' a child, eh?
Now you're even worse than a kid!
Is there a fight?!
Let me in on it!
What are you muttering about?
A Man! You people need to be more assertive! And you call yourself a Man?
Here.
Who drew this on me?
There's only one other person who'd stoop to your level, right?
Was it you, Gray?
You wanna go, bud?
I punished you for your loud-ass snoring, is what!
You bastard!
Gray-sama... You look so dreamy when you're fighting!
Rainy days are perfect for going on dates with your boyfriend...
Cana, make sure to leave enough of your boyfriend to serve guests, okay?
Oh? Where are you going on a day like this, Mira?
Just to the church...
If you're a Man, then get stronger!
You won't be able to protect Levy like that!
Y-Yeah...
We know.
Elfman, we're leaving!
You tell'em too, Neechan!
They totally screwed up on their last job.
They got knocked out first, and Levy had to finish up the job all by herself!
It hurts to hear about it.
We suck so bad...
I think Jet and Droy were doing their best.
Mira-chan!
Ouch!
Perhaps...
I wonder.
Why are Mira-san and Elfman going to the church on a day like today?
Oh, right.
It's almost the anniversary of Lisanna's death.
Lisanna?
Mira and Elfman's little sister.
It was two years ago... An accident on a job.
When it gets close to the anniversary, those two start start going to the church.
I see...
Now that you mention it, you remind me a bit of Lisanna.
I do?
Like how you get along well with Natsu...
Damn it... That guy's got too much energy...
Asleep already!?
So Natsu used to have a girl, huh?
You're way too sticky.
Can't you eat it without getting it everywhere?
This is the first time Juvia has eaten it.
There they go again...
You eat a caramelized frank like this.
You open your mouth really wide and then...
It ain't so high class food, you know!
Although, it's probably best not to strip.
How can they be so bold?
One day, Bisca and I...
The rain just isn't stopping, is it?
Y-Yeah...
Looks like you two are as friendly as ever.
We are?
Erza-san...
Cherish this time.
So you don't have any regrets...
Hey, Erza! Come over here.
Yes, Master?
It's about that 100-year quest...
I've been looking into it, and...
I was thinking of giving it to someone else.
Any objections?
I think it's appropriate.
Ah, there's nothing to do...
With it raining like this, it's hard to get motivated to go on a job.
I wish something interesting would happen...
Anima is...
Everyone, we have trouble! The sky...
What is this? Everyone!
No way...
The guild has... vanished...
And the entire city, too...
It can't be!
What in the world has happened?
Is anyone there?
Anyone?!
Anyone...?
Huh? Why?
Why am I the only one here?
Even though the city and guild are all gone...
Why am I the only one?
W-What?
Natsu-san!
Oh, Wendy...
Huh? Where are we?
There was someone left other than me...
You don't remember anything?
Well, I was asleep.
This is the guild.
A hole suddenly appeared in the sky and sucked up the guild and the city!
I'm telling the truth! It looks like we're the only ones left.
Wendy, did you bump your head or something? That's nuts...
No!
Maybe it's only Dragon Slayers that are left?
That's right.
Carla!
Thank goodness, you're safe...
I guess so.
You should thank the special magic power you have as a Dragon Slayer.
I'm glad that at least you two are safe.
Carla...
That ain't gonna cut it.
It's like you don't give a crap about the rest...
Wait... They're really gone?!
Yeah...
Hey, everyone!
They're gone. Or, more precisely...
They've been sucked into Anima and wiped out.
Anima?
Anima?!
The hole in the sky from before.
It's the gate to Edolas, the world on the other side.
Edolas?
Hey, you! What the hell have you been saying?
Where is everyone?
Natsu-san!
So, Carla... Do you know anything?
And wait, why are you okay, Carla?
Natsu!
What is this?
The city...!
Happy!
You're safe, I see.
I've come from the other world, Edolas.
And so has that he-cat over there.
What does this mean?
The reason this city disappeared...
Natsu, have you heard there's another world that resembles this one?
It's one of those things, you know... A parasol world.
I think you mean parallel world.
I've heard it's a world that's kind of like ours, but with some differences...
So, what about this something-or-other world?
Next time: Edolas.
I was thinking, maybe in that world I'm a king!
If you're a king, Happy, then I'd be a god!
