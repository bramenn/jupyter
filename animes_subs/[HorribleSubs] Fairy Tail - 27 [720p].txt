Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
We managed to defeat Phantom's Element 4 somehow
which stopped the Magic Giant, but Master Jose has come to attack!
Natsu came running to save the captured Lucy,
and started an all-out battle with the Iron Dragon Slayer, Gajeel!
It'll be all right! I'll yell it out countless times.
I believe your every tomorrow will be shining.
The intersection of all people
Never giving up. And that's why we're not gonna lose!
When it seems like you'll be blown away by the headwinds,
grasp this hand, try to take a chance.
Because you're not alone anymore, got it?
Go forward, more and more!
Don't give up on your awesome dream!
That's right, don't cry!
Move on, my way!
Now, with the light shining down upon you.
Don't even think about something like giving up!
Even if you trade being hurt again for strength.
Your eyes, always looking straight ahead,
can surely see the light!
It's so easy to lure you out, Salamader.
That's'cause you keep playing dirty, Iron Dragon!
Natsu!
Lucy, get back.
Gajeel!
Stay outta this!
Bring it!
Keep us outta this!
Talons of the Fire Dragon!
Lucy, are you okay?
Happy!
What's the matter?
Yeah...
I've never seen Natsu like that.
Aye. Neither have I.
But Natsu is really powerful right now.
The Two Dragon Slayers!
You're sure actin' uppity, trash.
Same to you! You beat Lucy up...
So I'm gonna bend that face of yours and turn it into iron filings.
Sounds like fun. Try me!
What's that dangerous looking thing?
Sword of the Iron Dragon.
There's nothing that won't be cut to sheds when hit with this!
I want to test how well this cuts on you, Salamander!
That ain't nothing!
What's that?
It's Iron Dragon Slayer Magic!
We're caught up in it again!
Can't stop it now like you did before, huh?
I thought you said it ain't nothing!
You actually move pretty well there.
Same to you.
That last time was just the preliminaries, after all.
Let's finish this, Salamander!
Now I'm fired up, you scrap-iron bastard!
Both of them are Dragon Slayers who can transform their bodies to take on characteristics of dragons!
For two human Dragon Slayer wizards to battle...
What's going to happen?
I will destroy you!
His body!
Scales of the Dragon!
Hard Fist of the Iron Dragon!
We're caught up in it a third time!
I've had enough!
That made a nice sound.
Natsu was bruised with just one hit?
Those scales are made of the hardest steel.
No way! That's the air pressure from his kick?
Those steel scales have doubled the strength of his attacks!
These steel scales render all your attacks powerless!
Oh, no! His defense is upped?
Natsu!
It doesn't hurt!
It doesn't hurt, damn it!
Aye.
Shut up already!
That's enough pretending you're okay!
You clanky bastard!
I'll blow you away!
Roar of the...
Roar of the...
He can use a breath attack,too!
That's the 4th time we're caught up in it.
That's our Gajeel...
It looks like the difference in the two dragons is obvious now, Salamander.
Even if your flaming breath can wipe out enemies,
against steal it doesn't even make a scratch.
But my breath of iron blades has torn your body to shreds.
Natsu...
He's... strong!
Not a scratch, you say? Sure you're not a bit groggy?
It cracked!
My flames are not just any fire!
The flames of the Fire Dragon destroy everything!
If you don't get serious, I'll crush you to pieces, Gajeel the Iron Dragon!
Enough feeling each other out!
Sounds good to me!
Feeling each other out?
Neither of them were being serious?
They're monsters!
They're Dragon Slayers!
Incredible... And wait, why did they strip?
Come'ere, Gajeel the Iron Dragon!
There's not enough room in the sky for two dragons!
I'll drop you, Natsu the Salamander!
Natsu...
Hey, wait... What's with the creepy hand movement?
That's what you're worried about?
This doesn't look good.
Our Guild! What are you doing?!
Shoot it down!
What's with those two?
They jumped!
The heck?
Light?
W-Whoa...
He's keeping up with Gajeel like that!
I can't believe it!
Now we're getting caught up in it!
Gajeel's getting beaten down!
No, but look! Salamander's also outta breath!
That's so not fair!
Don't eat by yourself!
Shubab!
He really does eat iron...
Does it taste good?
Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up!
Don't copy me!
What? He's suddenly full of energy!
Dragon Slayers can restore their energy and power up by eating their respective element!
Then Natsu needs to eat fire!
That's right...
Natsu can't eat his own magic flames!
But... What should he do?
I'll tear you to shreds!
Spears of the Iron Dragon!
Demon Poles!
Fire, fire... Did I have a fire Spirit?
Oh yeah... I lost my keys.
The only one I have on hand is the new one, Sagittarius.
I haven't made a contract yet, but...
But this is the only chance we've got!
Stop!!
Cana!
Our guild is being...
I am linked to the path to the world of Celestial Spirits!
Now! O Spirit, answer my call and pass through the Gate!
Gate of the Archer, I open thee!
Sagittarius!
Horse!
I am here! Moshimoshi.
Look, he's here!
And wearing a horse-suit!
I'll explain the details later!
Can you shoot fire?
Horsemeat...
No. For I am an archer, as it were!
Moshimoshi!
R-Right...
Where are you saluting to?
Lucy! It's dangerous, so get back!
A-Aye!
Moshimoshi!
Getting Down on Yourself Time
I'm so useless!
Now now, look on the bright side.
As it were!
Here I go!
Edge of the Fire Dragon!
Don't have any power on an empty stomach?
Then eat some iron!
I knew it... Gajeel is...
I've got no more use for you.
Disappear, trash!
Oh, no!
I don't want that!
I couldn't stand Natsu losing!
Take a look at what's happening to what you're trying to protect!
It's huge! Is this a wizard's guild?
Fairy Tail!
Fairy Tail?
Yes. Do Fairies have tails?
Nobody even knows if they exist in the first place.
That's why it's an eternal mystery.
An eternal adventure.
That's the meaning behind the name.
I don't really get it, but awesome!
What's your problem? I don't like your look.
Oh, picking a fight?
Do it! Do it!
Gray, your clothes!
Oh, you're just a freak!
Who're you callin' a freak, squinty eyes!
I'm talkin' about you, droopy eyes!
Nice and spirited, they are.
That's how it should be.
Enough!
You think I'm gonna quit?
That idiot!
Fools...
Why me, too?
No fighting!
Got it?
R-Right!
S-Strong... S-Scary...
What's your name?
Natsu.
Natsu, huh?
Listen.
Everyone who comes to Fairy Tail are like family.
And this is our house.
A family's house is not a place to fight.
Do you understand?
I am Erza.
Nice to meet you.
Erza's scary...
See?
Natsu, where are you going?
Hey you, isn't that...
I'm gonna go do this job!
You do understand what that request says, right?
Um...
Need something-something exterminated...
Something is something at something, maybe?
The reward is 50,000 jewel!
You didn't read it at all!
Shut up!
You can't even read. All you understood was the reward, idiot.
Mira-nee!
I can read!
Igneel taught me the letters!
I just don't get what's written here!
Natsu!
I remember all the names of food!
Hamburger!
Spaghetti!
Rice-bowls!
Cakes and cookies!
Stew, soup!
And...
Damn it! Well excuse me for only knowing names of food!
But...
He really taught me!
Igneel really taught me the letters...
Creepy
Don't cry, Natsu... So cute...
Hey, you! Hands off!
I'm not crying!
That's enough, you three.
Erza...
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Nor is it Igneel's fault.
In this world there are an endless number of words, after all.
Oh, be quiet.
If you don't know them, then you should learn them, that's all.
Come! I will teach you.
No way!
You're scary! No way!
I'm just going to teach you some vocabulary...
What's scary about that?
No, no!
Natsu, hang in there! Seriously...
Serves him right, the half-wit.
Oh, yeah? Underpants Shogun!
You wanna go, General Snot?
No playing around!
Three days!
Yes?
Think of me as Igneel the 2nd.
I will pound into you all the necessary vocabulary to live as a Fairy Tail wizard in three days!
Until that time I will not allow you to eat, drink, or sleep!
Then, yeah! I'm gonna do this thing!
So, do you like the guild, Natsu?
Yeah, I do! Erza's scary, but other than that, it's all super fun!
And I remember lots and lots of words!
I want to join here!
It's an egg! I found an egg!
When we grow up...
What are you talkin' about all of a sudden?
How pretty...
I wish this instant would last forever...
A cat?!
How cute!
He's like a bluebird of happiness!
Happiness, huh?
Then I'll name him Happy!
Aye!
An S-class? No fair, man!
Don't be jealous.
You'll be able to do S-class's yourself before you know it, Natsu.
And when's that?
Well, I don't know. But when you do, I'll support you.
Until that time, you do your best to protect Fairy Tail, okay?
Lisanna, hurry up!
Bring us back a souvenir!
Natsu!
I'm heading off!
So long...
I'm Lucy. Nice to meet you!
I know I don't seem like it, but I'm actually a wizard myself!
The one I want to get into, see, has like a ton of amazing wizards, and...
It's called Fairy Tail!
Then come with me to our guild!
One cannot progress in the way of magic by being mindful of the watchful eye from above!
Follow the path you believe in!
That's what it means to be a Fairy Tail wizard!
My magical power...
Master!
But, I still want to be in the guild...
I love Fairy Tail!
Natsu...
Enough, Natsu...
If... If they have me, then...
Lucy...
Natsu hasn't given up yet.
Your guild has fallen. You lose!
But, any more of this, and I...
Stay down already, Salamander.
I really hate holding back, you see...
I don't know what might happen to you.
Destroying Jupiter, battling fiercely with the Element 4...
He used up too much magic power!
If only he could eat some flames, Natsu wouldn't lose to anybody!
So they say...
Too bad for you.
I see.
It seems I had a slight misunderstanding, as it were. Moshimoshi.
You inquired whether I could shoot fire, Madame Lucy, and I replied, No.
However what is crucial at this point is not shooting fire, but the fire itself, am I right?
Moshimoshi.
The final blow, Salamander!
Fire!
Flames from causing the machines to explode!
Depending on how one shoots, it is possible to pierce through or shatter, as it were.
Moshimoshi.
What the hell is that horse-ish thing?
Wow! You're like a genius archer, Sagittarius!
Correct, moshimoshi.
But where are you saluting too?
That hit the spot.
Thanks, Lucy!
Don't get all full of yourself just cause you ate some fire!
All right!
Now he's at full power!
This isn't good! No way!
Levy, Jet, Droy, Gramps, Lucy, my friends...
And Fairy Tail...
Roar of the Iron Dragon!
He deflected my breath with just his bare hands?
How much do you gotta hurt others before you people are satisfied?
Impossible!
I couldn't...
To someone like him...
To trash like him...
I'm going to pay you back for everything!
I'll show you that picking a fight with Fairy Tail was a mistake!
To be continued!
Is that really still necessary?!
As it were! Moshimoshi.
Oh yeah... What ever happened to our punishment from going on that S-class quest without permission?
Hey, don't remind people of that!
But we have to prepare ourselves, or...
Why don't we get them to change the rule about not going on S-class quests?
Sure... You go talk to the master about that, Natsu.
Next time: Fairy Law!
Oh, yeah... I'm kinda busy today...
Natsu, are you running away?
Me, run away?! I'm just, um, heading out for a bit...
Just a bit!
