Why can't you just sleep here?
Now
You have a new message.
Where are you?
Mizuhara
You're late
I'm waiting for you

Damn, my heart's about to jump out my mouth.
Why would she suggest sleeping in here?
Don't tell me!
Come to me.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
Jiggle
Th-Thank you!
Did Gran flip her switch? Is she turned on now?

Pant
Huh?
Huh?
Cough
Don't just kick me out of the blue!
What was that for?!
Cough
What was that look on your face?!
It felt like an attack on me by itself!
L-Like I would ever want you!
Don't get full of yourself!
You drank some beer, too!
Maybe not, but your lust couldn't have been more obvious!
Don't get the wrong idea.
I said you could sleep here because I'd feel bad making you sleep in the hallway!
Customers have the right to the service they pay for!
Wha...
You wanna go to court?
If you even think about making a move, I'll see you in Tokyo District Court.
She means it!
Well, I have trained in the art of self-defense,
so try anything weird and it'll be met with a swift response.
Goodnight.
Nashigi-kan
Yeah, I can't sleep at all.
Ba-dump
Like she wasn't already making my heart race enough lately!
Actually, I wonder how she feels about me.
You put your life on the line for her.
If that's not love, then what the hell is?
Hey, Mizuhara.
Why'd you go to such lengths to save me?
I'm just a client, aren't I?
Guess she's asleep.
Given what she said about self-defense,
maybe she's had to face a dangerous situation or two before.
She's so tiny, but she's been out fighting the world and working.
She's a thousand times more mature than me,
stronger,
kinder,
and more righteous.
I wanna get to know her better.
Hey, do we... really have to tell them we broke up?
I mean, I get it.
I'm a total piece of trash, and a problem client.
You gain nothing by sticking with me.
I'm just a total bother.
But something weird's happening to me.
I feel like I can change, like I can grow, when I'm with you.
Like the whole ferry thing... I became a different guy.
I know we're lying to our grandmas.
I do feel really bad that I dragged you into this mess.
And I am prepared to tell them we broke up as soon as tomorrow.
But, you know, if I can...
I want to keep renting you out!
Sure.
You can rent me out for just a little while longer.
M-Mizuhara?
Wait, she was awake?
The whole concept of rental girlfriends exists to help the clients,
many of whom want to become better people.
I get that today was just not a good day to break the news in any way.
But the lying needs to stop as soon as possible,
in a way that doesn't hurt them.
This has to be our top priority.
And the best way to do that would be for you to get a real girlfriend.
So good luck. Your growth has a lot riding on it.
A Few Days Later
So, uh, the two of us...
decided to keep dating for now.
Oh, really? Glad you changed your minds.
That takes a load off my mind!
Yeah, there was no way you'd let someone like her go.
I-I guess.
Did you fall for him all over again after he risked his life for you?
I-I guess?
Why'd we have to tell your friends about it, too?!
I'm so jelly. I want a girlfriend, too!
Start by getting rid of the mohawk, then.
There's no telling when Kibe will tattle to Gran otherwise!
I hate this!
Congrats!
So envious...
Good luck, you two!
Your mind works in complex ways, huh?
This is good news! This is great news!
Don't make it sound like you're trying to convince yourself.
Obnoxious.
Cafe Kanoir
Let's go over the current situation.
Here's your iced coffee!
Thank you!
I did say you could keep renting me out,
but we need to adhere to some ground rules.
I will need to charge you, or I'd set a bad precedent for my other clients.
When I'm your girlfriend, it'll be business as usual.
And you can be honest in your reviews.
Man...
Mizuhara in Girlfriend Mode is the bomb!
Each of her gestures screams refined,
her hair's silky smooth,
and her outfit today looks amazing on her!
Is that girl an idol?
That's her boyfriend?
Really drives home that she's outta my league.
What happened to your phone?
Huh?
Oh, I dropped it when I jumped off the ferry.
But it's no big deal.
It still works.

Thanks for that.
The coffee was great.
What's wrong? You seem down.
It's just... Here I am with you again.
Will a day ever come when I can introduce Gran to a real girlfriend?
Well, it won't be easy, that's for sure.
Knew it.
But you have to stay positive, or you'll never meet the right girl.
Rest assured, I'll help you while I'm your girlfriend.
Mizuhara!
Can I get a discount, then?
Shall we get going?
Hey, you two on an after-classes date?
Oh, Kuri. What are you doing here?
Lucky bastard.
I bet the glares from the other guys hurt like hell.
S-Sure do!
Hello.
But I'm on my way back from a date, too.
I actually got a girlfriend myself.
What? Really?
Mine's not real, though!
Hey, let's go on a double date.
I'll come up with the schedule.
Add Calendar Item
Double Date
Next Saturday! That should be perfect!
Added to Calendar.
Okay, it's all set.
I can't wait!
Hey, Kuri!
Not that I mind, I guess.
See you next Saturday, then.
Man, Kuri got a girlfriend?
It's not like he's a ladies' man. Who would fall for him?
Ow!
Hey, watch where you're go
Owie...
Swoop
Perv!
Wait, no!
Hey!
Wha...
What is with that girl?
Rent - a - Girlfriend
Bring your sportswear tomorrow.
Hup.
Hello?
Yeah.
Really? Thanks, Umi-kun!

Oh, you mean that wall-climbing thing?
Yep. Also known as free climbing.
Hence the sportswear?
Sasa-pai took me once, and I got hooked.
Let's just call it making up for the exercise we're missing.
Anyway, I'm gonna go look for my girlfriend.
O-Okay.
I still can't believe he has a girlfriend.
Look! You can see!
Gulp
Seriously, he's not exactly a ladies' man.
Hump Hump
Yikes
But he beat me to the punch!
A Rental
Hey! We're here now!
Huh?
What?!
This is Sarashina Ruka-chan.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Wha... Wait!
Perv!
A-Aren't you that girl I ran into the other day?
What? Really?
Y-Yes.
That's funny! You've really got it going on, man!
Got what?!
What the heck? She seems completely different!
Damn, look at her fine features!
Long legs, too.
She's a hottie on equal footing with Mizuhara!
No wonder he wanted to go on a double date.
Glare
Glare...
Wh-What?
Nothing.
Goal
Then you grab the goal with both hands.
That's about it.
Wow!
He totally brought us here to show off!
Okay, let's all try it together now.
Go ahead.
Really?
Want to try, Chizuru-san?
Y-Yeah.
Start
First, grab the one that says Start with both hands.
Got it.
Then put a foot over here.
L-Like this?
Yeah! Very nice!
Next up is...
Wh-Whoa there!
Hang on. Am I really allowed to watch this?
I can practically see her ass through those shorts!
The most wholesome form of perversion!
Snicker
Ah!
What a thoroughly calculated date plan!
This damn schemer!
Oh, wow!
Damn, Mizuhara's good!
Th-This is fun!
You've got a real knack for this, Chizuru-san.
That was really fun.
You give it a go next, Kazuya.
O-Okay.
Yay! Whee!
One Hour Later
Ow!
Damn it all! Do I have to be lame at everything?!
Oh, good. I have a partner-in-lame.
Shock
Are you okay, Ruka-chan?
Oh, yeah.
Ruka-chan.
Want to try it together with me?
Thanks for offering.
Goal
Ah, this is a sight for sore eyes!
Who'd have thought you and I would ever take two total hotties on a double date?
How'd you get her to say yes?
I mean, you're like me. You're not hot.
Rude!
And you're broke. Like me.
I'm just wondering how to make a move on a girl who's out of your league.
What, you planning to cheat?
Nah, no way!
You've gotta be a man.
It seems Ruka's hot for my manly side, too.
That just tends to be what attracts a girl to a guy.
Wait, aren't you pretty headstrong yourself?
G-Guess so.
Oh, Ruka-chwan!
Be a man, huh?
The polar opposite of me.
S-Sorry I left you alone.
I got really into it.
It's fine. I'm not gonna complain after dragging you out here.
If you're having fun, it's all good.
What's this? Are you still moping over your failure to get back with your ex?
What? N-No...
Don't let it get to you.
Whatever their goal, the sight of someone going all-out is inspiring.
If anything, I'm more into you!
If you don't want it, that's fine.
I totally do!
Thanks.
Don't get the wrong idea.
This is just part of the deal.
Mizuhara?
But don't work your brain into a twist over it.
I-I know!
Chizuru-san, can you come with me?
Oh, of course.
She's trying to encourage me, huh?
If I don't grow from this, I'll be trash for real.
One more round, Kuri!
I love working out.
How about you? Do you not like it?
Ruka-chan?
You're a rental girlfriend, aren't you?
Huh? What are you talking about?
A girlfriend? Rental?
What the heck? That's so weird.
Okay, one more go...
What's up, Mizuhara?
She knows.
She knows that I'm a rental girlfriend.
What?!
Wh-Wh-What do you mean?!
I don't know! She brought it up out of nowhere just now!
How'd she find out?
No idea. I'm pretty sure I didn't give it away.
So, did you say no?
For what it's worth. I don't know if she believed me, though.
This is bad news!
If Kuri finds out, the whole college will know!
I get it! But it was all too sudden!
She hasn't told her boyfriend... so maybe she's not sure.
But since she knows about rental girlfriends, we have to play our cards right.
Sorry that took so long.
Don't worry about it. I need to hit the restroom, too.
Sure.
We've got a time bomb on our hands!
Ruka-chan.
About your question earlier...
She's going for it!
You seem to be misunderstanding something.
Kazuya-san and I are really dating.
That's my Mizuhara! She's got nerves of steel!
Then kiss.
If you're dating, surely you can kiss for me.
Uh, Ruka-chan?
Shun-kun told me that Kazuya-san jumped into the sea to save you.
You two are a dream couple and so in love, right?
You can't tell me you haven't kissed yet.
She knows! She totally knows!
Mizuhara...
Wait, what's that look in your eyes?!
Mizuhara!
Palpitating
Okay, done.
That was okay, right? We're in public and all.
I didn't get a good look.
I'm pretty sure you didn't do it.
So you can't kiss him? Is that it?
Wait, what are you three talking about?
Kuri!
We've gotta bail!
Oh, yeah, Chizuru, didn't you say you had to visit your grandma?
Really?
Ah, yes.
Sorry about this.
I'll be off, then.
Okay.
That was forced as hell, but it had to be done!
Who knows what she'd say if we spent another second together?!
Well, maybe it's time for us to bounce, too.
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Nothing beats having a girlfriend!
This is what campus life's all about!
Right, Kazuya?
R-Right.
Ruka-chan, let's come back alone next time.
O-Of course.
Man, I absolutely cannot leave these two alone right now!
How'd she find out, anyway?
If anyone screwed up, it'd be me...
If she starts spilling the beans, I'll have to stop her by any means necessary!
Huh? You don't go home this wa
As your BFF, I'll walk you!
Don't bother! Take a hint, man!
Quit complaining!
What's with your headstrong attitude that shows up now and then?
Well...
See you, Ruka-chan.
Yeah, see you.
Huh? That's it?
Kuri's dates are short and sweet, huh?
Goodbye, Kazuya-san.
Oh, yeah.
I can't tell what she's thinking at all!
Well, I need to go somewhere, too.
O-Okay.
I should buy a gift for Ruka-chan on the way home!
If only he knew how much stress I'm in!
Well, I guess anybody'd be on cloud nine with such a cute girlfriend.
It's too early to relax.
She's Kuri's girlfriend!
She could rat us out to him anytime!
Mizuhara did everything she could.
So I have to shut that girl up, no matter what!
Can I take this to mean you're admitting it, Mr. Fake Boyfriend?
Wha?!
You're so childish
Puts men to shame
Already a chief at her young age
Sensei!
I need your help with homework!
Chizuru-san! Kazuya-san!
To prove that you two are dating for real,
you'll have to go even further than kissing!
E-Even further?!
No way! Not happening!
I can't do it!
Oh, but you have to.
Prove your love by bungee jumping! Let's bungee!
On the next episode of Rent-a-Girlfriend!
Provisional Girlfriend...
Hmm... Maybe bungee jumping wasn't it.
