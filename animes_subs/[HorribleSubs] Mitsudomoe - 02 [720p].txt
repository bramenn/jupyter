TL Note: She said the owner of a Assassin Agency or something. Must've been a reference.
It's actually a pun on kami which means both god and Paper.

The triplets are unstoppable
Although it's the start of spring, it is still very cold today.
Is maintaining your image that important to you?
Huh? What's an i-image?
Today sure is w-wa-war-warm!
Are you a special agent or something?!
You're trying too hard!
Geez, your face is all red. I bet you have a fever.
Oh?! You're being rather nice, Mitsuba-chan!
W-What are you saying?! I just don't want to catch anything from her!
Mitsuba-chan! Someone take her to the infirmary!
I don't wanna, she's disgusting.
My nose is all runny.
Today, we will be looking at averages and how to find them.
Let's start with...
My nose won't stop running.
If it doesn't stop soon, I might die of dehydration!
Shocking Truth!
Tragedy. A young girl in Grade 6
Killed by a runny nose!
One million copies sold!
Sis died from runny nose
By Marui Hitoha
My sister died from a runny nose!
So pitiful!
The t-tissues!
Even the tissue gods have given up on me?!
I guess I'll have to use my notes!
I wanna eat boobies with wasabi and soy sauce.
I can't do it! It's a waste of good sketches!
For some reason, these sketches came out really good!
It's all over.
I don't even have any textbooks with me!
Empty!
Finding averages
So if you divide it by the number of people, you can find the average.
Yabe-cchi!
What's wrong, Futaba-chan?
Sensei, you made a mistake on the board.
Yabe-cchi!
Sensei, your mistake!
Yabe-cchi!
Sensei, your mistake!
Yabe-cchi!
Sensei, your mistake!
Yabe-cchi!
Sensei, Yabe-
Geez, one at a time!
Geez...
This is bad! It keeps coming out!
Yabe-cchi, I'll take it all back now!
Stop spinning around and fix your mistake!
Even if you say that...
S-Sorry!
I can't get it off!
The average of the four people is 8.6 seconds.
A-san took 7.8 seconds.
Yabe-cchi is a talented hypnotist.
I can't sleep face down like this!
But I can't beat the afternoon drowsiness!
What the hell? Disgusting!
Sleep while facing forward!
And close your eyes properly!
You stupid, stupid, stupid...
What's with this dirty arm?!
How noisy...
I can't believe it; it's all sticky and wet!
Geez, face forward!
Huh?! If you sleep in a place like that, you'll catch a cold.
S-Someone take her to the infirmary!
I don't wanna, she's disgusting.
Infirmary
I'm really sorry...
My students are always causing trouble for you.
No, it's fine. It's great to be energetic!
Okay, let's sterilize it.
Mit-chan, that lump looks like a huge plum!
That stupid Futaba!
Let's see who gets hit - rock, scissors, paper!
Go away!
How many times are you going to try and kill me in this anime?!
Calm down, Mitsuba-chan.
I'm from Class 4-1.
Okay!
I've brought back the urine samples.
Thanks for your help!
Zoom zoom!
Woah! It's urine from thirty people?
Yeah.
Ah! The urine!
She tripped over nothing!
Is this the legendary klutz?!
O-Oh no!
Kuriyama-sensei, your knee! It's squashing them!
Nooo!
The urine! The urine!
Kuriyama-sensei, are you alrig-
It reeks of urine!
Ah, please be quiet. There's a girl sleeping at the back.
It's all your fault!
And hurry up and stop my bleeding! Are you going to let me die?!
C-Calm down.
Don't touch me after you touched the urine!
I-I'm so sorry!
I'm really ashamed of myself.
Everyone makes mistakes.
I'm not even worth pitying.
Geez.
That stinks! Isn't it urine?!
I mistook it for the disinfectant!
Who would mistake it with urine?! Are you just trying to kill me?!
No I'm not! I'm really sorry!
I'll do it myself! I don't have enough lives for this.
Here, have a drink.
Thanks.
Futaba you idiot!
It's all your fault to begin with!
Don't get too depressed over it.
Maybe I'm not fit for this job after all.
Urine! That's urine, sensei!
I've mistaken it for the milk!
I'm sure you're just too tired.
Maybe that's it.
Like I said! That's urine!
No! I've had enough of this!
That's my line, you idiot!
Sensei, I've brought the urine samples from Class 3-4.
Steady...steady!
Stay calm!
Watch your step!
O-Okay.
I'll clear the way for you!
You can leave all the obstacles to me!
Thank you so much.
Umm Futa...Mitsu...Hito...Mitsuha-chan!
It's Futaba.
Please remember it next time.
Is this where you store the samples?
Gently... Gently put it down.
O-Okay.
I-I did it!
Congratulations!
Good work, Kuriyama-cchi!
They're getting squashed again, Kuriyama-sensei!
T-This is the battle of the United Urine!
Be quiet.
Why did you put them on a sleeping child?!
I didn't know she was there!
This stress is going to kill me.
Saturday Morning
Kuriyama-sensei, I didn't expect you to be this bold.
That tickles, Kuriyama-sensei.
N-No, not there!
There're people watching!
P-Please, just spare my l-life!
Help! Please stop, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Eh?! Hitoha-chan! Sorry, I thought I saw a demon or something!
Good morning to you too.
Wait, why are you here in the first place?
I came to see Nipples.
Oh, that's right. I look after it when there's no one at school.
W-Wait a second! I locked my door right?!
I made a spare key during handicraft class.
You made it yourself?!
T-That's amazing, but you can't just copy someone else's key!
Hitoha-chan, it's alright to come here...
but it'll be nice to make an appointment with me.
Nipples doesn't accept appointments.
No! An appointment with me!
I'm only here to see Nipples.
Don't mind me, read as much porn as you want.
As if I'd read them!
Even though you always ignore me at school.
Only at times like this...
Ignore? I don't ignore you!
That's a lie.
I've always been here every morning on weekends and holidays.
You never notice me.
I'm not lyin-
Every morning?!
That's all there is to my existence, huh...
That's not true!
It's always bothered me; and I've always been looking at you, Hitoha-chan!
Sensei...
I've always been looking at you, Hitoha-chan!
I've always been looking at you, Hitoha-chan!
Here's Nipples.
The stuff you said just now, I wonder what would happen if the police heard it.
I'll be back tomorrow.
Next Morning
She's not here yet?
Well, it is still five in the morning.
Nipples is gone!
D-Did it sneak out at night?!
What should I do? At this rate-
Hitoha-chan's coming!
Where's Nipples...
Where is Nipples?
M-My life is going to be ruined!
Nipples, where are you?!
Nipples...Nipples...Nipples...
Nipples...Nipples...please answer me!
Satoshi
Satoshi
Sensei... I know you're in there.
I-I'm scared!
I'll copy the tape and release it everywhere...
and of course, I'll give Kuriyama-sensei a copy too.
Nipples...Where are you?!
Ah! There it is!
Wait!
At this rate, it'll escape outside!
Hitoha-chan, close the door!
Nipples, I missed you.
Umm... Can the Marui family look after Nipples on weekends and holidays too?
I've already told you, it's too dangerous at our house.
Oops, I nearly stepped on it!
Squishy little animals...squishy little animals!
You're right...
Kamohashi
National Park
Mit-chan, thanks for helping me catch cicadas. You sure are nice today.
It's only because I want to see that innocent face...
distorted by despair as I squash them!
I can't wait for that moment!
Is that high enough for you?
That hurts. Wait! St-
Can you stop it?!
Just you wait... I'm going to show you what despair is!
I caught one!
Look! It's an American crayfish!
Cool! You're good!
I found one!
Futa-Futa-Futaba!
Fu-Futaba!
Where the hell did she go?
I-I need to calm down!
If I keep edging towards the tree...
The cicada from before!
Y-You're in the way! I'm going to squash you if you don't move!
I-It's not like I feel sorry for you or anything!
I just don't want to get my hands all dirty...
That's why I'm hesitating!
W-What the hell is that?
T-That voice is...
These are... a pair of legs?
It's Satou and Chibara from my class!
H-Help m-
Judging from her panties...
She's probably a five-or-six-year-old in kindergarten.
Kindergarten?!
I'm supposed to be the most powerful person in grade 6!
If people found out that I wear the same panties as a five-or-six-year-old...
No!
Everything that I've built up, the respect and honor...
Hey!
What kind of judgement is that...
I don't know who you are; but I'll help you down now.
Ouch!
Satou! Hey! We said we're going to help you!
I'm just some random five-or-six-year-old!
Get away from me!
What's the hell is with her...
That kick definitely wasn't from a five-or-six-year-old!
Hurry up and get away!
Get the hell away from me!
You idiot, just stay there forever then!
Satou, let's go.
That was a waste of energy.
See ya, sis!
Let's play again some other time!
I sure caught a lot!
Even the crows are gone, time to go home!
Zoom zoom!
I caught a lot! I caught a lot!
At this rate, I'm going to be stuck here till night-time!
Should I just fall; or should I squash it?
Oh that's right, cicadas only live for around a week anyway.
Compared to a stupid bug, I'm obviously more important...
I'm home...
Hito, we went crayfishing today!
We sure caught a lot!
I peeled the skin off live frogs and used it as bait!
Y-You demon in sheep's clothing!
You went home without me on purpose didn't you?!
Oh, I forgot...
Die! Go die in a hole!
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!
Mit-chan, you're all dirty, get out of our house.
I'm injured! At least ask if I'm alright!
Geez. Just die, all of you!
Kotei ni yuuhi ga ochite
The sunset reflected on the schoolgrounds.

Let's hold hands and go home.

It would be nice if I could meet you again.

Let's go! Let's sleep!

Just holding hands with you,

makes my heart beat.
Yume no naka demo
Even though it's only a dream,
Yume iro no Koi
it's a lovely dream.
There used to be plenty of empty space around here.
As more and more people moved here, there's not much space to play anymore.
It was where I used to find lots of porn!
Damn it!
That's what you were after?!
Next Episode: There's lots of intruders!
