What a pity to reunite with your old friend, only to have it turn out like this...
But destroying Fairy Tail is nothing more than a step toward our goal.
What we are after is the legendary Black Wizard Zeref.
7 Kin of Purgatory! I await your reports of triumph!
Your opponent will be meh.
A goat?!
What is this guy?
I can sense some disturbing magic...
What is he? A goat, obviously.
Meh name is Caprico, one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory.
7 Kin of Purgatory... That's...
So there's 7 of you higher-ups?
Caprico...
Makarov...
You did well supporting the guild for these 48 years.
However...
That story ends today.
The curtain is falling on Fairy Tail, and you along with it.
Fire Dragon vs. Flame God!
You're wide open!
Is that all the power you need to hunt dragons?
Come at me seriously!
You're a real pest.
And my body's finally gotten warmed up.
The real fight starts now, damn it!
Natsu-san...
Don't worry... No problem.
He hates to lose.
Natsu's attacks aren't working. What is this guy?
He said he was a God Slayer or something...
Are there guys like this all around Earthland?
Oh, yeah. I forgot to give you my name.
I am one of Grimoire Heart's 7 Kin of Purgatory,
Zancrow, the God Slayer.
Natsu, of Fairy Tail.
Dragon Slayer.
Yeah, I know already!
Your reckless rampages are even famous in the Baram Alliance!
Wha?!
Baram Alliance?
What's that?
Aye!
It's the most powerful organization of Dark Guilds!
It's led by three guilds: Grimoire Heart, Oracion Seis, and Tartaros.
Natsu-san and the rest of the Allied Guilds destroyed Oracion Seis, but...
I can't believe that the strongest one in the alliance, Grimoire Heart, would come here...
Destroying Lullaby, getting in the way of Deliora's resurrection,
and even sending the R system and Nirvana to their makers...
Jellal, right? Master Zero, right?
You beat those nobodies and think you're such hot stuff?
Oh, yeah?
You widdle dwagon swayer gots a big head!
God Slayer my ass.
So, you were taught by a god?
If you were to call Master Hades a god, then it is from a god that I received this Lost Magic!
What's that? Sounds like you got it from a human to me.
Well, I was taught by a real dragon!
Dragon Slayer Magic!
Dragons... You mean those things? The fly-y spike-y ones?
So it's like, this thing's cousin?
Igneel is not a gecko!
That's right!
Grandine isn't a gecko, either!
Hey, Wendy...
You two, shut up.
I'll finish this guy off real quick and get to you next.
His eyes say he's not joking!
I won't let you fight Wendy!
Keep your eyes on the ball, buddy!
Everyone, move away from here!
Bring on your finishing move!
With a flaming right hand and a flaming left hand...
If you burn down the west, and burn down the east...
God's Breath!
Dazzling Blaze...
Kagutsuchi...
What incredible force!
And the heat is so intense...
The power of a dragon and a god are colliding...
Natsu-san!
Oh, no!
Natsu was pushed back!
You cats are makin' a damn racket!
Oh, it wasn't just cats?
Looks like a little dragon hunter was in there, too.
You're too damn weak! Seriously!
Wendy, hang in there...
It's incredible he can withstand the power of a dragon Wizard the same as Gajeel, just like that...
Is this the power that Lost magic truly holds?
You bastard...
Roar of the...
Did you know?
It was the gods who gave man intelligence, who gave man fire.
It wasn't people or dragons who gave birth to fire.
It was the gods.
Yeah!
This ain't happening...
My word...
He ate Natsu-san's flames!
Your flames taste good!
Rampaging flames that'll consume everything in their path...
But even if they have the power to kill a dragon, they can't kill a god!
This is the magic of Grimoire Heart!
Bellow of the Flame God!
Natsu...
Natsu!!
Two little dragon hunters have returned to dust.
How has he been doing this?
Our attacks haven't hit even once!
Loke!
Yeah!
And again?
And this strange sense... Like he's from a different world...
What in the world could it be?
Even against all 4 of us...
Whoa.
Give me a break!
I don't got time to play with some goat!
Damn... Missed again.
I don't get it. He's not using any magic to dodge...
And he doesn't seem to be able to predict our attacks like Cobra.
I don't know why, but I've felt it from the start...
This feeling like our attacks won't hit!
It is not your imagination.
In front of meh, you are powerless.
There can be no resistance, no opposition.
There is nothing you can do.
Revere meh. Worship meh.
This... This mysterious sense of pressure...
What is this guy?
Why is it I can't seem to stand against him?
Caprico...
There's no mistake... It must be him!
This is bad... Lucy!
God damn it...
That bastard... Man, it's been a while since I felt fire be hot.
Where am I, anyway?
This smells like...
Gramps!
Whoa...
No way...
Gramps, you okay?
Natsu...?
G-Gramps!
Damn it, you're hurt really bad!
Hold on, I'll take you to Wendy...
Wait, maybe moving you would be dangerous.
And where am I anyway, damn it?!
Natsu...
I can't believe this! Who did this to you?
Listen well...
This is a battle we will surely...
What are you talking about, Gramps?
You ain't thinkin' straight?!
Who gave you those wounds?
T-This ain't nothin'!
Next time, I'm totally gonna win!
Please, Natsu...
Take everyone... and escape!
Don't say that.
What about the S Class exam?
You're Fairy Tail's Master, right Gramps?
Don't say we can't win!
Sometimes... retreat... is the only option.
Got beat by Master Hades?
Isn't that right, Makarov?
Master Hades?
Get away, Natsu...
You're no match for him...
Even if I'm no match...
Fear?! Natsu, is afraid?
Fear...
Natsu, is afraid?
What's wrong, Dragon Slayer?
Your entire body's breaking out in a cold sweat!
Fear is not evil...
It tells you what your weakness is.
This is... fear?
Natsu...
Yes! That's fear!
When faced with absolute power, people have no choice but to stop and cower in fear!
Enough! Please, escape...
That's not it.
It's true this is fear.
But it's a different fear than the one that Gildarts was talking about.
Huh?
This shaking is me being afraid...
Master Hades... You will Nbe defeated by my hands!
I will never forgive you!
Oh, my... It seems I've drawn the short straw.
Short straw?
What's that supposed to mean?
I believe I said something like First it was cats and children, and now women?
I had hoped to fight a bit tougher opponents...
Cats and children? That's...
Perhaps it would be better had I not said anything.
Since you will also be defeated here, by me.
What incredible magic power!
Lisanna, are you okay?
Same to you, Mira-nee!
He's a powerful opponent.
I know that. That's why I'm not gonna hold back!
Take Over!
Animal Soul!
Oh? Take Over?
You can use some interesting magic.
And next...
Penguin!
She can chain her Take Overs instantly?
Since when could Lisanna do such high level techniques?
Don't think so little of me!
I'm a Fairy Tail wizard too, you know!
BLEVE!
We're not done yet!
Lisanna!
Stay back, Mira-nee!
I see. You can fight better than I thought.
Then perhaps I will teach you how far apart your level is from mine.
Spirit and attitude alone do not make for me a worthy opponent.
Battles are fought at the risk of one's life.
Don't you think they should stir one's heart?
What's that supposed to mean?
Our differences in power don't matter!
We... Natsu...
We're all just protecting our home to return to!
That is your belief.
Or faith, perhaps...
But I'm afraid that against me...
Mira-nee!
I'll keep him busy.
Lisanna, you go search for everyone else.
I can't go do that!
What was that just now?
This woman, who I've barely sensed any magic power from... She...
For just a moment I felt an incredible pressure from her.
Let's fight together! If we combine our powers, we're sure to win!
You're the same as you were back then...
So I take it there's no need for me to hold back?
You will pay for underestimating the power of our guild... of our family!
Beat Master Hades?
That's so funny I'm not even laughing.
I told you, that don't hurt!
Black flames?
He can also use fire magic?
There's a difference between the flames of a dragon and the flames of a god!
God's flames do not burn...
They are wrath incarnate, destroying all before them!
God's flames love to devour wizards!
Last Supper of the Flame God!
Once you're trapped between these flames, you're finished.
The only thing that escapes is your ashes!
Natsu!
Well, I'm gonna eat it instead!
Don't even try.
Dragons aren't strong enough to eat the flames of a god!
See what I said?
Giant?
Gramps!
No more...
Just try hurting this boy any more in front of me!
I will crush you down to the bone!
You got enough strength left in ya?
Come on, let go.'Cause if you don't it's your arm that's gonna be gone.
What's this? Y-You're squeezing stronger?
I ain't lettin' go!
Stop it, Gramps!
Why the little...
Please, let go, Gramps!
Don't underestimate the power... of family!!
The dragon hunter, Makarov, or maybe me?
I wonder which one's gonna kick the bucket first?
Natsu's magic power... has vanished!
And the dragon hunter bites the dust first!
N-No way!
How is he eating the flames of a god?
He emptied his magic power completely for a moment...
And he created a new vessel which lets him eat flames he couldn't eat before!
I see... I guess there are some flames that take a little trick to eat.
Trick?
That battle plan is way more than a little trick...
Emptying your magic power while in the middle of your enemy's?
You complete fool!
Are you tryin' to kill yourself?!
I have no plan on dying.
I ain't gonna let anyone die.
We're all going home together.
Home to Fairy Tail.
Join together the flames of a dragon and the flames of a god!
Dazzling Blaze... of the Dragon God!
He did it.
What a guy!
Natsu!
All right!
Heck yeah, I win!
I'm glad you won, but you use magic so recklessly!
Emptying your own magic to suck up your opponent's?
There's no wrong way to use magic, okay?
And anyway, this is me we're talking about. It's my thing.
You would've sounded a lot cooler if you hadn't added that.
Next time: The World of Great Magic.
You shouldn't brag when you just barely won, anyway.
Better than Mr. I Didn't Do a Damn Thing Happy.
S-Say what?!
