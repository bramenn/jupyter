Would you all be interested in a treasure hunt?
What?
I found this while cleaning out the History Club's storeroom the other day.
A map?
It looks pretty old.
After deciphering it, I now believe that the map leads to buried treasure!
Iga
Shi
Nana
Ni
Huh?!
Wait, wait. Why would something like that be at school?
It was hidden inside an old pot that
a former club member got at a temple a long time ago.
Temple? A pot?!
Our club room has all kinds of things, doesn't it?
Like Haniwa terracotta figures, or cursed Daruma dolls.
Or replica swords and helmets.
Right?
This all sounds way too shady.
Huh? Then you don't want to come?
I'm afraid not.
Shouldn't you just go with club members?
I see.
I guess it'll be just you and me, then, Senpai.
I suppose so.
Iga
Shi
Nana
Ni
Hold up! What do you mean just the two of you?
Huh? Well, you know, because I'm in the History Club.
A-And what about the other members?
They said it looked suspicious and didn't want to go.
No Kidding!
Shi
Nana
Ni
Iga
No Kidding!
Actually, I'll go!
Me, too!
Yay! Let's go! Let's go!
Isn't this great, Senpai?
Yeah!
No way are we leaving you two alone!
Kiss Him, Not Me
Brother Invasion!
Jeez!
That guy acts like a saint. You can't let your guard down!
Seriously!
As if nothing would happen if you go alone with the girl you're into, right?!
Hmm...
He seems more gentlemanly than you, Nana.
Huh?! You're one to talk!
Yeah, it definitely applies to you both.
Actually...
There's something I've been curious about for awhile.
Does Mutsumi-senpai actually like Serinuma-senpai?
Shi
Nana
Iga
Huh?
Huh?
Isn't it obvious?
Why else would he try to spend time alone with her?
But, when we all hang out together,
I don't get that feeling from him at all.
Are you stupid? Isn't that what he's been aiming for from the start?
Huh?
You're right. He's been competing with us from the beginning and
Th-Then... me, too?
Luck is a skill, too.
I like all of you.
I know. How about we all go?
Huh?
See?! Like I said!
Wait. That means...
Why exactly is he doing all this?
Wearing a Tracksuit Because it's a Club Activity
It's Mount Fuji!
So this is the cave?
Is this really it?
Yup. That's what's on the map.
To think there's treasure buried near Mount Fuji! It's like a fantasy!
You really are excited, Serinuma-san.
Well, yeah!
Come aboard and bring along all your hopes and dreams!
Together we will find
We'll go ahead and head down.
everything that we're looking for!
You girls wait outside a bit.
Sure!
It's so cold.
It's hard to get a good foothold here.
It's pretty big inside.
Everyone, be careful.
Mutsumi-san!
Ow...
A-Are you okay?
You need to be careful.
Yeah. Sorry.
It's dark and easy to lose your footing here.
It would've been dangerous with just you and Serinuma.
You're right. I'm glad you all decided to come.
Thanks.
Uh, Mutsumi-san.
Yes?
How do you feel about Serinuma-san?
He said it!
Me, Nana, and Shinomiya
all like her and that's why we're here.
You feel the same way, right?
Yeah, I like her.
I see. Of course you do.
See? I told you.
I guess Nishina's intuition isn't all that great, after all.
Igarashi-kun, I like you, too.
You too, Nanashima-kun and Shinomiya-kun! I love you all!
Love For Humanity
N-No!
Th-That's not what I mean!
I'm asking if you like her romantically!
I'm asking whether or not you see her as your special person!
Wait, that's the part that floors you?!
Sorry. I don't really get that kind of thing.
What?!
Like, when your heart pounds when you're near her!
Or you don't want to give her up to anyone else!
Exactly!
Um...
Hey!
You were gone so long, we got worried.
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Seems like there's no problem, so let's keep moving.
Sure.
It's pretty big in here.
So cold...
It's actually pretty scary, huh?
Don't fall now, Shinomiya.
I'm asking whether or not you see her as your special person!
Senpai, is something the matter?
No, it's nothing. Let's go.
Sure.
Special...
Serinuma-san is a dear underclassman, and a sweet girl.
When we're together, it's a whirlwind of fun and excitement.
That's how I feel. But...
Does that make her special?
Senpai? Is there something on my face?
No.
What is it?
Water dripped on me or something.
From above us?
They're all flying!
This is bad! There are too many!
Run!
Crap! I dropped the flashlight!
Is everyone here?
Serinuma, are you okay?
Serinuma, were you scared?
Squeeze
It's okay, I'm here with you!
Thanks for the show.
Shi
Nana
What are you doing there?!
You're the one who took my hand and held me!
Get away from me!
Hey! Where's Serinuma-san?
It's gross!
Mutsumi-senpai's missing, too!
We got separated?
This is bad. We gotta get back fast!
Ni
Shi
Nana
Iga
Wh-Which path did we come from?
Ouch. I took a nasty fall.
G-Guys?
Guys? Are you there?!
Hey!
Silence...
Wait. What do I do?
I need a light.
Senpai?
I'm so happy you're here!
Yeah.
Where's everyone else? I wonder if they ran deeper inside.
All right, let's catch up to them!
I'm sure they're waiting for us up ahead.
Senpai?
S-Sorry, I...
I was locked inside a storehouse in the countryside a long time ago.
It traumatized me, and now I can't move an inch anywhere pitch black.
Not even the moonlight reached inside...
I could hear cries outside, but couldn't tell if they were insects or animals.
The sounds of the rustling trees
and the wind howling sounded almost like a human scream.
I'm amazed you even entered this cave at all!
Sorry for causing so much trouble.
I can move if there's even just a little light, though.
Senpai...
D-Do you feel a little less anxious like this?
Everyone has something they have trouble with.
If there's something I can do to help, I'll gladly do it.
Huh?
Now,
let's get going.
What's going on? My fingers feel hot.
Huh? Do you think that might be Igarashi-kun and the gang?
Hey!
Serinuma-san!
I knew it!
What a relief.
Sorry.
Senpai?
I-I did it without thinking...
My strength...
S-Senpai?
S-Sorry!
W-Were you that scared?
Oh, no.
Hey! You two!
Serinuma-san, are you okay?
I'm fine! Sorry.
Glad to see you're safe.
What was that? I...
Mutsumi-san, we found what you were looking for over there.
Th-The treasure?
Uh, yeah. But...
What's with this thing so desperately trying to assert its position...
A treasure, I guess...
No.
I told you, someone definitely set us up!
Dammit!
They even prepared a map. It's all way too elaborate.
Who would put in all this effort?
Oh, it's open.
Jackpot! The second generation president of the History Club is you! Congratulations. Heisei Year 25 (2013) Founding President
Shi
Ni
Mu
Nana
Ka
Iga
But I'm already the president.
Already President.
What the hell is this?!
This was written three years ago.
So, it was supposed to be opened that year?
Seems that way.
In other words, it was a prank pulled by the stupid club founder!
What the hell's wrong with him?!
Heisei Year 25 (2013) Founding President
Mutsumi Kazuma
Mutsumi?
My older brother.
Wha
Wha
What?!
What?!
That was the worst.
We walked quite a bit
Let's head on home.
And thus ended the journey to find the great treasure...
Or, so we all thought.
I'll be your student teacher here. I hope we get along.
My name is Mutsumi Kazuma. A pleasure to meet you.
That founding president?!
Afterward, there came a great storm.
Kiss Him, Not Me
Nice!
Kiss Him, Not Me
Apparently, he teaches second year Japanese History.
No, more like...
It was quite the shock, right?
I-I'm sorry.
What are you apologizing for?
It just felt right.
Mutsumi-senpai, you didn't hear anything about him being a student teacher?
No. My brother lives on his own, and we haven't really kept in touch.
What? Do you guys not get along?
I-It's not that
Bam!
At all!
Nana
Ka
Iga
Ni
Shi
Where the hell did you come from?!
That scared me.
Nii-san!
Pet Pet
You look well, Asuma.
You too, Nii-san.
I never thought I'd see you here.
I got you, didn't I?
Yup.
I kept quiet about it since I wanted to surprise you!
Looks like it worked!
That's so you.
These brothers have so much body contact!
So satisfying!
And who are all you? Asuma's friends?
Uh, yes.
I see!
They helped me look for that hidden treasure the day before yesterday.
Huh? Hidden treasure? What's that?
Huh?
Snap
Snap!
The one you set up, Sensei.
Huh? I dunno what you're talking about.
C-Come on, Nii-san.
The one you made a map for and hid in the clubroom.
From three years ago!
What?
Oh! You mean that fake map I set up for the current second-years
that I thought would be fun for picking out the next leader
that was completely ignored?!
That's the one!
Nana
Shi
Ni
Iga
That's the one!
Seriously?! So three years passed before someone fell for it?!
And it was you guys?
Awesome!
Th-This bastard!
Nii-san! Everyone went because I asked them to come with me.
Oh. Is that right?
That's right!
I see. Thanks for going out of your way for my little brother.
Nana
Iga
Shi
Ni
Ka
Huh? He kind of seems like a good older brother.
So, which of you is Asuma dating?
Jolt
I-It's not like that.
What? It isn't?
What a waste.
With a group of such pretty boys and girls, I'd want to date all of you!
Wait, all of us?
The majority of us are guys!
What are you talking about?
Gender's not a big deal at all.
I could sleep with every one of you.
Love for humanity.
H-He really is a weirdo!
I'm not into men, but I fell for you, and you're a man.
Am I right?
Shameless!
That's the common route! I totally get it!
Yup. That's the gist of it.
Right!
You really get me, huh?
You little!
Nii-san!
Lunch break is almost over. Are you okay on time?
Oh, you're right. I'd better get back.
Later!
Nii-san's free-spirited as ever.
Too free.
Get a hold of yourself, Nana.
But, he sure seems kind.
He really does seem like your older brother, Mutsumi-senpai.
Is that right?
Yes!
That was unusual.
Asuma lost his cool.
And so...
The student teacher will be observing our class.
I know he's handsome, but please try not to look at him.
Especially you girls.
Come on!
Okay!
Guess that's expected.
And so, Mutsumi-sensei fit into our school without a hitch.
His lessons were interesting and easy to understand.
The girls were first to like him.
And before long, even the boys came to grow fond of him.
In just a matter of days, he became hugely popular!
What a great haul of new releases I got today.
Putting things on hold really is the way to go.
Huh? Serinuma-san?
Sensei, what are you doing here?
I was thinking of catching a movie.
Are you here to shop?
Oh, yes. At Anime Ito.
anim e Ito
Huh? Oh, I see.
So, she's an otaku.
Are you by yourself?
Oh, yes. I'm all done now, so I was thinking of heading home.
Is that right? How about we grab a light lunch, then?
I bet you didn't eat yet.
Huh? But...
I've got time until my movie starts.
It'll be my treat.
Come on, keep me company.
I ended up going with him.
This place is so fancy that I can't relax.
So, you're a member of the history club?
Oh, yes.
I see. How's he doing? Is he doing a good job?
Asuma. He's always been a bit meek.
He's not terribly assertive, either,
so I was a bit worried about whether or not he'd do well.
Um, I think he's doing just fine.
Yeah? He's always so zoned out.
He's super gullible, so I used to pull pranks on him all the time.
He was so cute when he cried.
Pranks?
Oh! L-Like, maybe locking him in a storehouse?
Yeah! I totally did that!
At our grandpa's place in the countryside!
I forgot him there the whole night!
H-How heartless.
Huh?
That traumatized him.
When we went to the cave, he was so panicked that he grabbed on to me.
Huh? Oh, sounds like my brother put you through a lot of trouble.
What? No, that's not what this is about.
It's true that Senpai isn't the assertive type,
but he's helped me out in lots of different ways.
And it's like, he's really strong where it matters, and truly kind.
Looks like he's grown up to be quite a guy
to get so much praise from his cute underclassman!
Asuma!
Nii-san?!
When did you get here?
Just now! I was looking for something,
and decided I'd drop by for dinner, too.
Looking for something?
Today, I was hanging around Shinjuku.
And I met that girl, Serinuma-san?
She was on her own, too, so I had her join me for lunch.
But, really!
She sure is cute.
You're so lucky!
I wish I'd had an underclassman that cute!
I wanted to be adored like that!
Come on, time for dinner!
Been a while since I ate Mom's cooking!
Hello!
I'm here first?
What happened here? How weird.
We just cleaned up, too.
Books should be put back!
Uh, what's this cardboard box for?
Oh, there you are. Hello!
Sensei!
That's dangerous! Need a hand?
No, no, I'm fine.
Do you need something?
Nope. I just had something I wanted to give you.
It's this.
Mirage Saga Local Collaboration
Isn't it from that anime you said you liked yesterday?
Th-That's...
The legendary Mirage Saga Local Collaboration prize!
I've never seen it before!
I-I remembered I had it lying around my house after winning it in an arcade.
Mirage Saga Local Collaboration
You sure are drooling!
Don't tell anyone, okay?
Y-You're giving it to me?!
But, I can't take something this amazing!
This is sold at a really high premium!
Look out!
That was close.
Are you okay?
Yes.
I-I'm sorry. Thank...
you...
We're so close!
I-I-I'm sorry!
You really are cute.
Nii-san!
A-Asuma?
S-Senpai!
What are you thinking?
Do you think it's acceptable for a student teacher to make a move on a student?
Then, once my term is up, I'm free to pursue her, right?
You don't have a reason to stop me then, do you?
I do.
The truth is...
Serinuma-san is my girlfriend.
Sorry for being late!
It's not like you to be late, Shinomiya-kun.
An older lady called out to me on the train.
She said I looked like her grandson and I couldn't get away.
Speaking of, you get candy a lot, don't you?
Well, I much prefer having to talk to ladies like that than girls my own age.
Huh? Do you not know how?
Not at all. When it comes to age, I much prefer someone older.
I get it. You definitely have that look about you.
Everyone's got a type they're not good with!
Next time: Forward! Guard the Castle!
Look forward to it!
Not me!
I can get a feel for anyone when we meet,
and make everything work out.
That's how
