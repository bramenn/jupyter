Lets eat!
Pika-um. Pika.
It all began with an innocent question from Misty.
You know, you havent gotten a badge in a long time, Ash.
You think youll ever get another one?
I guess you could make another gym leader feel sorry for you
and get another badge that way.
Take it easy, Ash. Drink this.
Skill! I win matches with skill!
How much skill does it take to win a match against Team Rocket?
Huh?
Okay! Ill show you some skill. I challenge you to a match right now!
-Pika, pika. -Huh?
-No, I will not change my mind! - Hold it!
-Why should I hold it? -Not you, Pikachu!
Thats a perfect expression!
-Pika? -Hey, cut it out!
Okay, okay. It looks like you want to prove you have skills somehow, right?
Thats exactly what I want to prove!
Well, why dont you just get yourself admitted?
-Admitted? -Take the Pokemon League admissions exam!
-The Pokemon League... -Admissions exam?
-Pika? -Togepi!
To get into the Pokemon League,
a trainer has to travel from one Pokemon gym to another
and collect badges to prove that hes defeated each Gym Master.
However...
Here at the Pokemon League Admissions Center,
we evaluate applicants based on a combined written and practical skills exam.
And all those who pass receive this badge qualifying them for the Pokemon League!
Take this. Its your testing number.
Lucky seven! See, Misty, I have skill and luck!
-A little modesty wouldnt hurt. -Pika.
Oh, no. I wanted number seven.
Uh, age, 17. Profession, diva.
Hmm, that girl looks familiar.
Wow, look at all the different kinds of people showing up for the exam!
Yeah. Nobody Im not better than.
-Oh, Nurse Joy! -Yeah, but which one?
- Just a minute! - Huh?
Youll have to leave your Poke Balls here with me.
Why?
Youre not permitted to use you own Pokemon in the exam.
-What? Hmm, here. - Thank you.
Can I take care of his Pikachu during the exam?
Of course. Good luck, Mr. Ketchum!
Id wish you luck, too but youre just so skilled.
-You got that right. -Pika.
Uh, so you want to become a Pokemon Master, too, huh, Nurse Joy?
Well, it always has been a dream of mine.
-So, uh, where are you from, Nurse Joy? -Im Nurse Joy of the Fuchsia City Joys.
Sister to the Vermilion City Joys.
Aha, youre the most beautiful one yet!
-Thats what you always say, Brock. -Togepi!
I came here for the exam because my work keeps me too busy to travel very much.
This exam is really a great idea.
Yes, its perfect for people whose age or health keeps them from traveling around.
And its also nice for people like me who cant ever seem to get away from work.
I can feel it. Im sure youre going to pass the test!
I hope youre right.
Thatd make a nice human interest shot.
-Hey, save your film for Pokemon! - Huh?
Thats weird. That guy looked really familiar, too.
-Heres the exam form. -Fine. Lets see. Your name is James.
-Urgh. Will you please keep it down! -Huh?
-Is that... -Huh, hey, get lost, old bat!
Huh? Old bat?
What are you, unhand me, you... Please let me go! Come on! Ow!
Youre Jessie? That outfit is atrocious.
-And what are you doing here? -What am I doing here?
Well, truth to tell, I, not unlike many other people,
dream of becoming a Pokemon Master.
Make fun if you must!
No, youre doing just fine on your own.
I want to live my dream, instead of my... my reality.
Hm. I can see why.
Whats your reason for being here?
I simply wanted to add another talent to my very impressive and extensive resume.
As you know Im already an accomplished hostess, florist, costume designer,
wine expert, beautician, style consultant.
-In fact one of the only things Im not- -Is a Pokemon Master!
Meowth!
-What are you doing here? -Looking for you.
The one who suddenly remembered an important engagement.
This seems suspiciously unlike a visit to your sick uncles bedside.
And I thought you had a dental appointment!
Well, I...
-It was just such a beautiful day. -We decided to have a picnic!
-Dont try to fool me! -
Come clean. What are you doing here?
-Mind your own business! -Take this and leave us alone!
- Hurry up! - The exams about to start.
Pika, pika! Pika, Pikachu.
The first test will measure your overall knowledge of Pokemon.
-Ready. Begin! -I cant wait. Thisll be easy!
Lickitungs tongue is twice the length of its body.
-True or false? -Im pretty sure it was longer than that.
Ninetales evolves from Vulpix only by use of the fire stone.
-True or false? -Oh man, thats too easy. True, true!
Hitmonlee is also known as the punching demon.
Lets see. Its either Hitmonlee or Hitmonchan thats the puncher.
Oh, I think its true!
The only attack Magikarp originally knows is splash.
True or false?
Argh, Magikarp!
Just hearing that name makes my blood boil!
- True. -Thats true, too.
Caterpie is the worlds smallest Pokemon.
-True or false? -Yeah, thats true.
Look at her. Shes so good.
Koffing was first discovered in a public bath house.
-True or false? - True, true, true.
All I have to do is guess and Ill get half of them right.
Pika, pika. Pikachu.
Now we will measure your ability to recognize Pokemon.
Please name the Pokemon by identifying its silhouette
or any part of its body as its displayed here.
All right! This is going to be a piece of cake!
Heres the first question. Identify this Pokemon.
This is going to be a breeze for me. Its a Voltorb!
Ah, how simple. Its a Poke Ball, without a doubt.
Obviously, its an Electrode!
And the answer is Jigglypuff, seen from above.
Next question. What Pokemon displays this pattern?
Ive never seen that!
-It must be an Omanytes shell! -Its an Arbok when its all coiled up.
Hmm, hey! Its a Poliwhirl!
The correct answer, Poliwag!
As any Master would know, when Poliwag evolves into Poliwhirl,
the swirl on its stomach reverses direction.
Hey, this is hard.
-And its getting harder by the minute. -Pika.
Question 15. What Pokemon does this tail belong to?
Hmm. Its either Charmander, Charmeleon, or Charizard?
Yeah, its got to be Charmander!
The answer is Ponyta.
No, it cant be!
Argh, cant you ask one question that I know the answer to?
- Huh? - Please, take your seat!
This is a joke! These stupid questions wont make you a Pokemon Master!
For your information, young lady, a Pokemon Master must understand
all aspects of their Pokemon's life
in order to achieve oneness with their Pokemon.
Argh, youre not making any sense at all! Im through with this!
-Get out! -I cant wait to go, huh!
But, Jessie, uh...
-Dear. What a shame. -That girls attitude seems familiar, too.
Meowth, Meowth.
-Hey, lets go! -Unh!
Where am I going?
Youre going with me to help me get my revenge!
Huh?
Here comes the scoreboard!
The ones on the right got the low scores, and the ones on the left got the highest.
Look! Nurse Joy is near the top!
Hey, wheres your picture, Ash?
Uh, it must be where they put the highest scorer.
- Ash! - Huh?
-Uh, down here. Heres your picture. -Huh?
Thats impossible.
-Quit it! -Ah, just a little souvenir, Ash!
Well, Ash, it looks like you didnt have enough luck or skill to pass the test.
Huh? Pokemon isnt about tests. Its about battles!
- -Uh...
Jessies been expelled!
Now Ill have to do my best for her!
Pika, pika! Pika!
All right, Squirtle! Water gun attack!
-Squirtle! -Char!
Squirtle, give it the skull bash now!
Nurse Joy, youre doing great, yeah!
All right, shoot away. I want 8x10 glossies and wallet sizes, too.
Yeah, sure.
-Now, select whichever one you like. - Hmm?
Uh, I dont know which one to pick.
You cant tell us what kind of Pokemon are inside them, huh?
Thats what makes it a test.
All of these Pokemon are trained for battle, so theyll obey your commands.
This test determines whether a trainer can adapt
regardless of what Pokemon comes out.
-With whom do we have to battle? - With me.
-Right! Then Ill take these! -Ill take these.
Come on, James! Beat that ignoramus!
Right, really beat the guy.
This ones for you, Jessie!
Pikachu.
Huh?
-Pika, pika? -Pikachu.
Heh, with this, I cant lose! Thundershock! Thunderbolt!
Ive been destroyed by Pikachus attacks so many times, I know them all by heart!
Thats kind of pathetic when you think about it.
Yeah.
Now, we begin! Go!
-Graveler! -Its a Graveler.
-Pikachu, thunderbolt! -Pika!
Oh, that feels great to say!
I dont get it. How come the thunderbolt attack didnt work?
You shouldve known that electricity doesnt work on rock Pokemon!
-Minus one point! -Well then. How about this?
-Char! -Ivysaur!
With these I can win! Now what do you say?
-Goodbye! -Argh!
Its against the rules to use two Pokemon at once.
I never play by the... Huh?
-Ugh. -Youre expelled. Now get out!
He failed again.
Dont think of it as failing, think of it as not succeeding.
Now well see if Ash can win one!
-Go get them, Ash! -Pika!
Thanks. Just leave it to me!
Hey, Todd, make sure you get lots of great shots!
Dont worry. Just make sure you win!
Im such a loser!
- James. -Huh?
I have a plan that will make us all winners.
Yeah.
-Are you ready, Ash? -Ready!
Poke Ball, go!
Flareon!
Okay, now I need something to beat a Flareon.
First Poke Ball, go!
-Weezing! -Argh, I got a Weezing?
Thats bad!
I got to get this. His face looks just like Weezings!
-Not now! -Its time to start the battle!
Flareon, go. Flamethrower now!
Argh. Oh, I know.
Weezing, give him your smog attack now!
Now, Flareon, the leer!
Come on, Weezing, fight back with smokescreen!
-Hey, not too shabby. -Go, Weezing! Tackle attack!
All right! My first victory!
I guess Ash is a pretty good battler after all!
Even Team Rocket could win if they fought like that!
Hurry, take notes! Take notes!
-Now round two! -Jolteon!
Okay, a Jolteon? Next Poke Ball, go!
-Arbok! -Ugh.
-Ash got the Pokemon Jessie has! -Chu.
Lets see. What are Arboks attacks?
Jolteon! Agility attack!
I remember. Arbok, glare!
Now squeeze it with your wrap attack now!
Ugh, that was no good! I forgot about all of Jolteons spikes!
Quick, Jolteon, use the thunder attack!
-Arbok, no! -Too bad you overloaded Jolteons spikes.
Sizing up your opponent before an attack is a fundamental rule.
Argh! Arbok, return!
Okay, third Poke Ball. Go!
-Meowth! -Heh, Meowth?
-Pika? -This ought to be interesting.
Toge! Toge!
Hey, Meowth, good luck!
-Meowth. -Lets see. Meowths attacks are...
-Use the fury swipes! -Huh?
Poke Ball, go!
-Vaporeon! -A Vaporeon!
-Okay, Meowth! Use the fury swipes! -Meowth!
Vaporeon, use your ice beam now!
Vaporeon!
Ah!
Oh, Meowth.
Looks like another victory for me.
-That was fast. - Look what you did!
How could you treat a fellow Meowth that way!
Ugh, sorry you had to go through that!
Say, now, Id love to catch that talking Meowth there!
Poke Ball, go!
Return those Pokemon immediately!
Were not taking orders from you anymore, Mr. Exam Man!
Now were the ones whore going to test you!
-What? -Prepare yourself for trouble.
I strongly suggest you make that double.
Oh, its Team Rocket!
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the stars above.
Heh, Jessie!
James!
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Meowth! Thats right!
Dont interfere with my test.
Just go home and study harder and you can try again next time.
Unfortunately for you, there wont be a next time!
But now that weve rounded up all these Pokemon, its payback time!
Pikachu, Ivysaur, Charizard, go! Are you ready?
And Im going to teach you a lesson for picking on a Meowth!
-Huh? -Were not going to let you do it!
-Go, Pikachu! -Pika!
-Ivysaur! The vine whip now! -Charizard! Flamethrower now!
Pikachu, thunder now!
Listen up, Ivysaur, Charizard, Pikachu! About face, now!
How did you...
Oh, they obeyed you because youre the one who raised all of them!
Very good, Ash!
Meowth, Weezing, Arbok, stop Team Rocket!
-Stop it, Arbok, that hurts! -
Weezing, please! I cant breathe!
-Okay, Weezing! Explosion now! -Weezing!
Looks like Team Rockets blasting off again!
I am terribly sorry, everyone.
But Team Rockets intrusion has interfered with the entire examination.
We have to start over from the very beginning.
You mean, after all that hard work, we did?
Well, young man, you did a fine job of getting rid of Team Rocket!
What do you say? Do you want to give the test another try?
-Ah, no thanks, sir. I dont think so. -Im sure youll pass this time.
Oh, its not that. I just think Im better off getting badges my own way for now.
-Right, Pikachu? -Pika!
You proved youre a great battler after all.
Thanks, Misty. I guess so.
Well then, if you learned that lesson, Id say the test really was worth taking.
Yeah, thats true, Misty!
Anyway, it sure was awesome to battle with all those different Pokemon!
Many roads lead to the Pokemon League.
Ashs chosen path is to win all eight Gym badges.
Only then can he continue to fulfill his dream of reaching the ultimate goal,
becoming a Pokemon Master!
-Hey, wheres Ash? -They already left.
Theyre on their way to the next Gym.
-Huh? Whats wrong with that Meowth? -It got hurt in the explosion.
-Where am I? -This must be...
Huh? Meowth!
What going on? Wheres Jessie? Wheres James? Huh?
I finally got my talking Meowth!
Uh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Argh!
There seems to be a little mix-up!
Well show those twerps next time!
Next time, Team Rocket triumphs!
Meowth, dont you have anything to say?
Meowth-eowth!
Huh?
Meowth! Meowth! Meowth! Meowth! Meowth! Meowth! Meowth...
