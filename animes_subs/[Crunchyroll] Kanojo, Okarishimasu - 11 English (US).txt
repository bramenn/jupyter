Sakurasawa Sumi, College First-Year Occupation: Rental Girlfriend
JobGear
I'm Sakurasawa Sumi, a first-year in college.
My job: rental girlfriend.
My mornings begin at 4 AM.
I wake up five minutes before my alarm rings,
Drowsy
change out of my pajamas,
brush my teeth,
Relentless
indulge in a session of morning calligraphy,
throw it away,
walk the dog I took with me when I moved out of my family's home,
Oh, morning. Another fine day, eh?
get greeted by the old man I always run into,
take a shower,
and head to college,
where I'm a brainiac who loves Japanese history and hates international comms.
65th percentile Good at humanities
Q: What does rental girlfriend mean to you?
I get bookings about twice a week.
Funny and cute, you'll want to protect her smile
Sometimes I'm personally chosen, and sometimes it's a random assignment.
We watch movies,
And what do you think the manager said to me then?
or have tea.
While I never run into troublesome clients,
He said, That's your job!
I hate myself when I'm in girlfriend mode.
There was no way I could do all that myself!
Okay, I'm off.
Bye-bye.

Sakurasawa Sumi, College First-Year Occupation: Rental Girlfriend
Her favorite anime for little girls
There's someone I look up to.
You want my advice? Sure.
Cafe Kanoir
She's Mizuhara Chizuru-san, age nineteen.
She's currently ranked 1 in the rookies batch.
We're the same age, but she's way nicer, prettier,
and can vocalize her dreams without hesitation.
Ah, your shy side kicked in again?
She's the kind of girl I want to be.
That sucks.
Q: How do you see Sumi-san?
She's a lovely girl!
She's so cute, diligent, and pure of heart,
it's a mystery how she can be so shy.
I believe that what you need is confidence.
I was nervous at first too, and it takes time for people to change.
But I know there are clients out there who'll love you for who you are.
Maybe that knowledge will give you strength.
Now
You have a new message.
Where are you?
Mizuhara
You're late
I'm waiting for you
Mizuhara
When hwill hhyou hhhget hhhhhere hhhhh?
Mizuhara
When hwill hhyou hhhget hhhhhere hhhhh?
If you don't hurry up
Mizuhara
Mizuhara
I'll charge you for an extension

Who does that girl think she is? A romcom heroine?
Numa
And that stupid virgin's pissing hme off, too!
Numa
Not like they'll last more than three months, anyway

This is the place, right?
Tremble
Ack
H-Hey, are you Sumi-chan?
I'm Kazuya.
I mean, since she's here, she must be the right girl... right?
He... llo...
That aside, she's adorable! She's a total cutie pie in both looks and voice!
I had no idea I was going on a date with a girl like this!
She's not talking at all, though.
M-Mizuhara told you about me, right?
Nod
Nod
Introverted doesn't begin to describe her!
It's amazing how I can already tell.
It took me just thirty seconds to see she's a total social giraffe!
Am I supposed to take the lead here?
O-Okay, shall we go?
Hey, uh, you don't have to be nervous with me.
Just think of me as a shadow you're boxing or something.
So, how long have you known Mizuhara?
Do you two hang out and stuff?
Even that didn't work?
Damn, I still don't even really know what she sounds like.
What does a rental girlfriend do for practice, anyway?
I-I know! Smiling!
Do you wanna try smiling practice?
Slap Slap
Slap Slap
She has to pump herself up?
Haaa...
Phew
You suck!
Flap
Flap
U-Uh, sorry! I meant more like... awkward!
A thousand-yard stare?!
But man, she can't talk or smile.
She's just...
not fit to be a rental girlfriend!
I figured you'd be a safe bet since I know who you are and how you do things.
I'll do my best, okay?
She's the Souls of rental girlfriends!!
I'll try to live up to your expectations!
Wow.
Pretty crowded for the afternoon.
Bo...
I figured a light workout would help you relax.
Yeah, she's not a bad girl.
Check out that chick.
She's right up my alley.
Cute!
Lucky guy. I want a girlfriend like her, too.
Well, sure.
If you're just looking, she's totally got it going on.
She's a hottie on equal footing with Mizuhara.
She's not very stacked,
but her legs are long and slender...
If she weren't a rental girlfriend, I would've never gotten to go on a date with her.
Sumi
Kazuya
It's Sumi-san's first frame
You're up first, Sumi-chan.
She's staring a hole into him!
Stuck
You okay, Sumi-chan?
Is this... your first time bowling?
S-Seriously?
Wh-Why are you doing this job, anyway?
Oh, I'm not saying you can't,
but I think even you realize it's not really a great fit.
Charades?
Is she saying she hates how she can't talk?
Oh... she's trying to fix that.
She's trying to change herself, huh?
I want to help her, but how can I?
I'm gonna go get us some drinks. What would you like?
Gotcha! I'll get us some Ocari!
Man, Mizuhara's so nice for not giving up on Sumi-chan!
Her shyness isn't something you can just fix. Gotta take the long-term view here.
You in college?
How cute. She's turning beet red.
They're chatting her up?
Yikes! It might start a fight if I go out there!
Maybe they'll go away if I just wait?
That's one short skirt.
What do they call it, a skort?
What's goin' on inside it?
I figured you'd be a safe bet...
No! I can't look Mizuhara in the eye if I wimp out here!
Hey, Sumi.
Sorry I took so long. There was a line in the restroom.
You guys need something? We were just about to leave.
Let's go, Sumi.
The hell, man? You were just showin' her off?
What a dweeb. Does he realize she's way outta his league?
Beauty and the Least.
You wanna fight, asshole?
Girl, you know you can get mo' satisfaction with me than that wimp!
You goin' there, man?
Um, thank...
She talked?!
Oh, no prob.
Sorry... They badmouthed you.
That's the first thing you say? Save the apologies.
They were actually jealous. Talk about dumb.
If they knew our deal, they'd just laugh.
Don't let it get to you.
I'm used to walking around with a top-class girl on my arm.
Do you wanna stop by downstairs? We still have time.
Well, that's one small step forward.
Rent - a - Girlfriend
Huh...
Wow, they have a bunch of stuff to do.
I know it's just practice, but holding hands still tenses me up!
Let's take a little break, shall we?
What?!
C-Can I really have a bite?
Is she really sure about this?
I know she's trying, but this is trying too hard!
She's even blushing! It's obvious she's pushing herself!
It'd be rude not to play along, huh?
Lick
Wow, it's great!
Lick
Lick
Lick
Lick
Stop right there!
What am I picturing with such an innocent girl?!
God damn, I want a girlfriend so bad!
Well, this is a practice date.
I guess she wants to give everything a shot.

She's surprisingly stubborn...
But yeah, it's clear she's a good girl deep down.
Whoa!
H-Hey...
Gah!
Y-You okay?
Slam
S-Sorry!
Looking at her up close, she really is super pretty!
And right now, she's my girlfriend...
Huh?
Wha...
Looks like I hit my nose. Let me go wash it off.
Grab a seat and wait for me.
If Mizuhara ever found out about this...
Quit getting hot over my girl, you ape!
Sorry, guess I did hit it pretty hard.
But I'm back... now?
Oh, hello, Kazu-kun.
Shock
M-Mami-chan?!
Wh-What brings you here?
I was here with a friend.
I was just on my way out when I spotted you.
O-Oh?
Holy crap! My luck sucks!
I go to college with Kazu-kun.
And uh... you?
O-Oh, this is Sakurasawa Sumi-chan.
I can't tell her she's a rental girlfriend!
But if I call her my girlfriend, she'll think I'm two-timing Mizuhara!
Just a friend? Grew up in the same neighborhood?
Sh-She's just a...
S-Sumi-chan?!
She's trying so hard to play my girlfriend for me!
Thank you, Sumi-chan,
but that's the wrong move right now!
It'd be bad news if she thought you were my girlfriend!
Hey, Sumi!
Stay! Stay, girl!
Your supply is outstripping my demand!
I can't worm my way outta this!
Sorry, Sumi-chan, could you give us a few minutes?
That clearly got her down...
This is a disaster on multiple fronts!
Does Chizuru-san know about this?
Huh? Oh, uh, no...
See? She thinks I'm two-timing!
You're like a different guy now.
You've changed since we broke up.
You immediately moved on to a pretty girl like Chizuru-san,
and now you've got another cute girl.
You're more of a ladies' man than I thought, huh?
I don't know...
Welp. There's nothing I can do but take it on the chin.
Well, I should go. I'm keeping my friend waiting.
O-Okay.
I didn't see a thing, okay?
As your ex, your secret is safe with me.
Mami-chan?
Flump
I thought I was done for!
She really doesn't care about me anymore!
Sob
Guess it's time we wrapped this up.
I had a real scare back there.
But it looks like Mami-chan's gonna keep quiet, so I guess I got away with it.
Thank... you.
Oh, don't mention it.
I think you can take it nice and slow, honestly.
Sure, you don't talk much,
but it was painfully obvious just how hard you tried to make this a fun date.
I don't know about introverts,
but there's no way a girl as nice as you can't be a rental girlfriend.
I know there are clients out there who'll accept you for who you are.
Maybe that knowledge will give you strength.
Later.
Kazuya-kun!
See you!
So cute!
Maybe I should rent her...
No! This is my whole problem!
I already have Mizuhara!
This is the actual problem
Rental girlfriends are scary.
There are way too many cute girls in the world, man.
Hello, Sumi-chan? How was the date?
What? He saved you from punks?
Wow.
Anyway, I guess you're one step closer to your goal now.
Yeah!
Why am I so fixated on that guy?
Hey, you-know-who's here.
Tell'em I'll be there in a bit.
What? Again?
Sis... Please don't tell me you hooked up with someone in college.
Die, jerk!
I'm done with all that love crap.
I just picked whoever was convenient... I didn't care who.
But now he's two-timing? Him, of all people?
And it's not like the girl wouldn't have a long line of suitors, so why him?
Is she really his girlfriend?
Maybe I can find her on social media.
I think her name was Sakurasawa Sumi...
Wait, how does she spell it?
Probably doesn't matter.
Funny and cute, you'll want to protect her smile
A first-year in college, Sumi-san is a growing girlfriend who takes on any challenge with optimism. Though she typically wears an innocent expression, her surprisingly serious and assertive moments will make your heart skip a beat. You'll be able to relax with this brave, hard-working girlfriend smiling by your side.
Rookies Batch
You know what feels the absolute best? It's not sex with the one you love.
It's the fap after sex with the one you love.
Where the heck did that come from?
Either way, sex with the one you love is a prerequisite.
Do Chizuru-san. You have my permission.
I never needed it, but thanks.
Don't you agree, Kuribayashi? He should do her already, right?
Huh? Y-Yeah, just get it over with.
Thanks, Kuri! You're a real bro for not exposing me!
Kibe, what are you doing?
Dating Site for Grays
Nagomi-san
Reading an email from Nagomi-san.
She's an advisor for the site I run.
You two really get along, huh?
It's not that simple. We have a pact.
Yeah, if Kibe finds out about Mizuhara, he'll tell Gran and it'll all be over.
Is that...
Mizuhara?!
Yikes! Kibe can't see her on a date with someone else!
H-Hey, let's hit up the arcade, yeah?
Huh? We're in college, and you still wanna go to an arcade?
C'mon, what's the problem?
Uh, are you panicking?
Who, me?
Nothing again.
I'm such a fool, getting worked up over a measly note.
9PM
Balcony
Ichinose
I haven't heard a peep from Mizuhara since then.
I don't even know if I did a good job on that date.
A wood chip?
Oh, sorry.
Mizuhara!
Couldn't you think of a better way to call me here?
I just got back.
I realized I hadn't thanked you for helping Sumi-chan.
She was over the moon.
Thanks.
H-Hey, all I did was go on a date with her.
So I can have these moments with her...
And there are many more to come!
You called me out just to say that?
Well...
I'm thinking of quitting the rental girlfriend job.
Remember that director Umi-kun was talking to? I landed a role on his play.
It's pretty famous,
and my agency says it'll lead to more roles down the line if I deliver.
I've been at it for a year already.
And if I can make enough money as an actress, I can devote all my time to it.
So I figure it's about time to move on.
What do you think?
I did make you a promise, so I felt I should talk to you about it.
Listen to yourself! I just dragged you into my mess!
I already can't thank you enough for all you've done.
Don't worry.
It's not like I have other roles lined up already,
so it won't be an immediate thing.
I'll be your girlfriend until the time comes.
Anyway, I should go to bed.
I have a morning date booked.
O-Okay.
I knew all along. Or, well, I should've.
She's been working as a rental girlfriend to help fulfill her dream.
She didn't spell it out,
but she'd have no reason to be my girlfriend once she quits the business.
There's no better chance to come clean.
I can't tell her...
I have no right to tell her that she's the one I really want.
This sucks ass!
This sucks ass!
Is Maya-san not here yet?
I'll be wearing a beige coat and a gray skirt. That should help you find me.
Got it.hhhhhhhhhhh hSee you at the station hat 10 AM, then.hhh hhI can't wait.hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Me neither! I'm really looking forward to seeing you!hhhhhhhhhh
Maybe he's nervous. It is his first time.

Did you know, Mizuhara? The next episode is the last!
No way. But there's nothing we can do.
I know it's hard to let go, but...
Want me to ask the fans and bigwigs for more?
I'm really good at that.
No, Mami-san! There's lots of money involved!
And how would you ask for more, anyway?
Isn't that obvious? By doing a favor or two.
Mami-san?!
Whoa, we're outta time! On the next episode of Rent-a-Girlfriend!

Guys, we need your help!
Sumi-chan out of nowhere?!
