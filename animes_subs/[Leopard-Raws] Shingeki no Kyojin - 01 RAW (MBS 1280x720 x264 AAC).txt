Signs
On that day, mankind received a grim reminder.
We lived in fear of the Titans,
and were disgraced to live in these cages we called walls.
Everyone, get ready to fight!
There's only one target!
We will exterminate it and make this mankind's first outside base!
Target approaching!
Split into fives! Remember your training!
We'll distract the target!
All attack teams, prepare to move up!
We'll close in on it from the sides!
Have a taste of mankind's strength!
Huh, Mikasa?
We should head back.
Why are you here?
Were you in a deep sleep and think you're still dreaming?
No, I think I was having a really long dream.
What was I dreaming about?
I can't remember.
Eren, why are you crying?
Huh?
Hear! The walls were created with God's wisdom!
The walls are the work of God!
Not one soul shall dare desecrate the walls!
Don't tell anyone that I was crying.
I won't.
But if you don't know why you were crying,
maybe you should talk to your dad about it?
Are you kidding me?
I can't tell my dad about that!
What were you crying about, Eren?
Hannes.
Is Mikasa mad at you?
What?
Why would I be crying?
You reek of alcohol!
Nothin' wrong with that.
You're drinking again?
Wanna join us?
Uhm... Aren't you on duty?
Yeah, we're watching the gates today.
We've been here all day. Started getting hungry and thirsty.
But it's not a big deal if we happen to drink something with a little alcohol in it.
But if you're drunk, how are you gonna fight?
Huh? When would we have to fight?
Do you really have to ask?
When they break the wall and come in!
Ouch.
Eren, don't say things like that out loud.
If it isn't Dr. Jaeger's son. You've got spirit, kid.
If they do end up breaking the wall, we'll do our jobs.
But you know what?
Not once in the past 100 years have they broken the wall.
Still!
My dad said that it's times like these when we're in the most danger!
Dr. Jaegar said that?
Well, he's right.
He saved our town from a plague before.
We can't thank him enough.
But these Titans are a different story.
I see Titans walking around all the time when I mend the walls.
But, speaking as a soldier, I don't think they can do anything about this 50 meter wall.
S-So... you don't even have the will to fight them?
Nope.
What?!
Why don't you stop calling yourselves the Town Guards and call yourselves the Wall Menders!
Has a nice ring to it.
But Eren, when people see soldiers fighting, they know something bad happened.
Everyone's much happier when we're doing nothing and getting called useless freeloaders.
Yeah, I know. We might not get out, but we'll live as long as we can eat and sleep.
But... We're living like...
Like... livestock.
This kid sure knows how to talk!
Not like you can do anything, right Hannes?
Uh, right.
Hey, Eren!
You're crazy, kid!
Does he... want to join the Recon Corps?
Eren, I don't think you should join the Recon Corps.
What, you think they're stupid too?
I'm not saying they're stupid or anything.
The Recon Corps is back!
The front gate is opening!
Let's go, Mikasa! The heroes have returned!
Damn, I can't see.
Why are there so few of them?
A bunch of them were eaten.
This is what you get for going outside the walls.
Moses! Moses!
My son, Moses... I can't find him.
Where is my son?
It's her, Moses's mother.
Bring it here.
That was the only part of him we could salvage.
But... my son... was useful, right?
He might... not have been a hero,
but he at least died helping mankind fight back, right?!
Of course!
No...
During this mission, we...
No, even after all of our missions,
we still haven't made any progress!
I'm a failure.
I've just gotten soldiers killed left and right!
And we haven't learned anything useful about the Titans!
Well, that was heavy.
Seriously.
So all we've been doing is offering ourselves to them as free lunch?
What was that for, kid?
Hey! What are you doing, Mikasa!
Hey, get back here!
Mikasa! Fine, I get it!
What was that for?
Look at all the wood!
Eren, have you changed your mind about joining the Recon Corps?
Help me pick this up.
There's not much.
We're back.
Wow, Eren.
I'm surprised you gathered this much firewood today.
Y-Yeah...
What was that for?
Your ear was red.
You were lying.
Mikasa helped you, didn't she?
Huh? Dad, are you headed out?
For work?
Yeah, I have to go see someone in the inner walls.
I'll be back in two or three days.
Eren wants to join the Recon Corps.
Mikasa, you traitor!
Eren, what are you thinking?!
Do you know how many people die outside those walls?
I do!
You clearly don't!
Eren.
Why do you want to go outside?
I want to see and understand the world outside.
I don't want to die inside these walls without knowing what's out there!
On top of that, if no one takes on their jobs,
then those who lost their lives will have died in vain!
I see.
My ship's here.
I must get going.
Wait, dear!
Help me convince Eren!
Carla, nothing can suppress a human's curiosity.
Eren.
After I've returned, I'll show you the basement that I've been keeping you away from.
For real?
Have a safe trip!
I won't allow it.
You won't be joining something stupid like the Recon Corps.
Stupid?
People who are content living like livestock are more stupid!
Eren!
Mikasa, he's truly a reckless boy.
When trouble comes, be sure to help each other out.
Okay.
What's wrong, heretic?
Why don't you punch me if you want to prove me wrong?
Why would I do that?
I won't stoop so low.
Say that again!
You're beating me up because you know I'm right and you can't prove me wrong.
Doesn't that mean you've admitted that you're wrong?
Enough with your crappy arguments!
Stop!
It's Eren.
What a moron. He's back again.
Does he want to get his ass handed?
We'll teach you a lesson!
Mi-Mikasa's with him!
Shit! Run!
Hey, they ran away after seeing me!
No, they ran away after seeing Mikasa.
Ow.
Hey, you okay, Armin?
I can stand up by myself.
Oh, sorry.
So, after telling them that mankind needs to go outside eventually,
they beat me, calling me a heretic.
Dammit.
We just want go outside. Why does everyone hate us?
Well, it's been peaceful living inside these walls for the past 100 years.
Titans might be let inside when people leave the walls,
so the King's government banned people from showing interest to the outside world.
We're risking our own lives.
No one has the right to stop us.
You can't do that.
No way.
Mikasa! How dare you tell my parents!
I don't remember agreeing to help you.
So how did it go?
Well, they weren't happy about it.
I figured.
People are crazy for believing that these walls will protect us forever.
Mama!
Even though the walls have been intact for the past 100 years,
there's nothing that can guarantee they won't be broken down today...
Wh-What was that?
Was it an explosion?
Over there!
Something fell?
I'm not sure.
Hey, Armin!
What happened?
What are you looking at?
You're kidding... That wall is 50 meters high!
It's them...
Titans!
H-He... made a hole in the wall...
One's coming!
The Titans are inside!
We need to get
Eren!
My house is over there...
Mom is...
Mikasa!
It's over...
The Titans have invaded this town!
Our house is definitely safe!
Once I make a turn here, our house will be there like always!
Mom!
Mom!
Eren.
Mikasa, grab that side.
We need to move this pillar.
Hurry, Mikasa!
I know!
The Titans are coming in.
Eren, take Mikasa and run.
Hurry!
I want to run too!
Hurry up and get out!
My legs have been crushed by the debris.
I can't run even if I get out.
Do you understand?
I'll carry you and run!
Why can't you just listen to what I say for once?!
Please just listen to me! Just one last time!
Mikasa!
No... No!
At this rate, all three of us will...
Hannes!
Take the kids and run!
Don't take me lightly, Carla.
I'll kill the Titan and save all three of you.
Wait! You can't fight it!
She's right. I can definitely save both of them.
But now is my opportunity... to repay my debt!
Hey, Hannes!
What the hell are you doing?
Thank you.
Mom is still trapped in there!
Eren! Mikasa!
Live on!
Don't go...
Stop!!!
On that day, mankind received a grim reminder.
We lived in fear of the Titans,
and were disgraced to live in these cages we called walls.
Shiganshina has fallen.
Mankind was only permitted to pray, to scream, and to die.
However, Eren swore vengeance on his tiny heart.
To You, 2000 Years From Now
Fall of Shiganshina (pt 1)
Year 845 Shiganshina District
Currently Disclosable Information
Regarding walls (pt 1) Mankind lives within three layers of walls. The most outer layer is Wall Maria. The next layer is Wall Rose. Finally, the layer protecting the center is Wall Sina.
Currently Disclosable Information
Regarding walls (pt 2) The distances between the walls are nearly identical. There's 100km between Maria and Rose, 130km between Rose and Sina, and 250km between Sina and the center.
That Day
Fall of Shiganshina (pt 2)
No one remembers the names of the trampled flowers
Fallen birds await the next wind before they try again
Prayers won't save us
Only the will to fight can change our world
Use your strength to ignore those pigs
who laugh at the will to advance
Our complacence as livestock strengthens this false reality
We're as free as starving wolves!
Channel the humiliation of imprisonment into your fists and fight the oppression
Whether your body is imprisoned or not, you'll slay your prey!
As your body burns with an overflowing urge,
pick up your bow quickly and fire a burning arrow
