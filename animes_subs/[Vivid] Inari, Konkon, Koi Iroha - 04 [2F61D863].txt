Oh, right! He didn't see me before I transformed!
M-Maybe the bathroom?
Hmm, okay.

There you go again!
Isn't it about time you grew out of that stuff?
Okay, so that didn't come out right.
But this isn't some kind of manga, so it can't be true.
Can it?
Inari! Bath's free!
C-Coming!
Touka sure is keepin' a super-close eye on me.
Better go to sleep.
I'll join you!

Wh-What's all this?!
Please let me be the one person you tell the truth to,
Uka!
Oh, what to do?
Lady Uka!
Ah, Inari!
Today's the last day of the semester, ri
I see. So Touka wouldn't leave you alone.
Funny how we both have clingy older brothers givin' us a hard time.
Lady Uka, when we were at the Celestial Plains the other day,
Great Amaterasu and I were discussing how we might retrieve your power from Miss Inari.
But even she didn't have the slightest clue.
If I give you your power back, my brother will leave me alone.
But then I won't be able to see you, Kon, or the others anymore.
Say, Inari...
Tomorrow's the eve of the festival.
Oh, right! I'll be there for sure.
With Tanbabashi, perhaps?
N-No, of course not!
He comes every year with his family. You'll definitely see him there.
I will?
I'll tell Touka nothing's going on so that you can live a normal life again.
That's what I want for you, after all.
Lady Uka...
Okay!
It's going to loosen up a bit as you move,
so I'll tie it a little tighter to begin with.
Now, hold this.
All set!
You don't think this color's a little childish?
I told you, it's fine. It looks good on you.
Enjoying yourself, Lady Uka?
I can't wait!
Hey, Mom!
Do I look weird with this hairpin?
I think it might be too gaudy.
Oh, nice! Here, let me help you with that.
Really? It's not too much?
It's super cute!
Ow, ow, ow!
Inari! Time to go!
Oh, right.
New sandals?
You've grown out of last year's.
Thanks, Mom!
Do they chafe at all?
You might want to wear some thin socks.
Nope, I'm good. See you!
Sumizome!
Wow! That yukata's the cutest!
So is yours!
And I love that sash!
It's so you!
You really think so?
I picked it up on sale last summer, and...
Huh?
That hairpin...
Doesn't it look just like Anze's?
Like on the cover of the manga I lent you,
Midnight Thrills volume twelve!
Oh, right! That was such a cute picture!
Do I really look like her?
Yeah, totally! Have you read it?
Uh-huh!
Just remembering that one scene,
where Anze is under attack by the demon envoy,
Bring it!
Is that all?
Ba-dump
and Manabe comes to save her...
I know! She's so scared of men, but then something like love stirs within her...
Couldn't you just cry?!
Miss Inari? Miss Inari!
Oh, yeah. Keiko and Maru said they'd be waitin' out front.
Then let's get going!
Yeah!
It's pretty crowded. Let's go'round that way.
Sure!
So, whose team are you on, Sumizome?
Hmm... I guess I'm rooting for Manabe.
I thought so!
What's wrong?
I get the feeling we're being followed.
By who?
I don't know. It just feels like someone's behind
Hey, you two! Get down!
Splendid!
You okay, Inari?
And... Oh, Sumizome.
What was that all about?
Miss Inari, that's, uh... Master Toshi.
Huh?
Master Toshi, are you still alive?
What an unparalleled pleasure, being punted by a girl...
I'll hand him over to the police.
Keiko, you take over from here.
You all right?
Oh, uh, thank y
Huh?
Well, as long as you're okay.

Um, Manabe
I mean, Sanjo, what's your favorite festival food?
Skewers, maybe? The pork belly ones.
Oh, so you like skewers, huh, ManabeI mean, Sanjo?
You sure are slippin' up a lot tonight, Sumizome.
No way... right?
Shooting Gallery
Shooting Gallery
Hey, a shootin' gallery!
I'm in!
You sure are into all this guy stuff.
Is something the matter, Fushimi?
Nope! Nothing at all.
Let's hope Tanbabashi comes.
Yeah... Huh?
I knew it! I knew you were into him!
Yeah...
But how could you tell?
While I was reading that manga you lent me,
I noticed that Anze's face when she's talking with Manabe
looks just like yours when you're talking with Tanbabashi.
Whoa, a little shoujo manga's a dangerous thing!
No wonder they call it Romance 101!
Yeowch!
Hey! Whaddaya think you're doin'?!

Huh? What's so...
M-My hair! Does it look weird?
And my face! Well, there's no fixin' that...
You're fine.
In fact, Fushimi, you're adorable!
See ya!
Now all we can do is pray.
Which one are you gunnin' for?
That watch.
The batteries in mine just went kaput.
That one's so cute!
Here goes!
Congratulations. You've won yourself a bunny!
Hey, good for you!
What good's a bunny?
Actually, uh
Eh, whatever.
Inari'll probably like it.
Huh? Fushimi!
Oh, hi! Fancy meetin' you here!
Are you here on your own?
Y-Yep!
Well, somethin' like that, anyway...
Kouji, I'm taking Shirou to the Bon dance, okay?
Then I'll come, too.
No, no. You stay with Fushimi.
Got it?
Uh-huh.
Mother dear!
Well, then... Shall we?
O-Okay!
You wanna get something to eat?
Huh? Well, uh...
Takoyaki... A hot dog?
No. I don't wanna get my mouth too messy.
Sh-Shaved ice!
Shaved ice it is, then.
You know, Fushimi, you look real cute in that yukata.

Ah, there's the shaved ice stand.
Pardon me.
Whew, that startledHuh?
Tanbabashi?
Tanbabashi?
Tanbabashi!
This sucks...
Just when we were finally alone together...
Ta
Thank goodness!
Don't worry!
Wow...
My heart's beatin' so fast,
it feels like it's about to burst.
What about him?
The sucked-in stomach, the awkward sandals
everything I've endured for the sake of fashion
has been to make his heart race, too.
I guess it'd be just plain selfish to want anything more right now.
I can feel Inari's joy.
It's like nothing I've ever experienced before.
This yearning for someone from the bottom of one's heart...
Tonight we celebrate!
You've had too much to drink, Lady Uka.
And what's wrong with that, huh?
To tell the truth, I'm a little envious.
I see now.
Inari was right. He is just like my brother.
You rang?
Who's a snookums?
Huh?
What is it?
I just heard this familiar-soundin' scream...
Seriously? I didn't hear a thing.
Must've been your imagination.
Yep! Just my imagination!
Officer!
Oh, Uka! You've finally let me touch you again!
How'd he get in here?
Didn't I set up that barrier?
Oh, Uka!
You've finally chosen to dispel that barrier and embrace me!
I-It couldn't be...
Never fear. It only hurts the first time.
Could I be... running out of divine power?!
You've been manhandling Inari just like this, haven't you?!
Don't lump me together with him!
Wh-What...
What's this feeling in the air?
Maybe... we look like a couple too.
You all right, Fushimi?
Uh-huh. Sorry... Ow!
Sandals rubbin' you sore, huh?
Oh, I'll be fine.
I'm tougher than I look! So, uh...
Huh?!
I'll give you a lift.
Can't have you makin' it worse.
You're a girl, after all.
The shrine...
The festival...
I'm glad there's all this red around.
Hold on tight, now!
I'm blushin' like crazy,
but this way Tanbabashi won't notice.
What do you wanna do next?
Hit up another food stall, maybe?
Or we could buy some drinks and take a breather.
It's just like back then.
Say, Tanbabashi.
Have you gotten a bit taller?
Huh?
It just seems like you have, compared to last year.
Your shoulders are wider, too.
Yeah, I've been havin' growin' pains lately.
I ache all over.
Didn't think you'd notice, since you see me every day. You've got a sharp eye!
Oh, totally!
I mean, I have been watchin' you all this time!
Huh?
I-I mean, uh, that is...
I-I've taken up people watchin' as a hobby!
People watching?
Yep! I'm so clueless and clumsy that I figured I could improve myself by watchin' people!
Phew, dodged that bullet.
But I know I can't put off tellin' him forever.
Eh, it's all right.
This fire's barely kindled,
and I'm happy enough with things the way they are right now.
Uka!
I'm totally into bondage, just so you know!
H-Hey, are you sure about this?
Hush! And don't make eye contact!
Hey. Hey, listen!
Did... You didn't give any, you know...
You didn't give any divine power to Inari... did you?
You bastard! Get your filthy hands off my Uka!
Can't you tell she doesn't like that, you pervert?!
Uka, you poor thing!
Look who's talking!
L-Lady Uka!
Well? Answer me!
I-It's nothing, really.
I wanted to make friends with a humanwith Inari
so I made it so she could see us gods. That's all.
And I should believe that, right?
You're not lyin' to me, right?
Sorry for all the meddlin'.
Forgive me, Touka.
Wh-What are you apologizing for?
You need not worry yourself on account of that rabble!
Touka is my friend!
It's only natural to feel guilty about lying to a friend!
Do humans even deserve to become friendly with the gods?
We gods must treat all humans even-handedly.
Th-That much I know! I
Then I'm sure you're also aware that even as humans confide in the gods,
their brief lifespans flash past us in the blink of an eye.
Honestly, I don't think it's such a good idea for you to get so close to
It's fine!
I've chosen the proper path. I'm sure of it!
I just...
I just want to catch a glimpse of their happiness, even if only for a moment.
And then...
If I'd never met Lady Uka,
none of this would ever have happened.
Now it's my turn to help her find happiness, too.
