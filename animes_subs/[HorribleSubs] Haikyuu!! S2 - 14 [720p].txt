Akiteru, how long are you able to stay?
I have to go back to work on the 14th,
so I'm heading back to Sendai the day after tomorrow.
You didn't want to go to Kei's game?
When I mentioned that I was thinking about going yesterday,
he looked really annoyed...
Oh, yeah.
Mom, about Kei's glasses...
I'm home.
How was the game?
Oh. Well, we won.
What were your opponents like?
Two meters.
Huh?
They had a first-year that was 201 cm tall.
Two hundred... And you won?
Apparently, he'd just started playing volleyball.
Seriously?
Our blocks were absolutely useless, though.
Ah...
What?
You think it's only obvious if you lose, don't you?
Huh? Yeah.
I mean, he was two meters tall.
Why don't you come over and join my team's practice?
Haikyu!!
Episode 14: Still Growing
All right, start your individual practice now.
We now have less than two months until the qualifier
at the end of October.
Work hard on improving individually.
Yeah!
K-Kageyama-kun, what are you doing?
You could tell it was me?
Yeah...
Damn it!
Was that supposed to be a disguise?
Um, uh...
There's a team that we might face during the qualifier for the prefecture,
and I wanted to check them out before that.
I see. So you were going to shoot a video of them?
No. There's an unwritten rule that you can only record official matches.
So nothing is actually going to happen by me watching,
but summer vacation's over
and there's less than two months until the prefectural qualifier.
I felt like I should definitely check them out.
Um...
If you don't want to stand out at a school after school hours,
I think it's best to just wear plain training gear.
Bus Stop
And like...
That's too funny.
I'm a student here...
I'm a student here...
I'm a student here...
Setter Soul
Natural... Be natural.
All right. We're about to start.
Setter Soul
We're gonna be switching out members next.
Right!
Nice serve!
Hey, can you stop Ushiwaka, Tsukishima?
Of course not.
Even if it was pure luck, he's the ace of a team in the national Top Three.
Well, if someone doesn't stop Ushiwaka, we won't be able
to beat Shiratorizawa.
We're middle blockers.
You're already thinking about taking top in the prefecture?
You're sure taking this lightly.
Anyway,
we have to beat everyone, so it's the same thing.
You piss me off.
Why?!
If you can't do it,
I'm gonna do it!
Thinking that you can't do it yourself is one thing,
but having someone else tell you that you can't is irritating.
Huh?
Especially when it comes from you.
You pushed the diarrhea pressure point! Curse you, Tsukishima!
I'm leaving.
Hey, this is Kei.
I'm heading over today.
Ow!
Sorry!
You made it back alive, Kageyama.
How'd it go?
I may never be able to defeat Oikawa-san.
What are you talking about?
Quit messing around!
What did you see?
I think Seijoh was having a match against a college that had some of their alumni.
When I got there, they were on break,
and they were about to start a new match with different members.
I'm Oikawa. Pleasure working with you all.
Oikawa-san went onto the college team as their setter.
It looked like there were a lot of people he had just met.
That's Seijoh's captain, right?
He's pretty gaudy.
But...
After just a few plays,
Oikawa-san was a part of the team.
Even I could tell how lively the spikers felt.
The ability to draw 100 out of anyone...
Most people can't do that, even after spending lots of time with them.
But with Oikawa-san, it didn't matter if he disliked the player,
or if the player had certain habits.
I'm sure
that he could use them freely.
No matter where he is,
Oikawa is a setter that can bring the absolute best out of his team.
So are you saying that you're freaked out
by the Great King again, Kageyama-kun?
Yeah, I'm really freaked out.
Right now, Seijoh is what it is
because it's had Oikawa-san for the last three years,
and our only chance to fight them again is at the Spring Tournament.
We're going to beat them, as a team.
I'm going to defeat you, Great King!
That's my line!
Achoo!
I just got a chill...
If you catch a cold, I'm going to punch you.
That's going way too far!
Two blockers!
All right!
Adults definitely have much more power...
What the hell?
You're such a twig!
You eating properly?
Can I go home now?
Now, now, Akaizawa-san. Just watch.
My little brother will show you a thing or two.
Like I'd lose to this puny little high schooler.
Kaji Wild Dogs
He loves riling people up.
Forgive him.
Hey, can you stop Ushiwaka, Tsukishima?
You think it's only obvious if you lose, don't you?
Maybe that's because you suck.
Tch.
Um...
Is there a way to stop an opponent's spike
when they are taller or stronger than you?
Aoba Johsai Private High School
Hey!
Now that you've finally decided to show up, you should at least announce yourself!
Now, now, now.
Calm down, Yahaba.
Oikawa-san...
It's been a while. I've been waiting for you.
Haikyu!!
Haikyu!!
Wait, who's this Mad Dog?
A second-year named Kyotani Kentaro.
Oikawa-san just decided to call him Mad Dog.
He was pretty famous in junior high, remember?
Oh, yeah. I remember.
Minamisan Junior High was strong just that year.
Izumitate Minamisan Jr. High
He was never a team player,
but his abilities were superb for our grade.
As soon as he joined the club,
he had a chance to be in a practice match...
But he suddenly butted heads with the third-years.
What he said may have been accurate, but the way he said it...
The toss is too far from the net and hard to hit!
You could have totally followed up on that! You suck!
His attitude toward the third-years didn't change,
and he eventually stopped showing up.
What the hell?
There are still third-years around?
I thought all of you would have retired
after losing in the Inter-High prelims.
You're as funny as always, Mad Dog-chan.
I wish you'd stop calling me that.
Ah, I'm so happy I got to play
on the team while Oikawa-san was still here.
I'll make you feel that way.
His natural instincts are making him cautious around Oikawa-san?
Metropolitan Nekoma High School
So, with the prefectural qualifier in October,
we'll only be able to go Kanto two more times, including this trip.
Let's make the best of this chance.
Right!
Hey, Tsukki!
Jump block for me! Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
Hey!
This chapter is titles, Boku Gets Rejected by a Student From Another School.
Yes. Thanks for working with me.
What?!
Why are you so surprised when you're the one who asked him?
Is there a way to stop an opponent's spike
when they are taller or stronger than you?
What do you think is most important when blocking?
Height?
It's timing.
To put it simply, if their hands are above the net,
even a grade-schooler could stop one of Tanaka's spikes.
What?!
Provided their timing is perfect.
Of course, how you have your hands out,
and reading the course of the ball is important, too.
But even if I can explain this verbally,
I'm not good enough to actually show you.
Someone nearby with good individual skills
who is a good example when it comes to blocking
would probably be Kuroo from Nekoma.
Lev!
Timing...
Having the top of the block up
right when your opponent is about to hit their spike.
I-I'm going to make it through next time!
Hey, Tsukki.
How long are you just gonna watch?
Sorry.
Pardon the intrusion.
Shinzen Karasuno
It appears that the quick's success rate is still about 70.
All right!
Nothing's going to fix that except more practice.
Lev! I told you not to block with your arms spread out!
They got through your block!
Your arms need to be together enough so the ball won't go through!
Right.

Front! Front!
Sorry!
Got it!
Center!
Hinata!
Out!
Karasuno Nekoma
Damn it! Sorry about that!
At long last, we can't let our guard down around them.
Yeah.
The nights are cold, even in Tokyo.
That's because you didn't put on a jacket after sweating.
I can't wait for the match!
Yeah...
I've been thinking lately...
What?
You're entertaining, Shoyo,
so I'd like to play a game with you that's not a practice game.
Huh?
A game where it's immediately game over if you lose.
Let's do it.
A match where there is no rematch.
This is our last chance for the Battle at the Garbage Dump.
Let's see each other at the Tokyo Gymnasium.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, Tsukki.
You better make sure you beat Ushiwaka.
Why is that?
Because I've had complete victory over you,
so if you have complete victory over Ushiwaka,
that means I'll have complete-complete victory over Ushiwaka.
Complete-Complete Victory!!
I'm sorry. I'm not entirely sure what you mean.
Karasuno Volleyball Club
Then I'll be the best! Hey, hey, hey!
You make it sound so easy...
Qualifier Matches
Left!
Akaizawa-san!
The receive was off, so the attack can only go left.
The toss is a bit far from the net.
Akaizawa-san is going for the course that he's best at, a cross.
Right as your opponent is about to hit the ball,
you complete the block.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hey! Wrap it up already!
You're really gonna feel this tomorrow.
What? Already?
But I don't feel like I've hit enough.
For crying out loud...
That feeling, that you haven't hit enough...
Why don't you save that for tomorrow?
I see!
Right!
Kageyama! Let's race to see who can pick up the most balls!
Bring it on!
Good job, Yachi-san.
All right, let's take down the net.
Right!
Qualifier Matches
We're here!
Back at the Sendai Municipal Gymnasium again!
We're gonna get our revenge!
Don't you dare false start, you dumbass!
It's like Hinata and Kageyama live on spinal reflex alone.
They're like insects.
Johzenji High School
Huh?
That means...
Glasses-chan! Be sure to tell me your number today!
She's so cute when she gets shy.
Hey!
Stop it!
Ugh... I'm so sorry about that!
Hey, they stopped.
They're stopped in mid-air. That's awesome.
Well, see you in the first match.
So they're...
Johzenji Karasuno
The team that was at the Inter-High semifinal.
This goes without saying, but...
They're all here.
Right here.
We're gonna beat them all!
They're so hyper.
That just calms us down even more.
I'm well aware...
That the bathroom is where you run into dangerous people.
Carefully... Carefully...
Whatcha doin'?
Th-The Great King and Seijoh's ace!
I heard you defeated the 2 meter guy. Well done.
Yes! No!
Which is it?
This little shrimp is a handful during matches,
so why don't we go bury him somewhere now?
P-Pardon me!
Hey!
Ow!
Hinata Shoyo...
And Oikawa and Iwaizumi.
What's with this timing?
Hell if I know.
So this will be your last tournament in high school.
I wish you well.
You seriously piss me off.
We're going to nationals, so it's not going to be our last.
Only one team from the qualifiers can go to nationals.
The fact that he's not saying that just to be mean
is even more infuriating.
What's going on?
Whoa! It's Shiratorizawa and Seijoh.
Did we just walk in on a tense situation?
Who's the guy in the middle?
It's that one guy!
From the team that beat the two-meter guy, Karasuno!
It's the 10 from Karasuno!
Is he trying to pick a fight with Seijoh and Shiratorizawa?
Holy crap!
A-Anyway, Karasuno's going to win... Eek!
U-Um...
Date Tech
I-I'm so sorry!
It doesn't matter who it is.
We'll gladly accept your challenge.
O-Oh, hi.
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Date Tech!

We're up next!
Let's go!
Yeah!
All right...
We're gonna play more than anyone else here!
Yahoo!
Wha?
There they are, the party team.
Johzenji!
Curse that playboy from Johzenji!
We're gonna have to switch to 24-hour surveillance.
We'll protect Kiyoko-san, even if it means our lives!
Tanaka and Nishinoya are saying something again...
