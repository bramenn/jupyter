Ye Hua!
You plotted to kill my son.
Today, I will have you die by my Soul Slayer!
Attack!
Attack!
Attack!
Why do I feel so flustered tonight?
Ye Hua?
Ye Hua?
Is he asleep?
Ye Hua!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Ye Hua? Ye Hua, wake up! Ye Hua!
- Ye Hua, hold on! Hold on! - Ye Hua?
- Ye Hua, wake up! Wake up! - Ye Hua?
What's wrong, Ye Hua?
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua, wait for me!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!
Who are you?
Where is Ye Hua?
Where is Ye Hua?
Why would you know the crown prince?
Speak!
I don't know any crown prince.
I just want to find Ye Hua.
Where is Ye Hua?
Impudence.
Who are you to speak the crown prince's given name?
Please calm your anger, Father.
Please calm down, Heavenly Lord.
Stop right there.
I did not tell you to rise. You dare to rise?
Do you know what this place is?
This is the Celestial Palace.
Celestial Palace?
Who are you?
How dare you act atrociously in the Celestial Palace?
Nobody can save you.
Even if it is Ye Hua, he wouldn't have the courage to save you.
- Guards. - Present.
Throw this mortal into the Evil Sealing Pagoda.
- Yes. - Yes.
Please save me. Please save me!
You... You are Ye Hua's woman?
Ye Hua and I bowed to heaven and earth.
I am carrying his child in my womb.
Can you bring me to see him?
Bring me to him, please?
What did you say?
Stand up.
Come with me.
Kneel.
Your Highness.
She really is carrying Ye Hua's child in her womb.
Are you certain? Could there be a mistake?
Your Highness, you know very well
in the Celestial Palace, aside from Medicine King
I am the only one who can read a pulse most accurately.
Father.
She really is carrying Ye Hua's child.
It is still not known whether Ye Hua is dead or alive.
Please save his only child.
Le Xu.
She and Ye Hua have violated heaven's law.
You want me to spare her.
Wouldn't that be telling me to bend the law?
She truly is carrying Ye Hua's child.
Or, why don't you punish her after she gives birth to the child?
Or, I am willing to carry the punishment in her place.
Father.
I did not teach my son well.
I am willing to suffer the punishment for this mortal.
Please save Ye Hua's child.
Take this mortal to the unoccupied Zhaohua Palace
and place a strict watch on her.
Thank you, Father.
Thank you, Father.
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
Let me out!
Let me out!
I want to be with Ye Hua!
I want to be with him!
Let me out!
Ye Hua! Don't die!
Ye Hua.
Ye Hua.
Ye Hua.
Ye Hua!
Medicine King, come quick. Crown Prince is waking.
His Highness has survived this trial.
Medicine King, step out first.
I have to speak with Crown Prince.
- This... - Go out.
Yes.
Third Uncle.
What went wrong?
What about Su Su?
Ye Hua, listen to me.
Three days ago, after you were slashed by the Mermaid Clan's Soul Slayer
your wife in the mortal realm dashed through your barrier.
What did you say?
Why?
She rushed through your barrier and was found by Father.
Heavenly Lord... Heavenly Lord.
Ye Hua!
- Let go. - Listen to me!
If you want to save her, then you better stay alive.
If you lose your life, death will come to her shortly after!
She is still alive?
She is alive, she is still alive.
She is carrying your child.
You don't have to worry about her safety.
The Mermaid Clan has been entirely annihilated.
Stay here a few days to recuperate
and then we'll return to the Celestial Palace.
No.
We must not hurry back.
Don't you want to see her sooner?
From the moment Heavenly Lord found out...
it was no longer possible to be with her.
Now the only way to save her life
is to make Heavenly Lord think
that she holds no importance to me.
What did you say?
On the first day of the war, he was slashed by Mermaid Clan's Soul Slayer
and was nearly killed.
Third Prince was afraid news of this would affect the war
so he had the news suppressed.
How is Crown Prince now?
According to Medicine King's diagnosis, Crown Prince has barely saved his spirit.
Good.
You have been following by Crown Prince's side.
How could you let him take such a risk and nearly lose his life?
When the army returns
you will go to Lord Pu Hua for punishment.
Yes.
Wait.
Your Majesty.
Lord of Numinous Treasure' assembly invitations have been sent out.
Everyone will be coming to the Celestial Palace.
I can only go to Chang Sea a few days later.
Have Third Prince take good care of him.
Yes.
Your Highness.
I must see His Majesty.
I'm afraid even if the sky falls down, His Majesty won't be coming here.
Your Highness, Celestial Tribe's Crown Prince
nearly lost his life to the Mermaid Clan at Chang Sea.
Regardless, Mermaid Clan is a part of the Ghost Tribe.
If Celestial Tribe seeks blame
Ghost Tribe will be in deadly danger again.
Back when Qing Cang was sealed away, Ghost Tribe was not in deadly danger.
We won't be now either.
Impudence! How dare you speak Ghost Lord's given name directly?
You are the impudent one.
Could it be that even after 70,000 years has passed
you still only have regard for Qing Cang and not His Majesty?
Ghost Lord?
Who is the true master of Grand Ziming Palace?
Please forgive us, Your Highness.
I can't be bothered with you.
Your Highness, this is an invitation sent from the Celestial Palace.
Invitation?
Lord of Numinous Treasures of the Realm of Supreme Purity
is holding an assembly.
This is the invitation for His Majesty.
You could have just sent someone.
You didn't have to come to the mortal realm yourself.
Ever since the Mermaid Clan was annihilated
the palace has been in turmoil.
The old subjects are afraid the Celestial Tribe will think
the Mermaid Clan is a part of the Ghost Tribe
and direct their anger at us.
They can't find you, so they pester me all day long.
I had no choice
but to use the invitation to come ask you
when you will be returning to the Ghost Realm.
I will go directly to the Celestial Palace.
You are going to the assembly?
To discuss scriptures and Daoism?
When have I ever known how to speak about scriptures?
And how would I know how to discuss Daoism?
I am only going to offer a humble apology and make amends to the Celestial Tribe.
No matter what reason you had
taking my military seal was a huge offense.
Seeing as you and I are husband and wife
I will not punish you.
Return to the palace to reflect on the past.
Your Majesty!
You cannot treat me in this way.
I am... carrying your child in my womb.
What did you say?
That night... I conceived your child.
How is that possible?
Why not?
Don't you want a child?
Your Majesty will be a father.
Aren't you happy?
I have been hoping for this day for 70,000 years.
Never mind.
I'll return to the palace with you.
Medicine King, quick!
This...
- What happened? - Quick, save him.
Your Highness.
Your Highness.
Get out!
You are but my father's consort.
How dare you trespass into the heir apparent's chambers?
Get out right now!
Please let me out. I want to see Ye Hua.
Tell me. Is Ye Hua still alive?
Is he still-
Ye Hua.
Don't die.
Ye Hua.
Ye Hua. I'm begging you, Ye Hua. Say something, please.
Ye Hua?
Ye Hua, say something.
Ye Hua, say something.
Ye Hua! Ye Hua!
Ye Hua!
What? Crown Prince kept a woman in the mortal realm?
This matter must not be made known.
But he already has an engagement with my aunt.
Why did he have to seek other women?
Your Highness, even the mortal realm's emperor
has a harem of countless women
let alone the next Heavenly Lord.
Even if Crown Prince doesn't seek them himself
he will still have many consorts later
to continue bearing a line of heirs for the Celestial Tribe.
Nonsense. A line of heirs?
Qing Qiu has always been one man and one wife.
Our line hasn't ended.
No, I have to find out.
It's locked?
Are you still alive?
I am Bai Feng Jiu of Qing Qiu.
Are you the woman that Ye Hua had in the mortal realm?
You said Ye Hua?
Of course.
He is the Crown Prince.
Who doesn't know of him in the Nine Heavens?
Is he still alive?
I don't know. Did something happen to him?
Not even you know?
Ye Hua.
Wait, wait.
I still have things to ask you.
Don't cry yet.
Wait, wait!
Heavenly Lord won't allow us to speak to the mortal
and won't allow us to speak of this matter.
While Crown Prince is not around, could he be thinking of-
You can't speak of it.
Have you forgotten the incident of the Water King of North Sea?
Clearly, I should be feeling furious on Aunt's behalf.
Why do I still feel a little sad?
This mortal is actually quite pitiful.
I'm not eating. I'm not eating!
I want to see Ye Hua.
Your Majesty, are you really going to the Celestial Palace?
The Mermaid Clan was a part of the Ghost Tribe.
Although they separated from us for 70,000 years
they had severely injured the Crown Prince this time.
It is difficult for me to escape blame.
I can make use of Lord of Numinous Treasure's assembly
to go to the Celestial Palace to apologize
to prevent the Ghost Tribe from being further implicated.
I understand.
Your Majesty is doing so for the sake of the Ghost Tribe.
But, these three days were the happiest I've been in these 70,000 years.
I can't bear for you to leave.
Take good care of your health.
Shaman, how come she is feeling so unwell so early in the pregnancy?
Ghost Queen is an immortal.
The child in her womb is of Ghost Tribe.
There will be times when their essences conflict.
I think with more bed rest
she will naturally feel better as the months go by.
That's good.
I'll have the Shaman stay to keep you company.
No.
You haven't been to the Celestial Palace ever since you took the throne.
Since you are going to an assembly
then as Ghost Queen, I must stay by your side.
You are carrying a child of the Ghost Tribe.
It already disagrees with your immortal essence.
If you go to the Celestial Palace, won't you feel even more unwell?
It does not bother me.
When women in the mortal realm are pregnant
there will be times when they feel unwell.
I am the Ghost Queen. How would I be so delicate?
All right.
In the 49 days of the assembly, Ghost Lord shall stay here.
If you have any requests, please let me know.
Thank you.
I shall take my leave.
May I ask.
Do you know
where the winter lotus sent from the Ghost Realm 70,000 years ago
is being kept now?
Winter lotus? It is in the lotus pond next to the Zhaohua Palace.
- Can you take me there? - Yes.
I'll be back soon.
I just feel a bit...
a bit unwell, so I won't be going with you.
Stay here with her.
Didn't you say you would surely save this child for me?
Why does my stomach constantly hurt?
Perhaps it is because
you have been living in the Ghost Realm for too long as an immortal
and your body has many injuries, so it isn't fit...
to conceive a child.
Not fit?
Then what am I carrying now?
Your Highness, I...
What did you say?
Your Highness, please calm down.
I am speaking the truth.
The young prince no longer has any signs of being alive.
I think Your Highness should return to the Ghost Realm.
I will give you a medicine, and have the young prince...
Your Highness, now that it has come to this
your own health is more important.
No.
I must save this child!
Didn't you see?
In these 70,000 years, His Majesty has never treated me with such patience.
I must keep this child.
I must!
You are not allowed to tell anybody. Do you hear me?
Otherwise, I will take your life. Your entire clan's life!
I will definitely keep my mouth shut.
Where is that peach blossom fragrance coming from? It is so familiar.
Ghost Lord?
Lord of Numinous Treasures.
It has been many millennia since I last saw you.
Seeing your back just now, I wasn't certain it was you.
Yes, it's been 70,000 years.
I remember the first time I met you was at Kunlun Mountain.
Just now, I heard the palace maids say
you had just arrived.
How come you would be in the mood to admire this lotus?
I came to see the winter lotus.
I'm afraid it had been in the Ghost Realm for too long
and is not used to the Celestial Realm's lotus pond.
I did not expect you to be such an attentive person.
You would be so concerned about a lotus.
- Fire! Help put out the fire! - Help! Fire!
- Someone! Help! - Zhaohua Palace!
Quickly find someone to put out the fire. There's still someone inside.
How come there is a fire?
It is my mount who has caused this trouble.
Please forgive me, Lord.
You need not blame yourself too much.
- Is this lady hurt? - I am not certain.
I'm taking her back to Realm of Supreme Purity
and have my shaman take a look.
A-Yin.
A-Yin.
Her? How come she is here?
No, it's impossible.
Your Majesty, it must be a Celestial transformed. It must be.
They know Your Majesty had a relationship to Si Yin
and must have transformed someone into Si Yin's image to deceive you.
Shaman!
- Your Majesty. - Quick, treat her injuries.
She was hurt by crimson hellfire. Quick!
Yes.
How is she?
She may be an immortal
but being injured by crimson hellfire can be very troublesome.
Do you think she needs...
Your Majesty.
This is just a mortal.
What? Mortal?
Mortal?
Yes, Your Majesty. She is not an immortal.
She is just a mortal woman.
Are you certain?
There is no sign of immortal essence.
She is indeed a mortal.
I was confused.
I actually failed to tell the difference between immortal and mortal.
- Treat her injuries. - Yes.
Rather than say her face looks like Si Yin
I'd say she looks more like Bai Qian.
Fortunately, she is neither.
Come in.
Your Majesty, I have done wrong.
Do you know this is not Ghost Realm's Grand Ziming Palace?
This is the Nine Heavens.
Why did you use crimson hellfire in the Celestial Palace?
I passed by that abandoned palace
and felt that fragrance was so familiar, so I followed the scent
and saw this woman locked in the chambers and she was crying.
So...
So I wanted to help her out.
But the lock on the door was millennium cold iron
and my powers could not break it.
So you used fire to burn it off?
Didn't Your Majesty say crimson hellfire can exterminate all living things?
That is correct.
It can exterminate all living things.
That is why you are unable to control the intensity of the fire.
You wanted to burn the lock
so naturally, the chamber would burn as well.
Forget it.
I just hope Heavenly Lord will not pursue this incident.
Where is Ye Hua?
What is this place?
Do you feel better?
Who are you?
I am Ghost Lord Li Jing.
Just now, it was my mount who accidentally set the fire.
I am truly sorry.
So it was a fire set by you.
I thought they wanted to take my life.
They?
How old are you?
70,300 years old.
70,300 years old?
Sister, the peach blossom scent on you smells so nice.
Why would a mortal be living in the Celestial Palace?
I was seized by them.
Have you seen Ye Hua?
Where is he?
How is he?
Ye Hua?
Who are you to the Crown Prince?
I am Crown Prince Ye Hua's mother, Consort Le Xu.
Greetings, Consort Le Xu.
No need to stand on ceremony, Ghost Lord.
I heard you saved someone of mine.
I came to express my thanks
and take my person back.
This lady belongs to your palace?
That is correct.
This lady violated some of heaven's law.
I had her locked in Zhaohua Palace to reflect on her mistakes.
I did not expect a fire to break out and for her to be saved by you.
Go and take her away.
Yes.
I take my leave now.
Farewell, Your Highness.
Your Majesty, that lady is with child.
- I'm afraid... - With child?
Your Majesty, the Celestial Tribe has always taken their laws seriously.
For them to keep a mortal in custody, and one that is pregnant
this matter must not be simple.
I came on this trip to the Celestial Palace to apologize.
As for other people, there is nothing I can do.
