This is a story about my father, my mother, and me.
About our family of three.
I first came here a year ago now.
On my 18th birthday,
I came into possession of a secret key.
A side of him that I never knew is here.
I was scared.
I worried that learning what my father hid from me
might ruin my impression of all the fun times we had together.
What were you hiding?
Hime!
Be careful today.
You too, Dad!
Can't you change in the phone booth, Clark Kent?
My father was hiding
My father was hiding
that he drew for a living.
It all started 19 years ago.
She's a cute little girl!
Please, hold her.
Okay!
Congratulations!
Hm?
Wait, are you?
The manga author, Goto Kakushi?!
I've read all of Testi-Coool!
I love your manga!
Testi?
Coool?
Oh, I know that one! It's all pervy!
It's all pervy!
That's when my father, for my sake,
swore to hide his profession for his whole life.
That takes me back! Testi-Coool, right?
I used to copy it and get in so much trouble
I used to copy it and get in so much trouble
Hey.
I told you to never leave one of my books out at the office, didn't I?
I-It's my own copy.
Why do I take the weekly manuscript,
and put it in storage far away, huh?!
Why do I keep this place from looking like a manga author's office?!
If by some chance Hime came,
if Hime learned her father writes a manga full of dirty jokes,
what would you do then, huh?!
She'd close her heart, and no matter what I say,
If you have something to say, put it in a manga.
If she said that, Daddy couldn't go on living!
Even if you say that,
how long do you think we can hide this, anyway?
You're new here, so you might not know,
but he leaves home in a suit to avoid discovery,
but he leaves home in a suit to avoid discovery,
then changes while he's on his way here.
then changes while he's on his way here.
Why don't you just draw in your suit?
Why don't you just draw in your suit?
He can't draw unless he's in those loose clothes.
Even that's a huge improvement, you know.
It used to be he could only draw naked!
You're kidding.
Eccentric artists are a common thing.
Well, in Goto's case,
his thing was what was common.
But he did put in some blood, sweat, and tears to get to where he is now.
After Hime was born, get it?
Hime, what does your daddy do for work?
I dunno!
But he does work.
That's no good.
Ms. Ichiko said not to ask people what their mommies and daddies do!
Why not?
Because personal info can lead to work discrimination.
Right, Ms. Ichiko?
That's right. Don't ask if they don't want to say.
Ms. Ichiko!
Ugh, fine.
That's a good girl, Hina.
I think drawing manga is a respectable job, though.
Why are you hiding it from Hime?
I don't draw One Piece or Anpanman.
I know that!
I read Testi-Coool!
I'm a fan of your work!
Please never say those words again.
Mr. Goto?
If you ever said it in front of Hime,
there's no telling what'd happen to me!
But Goto, you're already plenty famous!
You can be more confident!
You have no idea how society treats manga authors.
At all!
Ah, Mr. Goto!
I heard from another customer. You're a manga author?
See! You're famous!
Some neighborhood kids asked me to get your autograph for them.
Could you draw PolyCure for them?!
See?
You drew it?!
And well, too
A new editor?
I'm your new editor, Tomaruin.
The giveaway T-shirts are done, so I'll deliver them.
Another new editor, huh?
I hope the last one trained him well.
You've got a lot of annoying stipulations, after all.
He's not coming?
Maybe he's lost?
Maybe he went to your house by mistake?
Goto!
Dammit, what were you thinking?!
If the editor went to my house
Hime would find out I'm a manga author!
Hime!
But really, there's no way an editor would accidentally go to my house
Ah, Dad!
Hi there!
He is here!
I brought the giveaway T-shirts.
I brought the giveaway T-shirts.
He's wearing one!
I'm your new editor, Tomaruin Satsuki.
Nice to meet you, I'm Goto.
A little close, aren't you?
I'll go pour you some tea, Dad.
Please, take your time.
Asshole, why'd you wear it here?!
You damn dick cheese!
I thought you'd be happy I wore it!
I didn't want to wear this embarrassing thing.
That's why I said to make a wearable one!
When making a T-shirt as a gift for readers,
authors always want a wearable one.
authors always want a wearable one.
If large images of characters are printed on it,
people will be less willing to wear it in public,
but if it's just text,
or character silhouettes,
or pixels that look like a character's face
You can't tell what manga this came from, can you?
Use the normal one.
Strip!
Power harassment!
Then just cover the picture!
As naturally as possible!
Sorry it took so long.
Is he a higher-up?
I'll go get the good snacks!
Hime!
She's gonna think her father has a younger boss!
Try again!
Are you a mommy?
What kind of interpretation is that?
What kind of interpretation is that?
I don't know, but hide it some other way!
Are you a pastry chef?
A piano teacher?
A host?
I'm not sure whether to call those original,
or just plain out there, but
That's enough!
I'll go bring in some fresh tea.
Good.
What are you trying to do?
Watch, new guy.
I've been doing this for over twenty years.
I'm a manga author.
My job is
all about drawing!
I'll redraw it until you can't recognize who it once was!
With PolyCure.
Have you no pride?!
Oh, PolyCure!
What?! No way!
Someone asked me what you do today, Dad.
I said you do work.
Well, I'm definitely not on welfare.
You mean on welfare as in not working?
Welfare also means health and happiness, right?
They're both welfare, but
Hime?
Then you must make a lot of people happy!
You can probably make anyone happy!
Hime, that's really sweet.
Was that guy earlier the CEO?
He wore a T-shirt and looked important!
Hime, you know what CEO means?
I'm so proud.
I saw it on World Business Satellite!
That late at night
You should be in bed by then, Hime.
She finally found out, huh?
Did you give her the key, Rasuna?
I couldn't.
I don't have that right.
Still I'm amazed we hid it this long.
Well, it's not like she tried to find out.
This is what he did for a living?
The father who lived here with an ocean view
He's like a stranger to me.
But I'm sure he was well loved by many people.
But I'm sure he was well loved by many people.
You didn't have to hide it.
Why did you go so far to keep it a secret,
Dad?
Someone, help! My cat fell in the river!
Thank you so much! Um who are you?
Nobody worth knowing.
I can't tell her!
What if she found out?!
Go up the hill, cross Old Yamato Avenue to the other district,
then I change jobs,
then I change jobs.
Yes, my hidden job is a drawing job.
I hope this dries fast.
What happened, man?
What should I write to put up at home,
if I want to make Dad happy?
My mommy said that promotions are everything for men. They want to be important!
Important?
What does she mean, important?
What's going on now?
For a manga author to be important
They've got to sell.
I know, right? How can I make my work sell?
By the way, these are what's selling now.
Hm. Hmm
Got it.
I'll make a dark fantasy manga!
What, that suddenly?!
But you're always saying you won't bow to society's whims!
Huh? I'm just bowing to Hime here!
Sales make you important?
Only rotten capitalist pigs say that.
You were here, Kakei?
Sorry I'm so invisible.
I'm back!
I'm back!
Sorry I'm late! But I got to have a lot of fun!
Sorry I'm late! But I got to have a lot of fun!
That's just the thing!
Rasuna, I hear you're assisting on a weekly manga now?
Cool! Is it famous?
That's awesome!
They really made a fuss over me!
Like I'm at the top, y'know?
Like I'm at the top, y'know?
And what makes you think of yourself as important based on just that?
Well, in the eyes of society, famous equals important.
Then if I want to become important and grant Hime's wish,
I just need to become famous!
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but won't Hime find out if you get famous?
Probably even if you started selling well.
Are you crying?
When I think I might have to avoid selling well forever
It might be easier to try to sell, you know.
Yeah
There's a hero who saved a cat!
He left without saying his name. As a cat lover,
I want to find him and thank him!
Then we have to make a detective agency!
That sounds fun! Finding the perp, huh?
Well, he's not a perp.
Kids form detective agencies quickly.
According to eyewitness reports, the target fled uphill.
Then let's search at the top of the hill!
What's wrong, Hime?
Dad says there's a monster called a fashionista up there, so I can't go.
Fashionista?!
But monsters don't really exist!
Oh, what's wrong?
Ms. Ichiko!
Fashionista?
Well, they're definitely hostile to me.
Hostile?!
Fashionistas go to bookstores without manga,
and have drinks that sound like spells.
I've endured some terrible things because of them.
What should we do? Call it off?
Oh?
You're back early today, Clark Kent.
I'm on break.
And you've got as few customers as ever.
Oh, but business is booming today.
Goto, you're pretty fashionable, keeping a workplace in this town.
Sarcasm?
Of course.
Fashionistas live here, you see.
They're only interested in themselves.
So you chose here to avoid prying eyes?
And there are bookstores with no manga that I can relax in.
What if we meet a fashionista?
It'll be fine! I'll protect all of you!
Why'd the hero have to go up the hill?
He's a hero. Maybe he was getting rid of the monsters!
I found a manga!
You have nerves of steel.
You never know when a fashionista might show up!
I know, already!
Oh no! A fashionista monster!
Wait right there!
A monster? Fashionista?!
Is that a compliment or a diss?!
Which is it, kids?!
Hime! But I told her never to come here!
Wow, nice shot.
This is the legendary ring that saved the cat!
The hero did come to get rid of the monsters!
It's just like in a dark fantasy world!
I'll die a million times over if Hime sees me like this!
Please, wait, Mr. Hero!
This is the start of our dark fantasy, huh!
Ah, he went in there!
This is a bookstore?
If it is, something feels off
I got it!
There's no manga here!
Is this what Ms. Ichiko was talking about?!
A fashionista nest?!
Venti non-fat milk add whipped cream chocolate chips
vanilla creme banana nut chocolate latte.
Ice double tall double.
They're chanting some kind of spell!
That mark!
It really is!
It's a fashionista nest!
Wait, is this maybe a Sta
Look over there!
Mr. Hero?
Mr. Hero came to save us!
No way! There's no way the hero who saved a cat could be so sloppy!
And he's drinking witch juice!
He's one of the monsters!
If there's no manga, then
The monsters' weakness is manga!
I get it!
I found this earlier
Take this, monster!
Run away!
I think this really is a Sta
Come on, Hime!
This
Are you crying?
A lot of things I can't understand just happened
I guess I really do need to start selling
Yeah, you do.
Today I played dark fantasy with my friends!
We ran away from fashionistas!
You shouldn't play dangerous games, though.
Okay.
Lights out.
Okay.
Hey, Hime.
Why'd you write that you wish I was important?
Oh!
That?
I thought it'd make you happy!
Is that all?
Huh? You're not happy?
No, I'm definitely happy.
But what makes me happiest
Happiest of all
No matter what happens, let's raise her well until the very end.
is you growing up big and strong, Hime.
Big and strong?
Maybe I should drink Yakult!
In that case, you can also make my wish come true.
In that case, you can also make my wish come true.
I don't really remember much about my mother.
Why isn't she around?
My father never talked about it.
But
my mother was the type to prepare for anything.
Whatever I might need as I grew up,
she boxed it up in advance.
When I was still young, that made me so happy.
Every year,
I'd open a box on my birthday.
I looked forward to it so much.
As you'd expect, as the years passed, they'd diverge from the trends,
and there was a fair amount of confusing stuff,
but
as confusing as they were,
they let me feel the times my mother saw,
and I treasured them even more.
There are more of Mom's boxes?
Why are they here?
Hime?
Hime, you're such a good artist! Daddy's no match for you.
- Dad! - Dad.
I call you Dad, so stop calling yourself Daddy.
I have to because you won't, Hime
You're late! Where were you?
Sorry, sorry. What should we buy next?
Want to use my scarf?
No, Daddy's fine.
Besides, I had fun today
Wow! A treehouse!
Hime! That's dangerous! Come down!
I get it
Dad left these boxes for me.
You don't need to put such big chunks of meat in the curry.
This notebook was in the age 10 box!
This notebook was in the age 10 box!
Daddy wants to try your cooking, too.
I'll do my best!
Little Hime's my fan!
I aspire to be an idol!
She says you and I have a really strong guardian spirit,
and it'll protect us, so don't worry!
Are you okay, Hime?!
I'm fine.
If I have a savior like Hime,
I might be able to rewrite my life!
That's what I thought!
Her life's savior, huh?
It's a gold medal! I made it at school.
Hime?
You're a gold medalist to me!
Thanks, Hime.
He shamelessly sent one again?
It's from Mr. Datena Oto.
But you already have the one Daddy bought you.
Yeah, and it's my favorite.
But I feel bad for Mr. Datena,
so I tried wearing both!
Hime's such a nice girl.
Okay, we'll take a picture of you wearing it again this year.
Leave it closed so he can't see it's empty.
Date Naoto again?
Who's that?
He's shameless, sending a new backpack every year.
Ah, this is one of those stories everyone's heard, huh?
So, who's Date Naoto?
That's his private life
Don't go sticking your foot in it!
There's no way Date Naoto's a good guy.
First of all, the Date Naotos of the world are wrong.
I bought a backpack for you. Isn't that sleazy?
It should be, I had the honor of buying you a backpack!
Buying a backpack is a privilege!
Buying a backpack is a privilege!
Being a parent
means beating out everyone who wants to buy one,
means beating out everyone who wants to buy one,
and earning the right to buy it,
so it's not a stranger's place to buy one!
That's your problem?
Come to think of it, the right to buy a backpack
might go for a pretty high price.
And is the guy sending you backpacks a stranger?
Yeah, he's a stranger. To me.
She's so cute
You're in a good mood today.
Whaaat?!
I have to go to a signing? Me?!
Tomaruin, you bastard! Why'd you okay this?!
So he did it without asking you?
If I show my face in public and Hime finds out, what then?!
I have to turn it down!
It's too late to cancel.
They've advertised it online.
And on a Sunday, of all days?
That's when Hime and I
I'm looking forward to Sunday!
You finally got a reservation at KidZanira!
KidZanira?
A theme park that's popular with kids.
They can try out a bunch of different jobs.
It's supposedly a pain to get a reservation.
I'm off.
Good work today.
Goto's been kinda low-energy lately.
Did something happen?
Yeah, probably.
Could you stop sending backpacks already?
How am I even supposed to explain it?
You're still holding that grudge?
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.
Since you're a father yourself, can't you understand my feelings a little?
If, one day, Hime brings home a man she says she wants to marry,
and he wrote a manga called Testi-Coool,
would you accept him?
Who the hell would accept that?!
See?
See you.
He's got a point.
I'd never give Hime to someone who wrote manga like mine.
I'd never give her to him!
I'm conflicted!
An autograph from the author of Testi-Coool?
Who the heck wants that?
Yeah, something went and killed his confidence.
If nobody's coming to the signing, I'm gonna go play with Hime!
Come on, you can't just
This means
You might be able to do both.
Basically, at KidZanira, adults watch their kids from the lounge.
What of it?
You can do the signing during that time!
Look!
The signing venue is in the same building!
Whoa, how lucky!
No kidding!
Wait, that's too close!
If Hime were to take a wrong turn
Dad?
No, no, no, no, no! No way in hell!
But you don't have any other choice.
We'll all help you out.
Okay, adults aren't allowed past here.
Here I go!
Have fun!
Goto.
Over here!
So you can do signings in those clothes?
Of course I can't.
It's right around that corner.
No, I'm leaving!
What's gotten into you?!
Nobody's gonna come, anyway!
That's how unconfident he is?
Don't worry! Plenty of people are coming.
It'll be fine. Hurry up!
No, no, no, no! Stop!
Wow!
Now that's a line!
What did I say?
Plenty of people are coming.
Mori!
A mascot's
signing session?
See?
Nobody's here.
Well, there's still an hour until the start time.
And we did draw 100 tickets for pre-registers!
I bet they were people who thought I was famous,
signed up hoping to resell,
learned I wasn't,
and decided not to come. I'm sure of it.
I understand your anxiety,
but the most anxious ones here
are the bookstore's staff!
It's not you?
The staff are desperate not to bring authors shame!
If it comes to it, they'll line up themselves in plain clothes!
I knew it!
Okay. I've remembered all of your faces.
If I catch you lining up
I'll cry!
Ugh, another annoying author?
They really do have a lot of job experiences.
I'll go over it with you once more.
Signings are a race against time.
If you're drawing characters, limit it to one per person.
Also, to prevent reselling,
make sure to write their name.
Okay, it's about time to start.
If you've got schoolkids lining up, let'em in.
Okay, guests are coming through!
Thanks for doing this!
I'm a big fan of your work!
Forget the kids, this is a teacher!
How could I not have foreseen this walking disaster lining up?!
I applied and won a ticket fair and square!
One signing, please!
Here.
Thank you so much!
Thanks for doing this!
I don't remember her.
Maybe she's a real fan?
Momo, you came!
Yeah! I won a ticket! Lucky me!
I could have gotten you one if you asked!
That'd be unfair!
Here you go.
Thanks a bunch!
She's a friend from college,
and she's been a fan for a while!
You think I believe that?
Guess not.
This is misery.
Nobody wins when you try to cheer me up like that.
But these guys are being forced to line up, so why do they look happy?
I get it! They're!
Part-timer, right?
Y-Yeah, how'd you know?
I'm a part-timer.
I knew it!
I do graveyards at a corner store, but want to draw manga!
Thanks for this!
You a part-timer, too?
No, I'm contracted.
Finally, someone who admits he was sent here!
Just can't get into full employment.
How much are they paying you?
I'm from the countryside, so about 850 yen per hour.
Oh, but they do reimburse travel expenses!
Do they?
Goto, we finished 50 in the morning session, so it's time for a break.
Hey, Tomaruin.
How about raising their pay a little?
Huh?
Well, I promised Hime I'd have lunch with her, so
I made this in the store!
It looks like you had a lot of fun.
I was chasing quality!
What other jobs did you try?
Pastry chef, delivery, and police officer!
Ah, I wish it could be like this forever.
Goto! It's almost time for the afternoon session!
Please, hurry!
Goto, what are you doing?
Oh.
This is happening in Ueno, right?
You know it?
He's a master of Japanese painting.
I love his paintings, and really respect him.
He's that talented?
A master of the arts?
We both draw for a living,
but there's a world of difference between our works.
You're late, Goto!
We're still doing more?
Nobody wins when you do this.
I think I just realized what you meant!
There's no way they're all be paid to be here!
Got proof?
We couldn't possibly afford to pay them all for you, of all people!
What's with the of all people?!
Do you have pride or not? Make it clear, man.
Look at these. Your fans sent you letters and presents.
Would part-timers go that far for you?
These people actually like your manga.
Have some confidence.
Okay, starting the afternoon session!
Thank you!
I can't believe it,
but these people all
read my manga.
But Hime still can't
One, please!
You brought your kid?
Do you know what I draw?
It's dirty jokes.
Yeah, I know.
We're both fans.
Dad, it's Tights!
Isn't that great?
Yay! Yeah!
That's why I said to have some confidence.
See? Even a little kid like that likes it.
Yeah, even a little kid like that.
If I hired him, it'd be an ethical violation.
That's your point?!
Well,
I just draw the manga I believe in.
Good.
Looks like his confidence is back!
No matter what some arts master says,
my job is drawing manga!
S-She found out?!
Hurry and trade! We're supposed to take turns!
What are you doing, Ms. Ichiko?
W-Work experience.
Oh, so this is KidZanira for adults!
Yeah, that's it!
The adults must get bored waiting, too.
Ah, I need to look for Dad.
He didn't come get me on time!
He must be lost.
Is this so different from what you wear at home she didn't recognize you?
For once, your manga author cosplay came in handy.
It's not cosplay!
Here, Dad! I got you a present!
What's this for?
I paid for it with my work!
By work, you mean at KidZanira?
You work, and they pay you in money called KidZa.
Then you use that to buy things at the shop!
Hime worked and bought this for me?
Thank you.
But the tickets had to be more expensive, right?
I mean, you paid so that I could work
I mean, even my job was originally something I paid people to let me do.
I wonder
How long can I keep doing it?
This job
Hey, Dad.
The adults' KidZanira also has a job introduction office!
Dad, have you ever been?
Maybe I'll go someday.
Dad
After discovering the boxes in the closet, I was sure of it.
This house, with its ocean breeze,
has the exact same floor plan as the house in Nakameguro.
The yard where I played with Dad,
and the hall where I called in my friends,
and even the closet with the boxes I opened each birthday,
were the same as back then,
quietly waiting for me to get here.
Manga?
It was
an almost painfully boring manga.
It had no swords or magic in it.
There were no wild events.
It just had a father, a mother, and a daughter. A family of three.
And it showed them all living a normal life.
Do you think Hime's okay?
Of course she is.
Wait, weren't you the one who suggested we secretly follow her, Riko?
Well, I guess so.
And what brings you all here? A class reunion?
You could have invited me, then.
M-Ms. Ichiko?
You
Where's your jersey?!
That's what you ask?
I have good news and bad news, one each.
This is also the same as in Nakameguro.
About the only difference is the ocean view.
That's it! This house
Originally, we three,
my father, my mother, and I were supposed to live together in this house.
The image of a family of three living there,
looking so happy
Even after my mother passed,
my father didn't want me to have any sad memories,
so he tried to bring back a normal life that should have been far out of reach.
He gave his all to raising me.
He believed that was what my mother wanted,
He believed that was what my mother wanted,
even though it had to be hard for him.
even though it had to be hard for him.
You were too soft,
Dad.
I keep thinking about it
Going on a father-daughter trip
What will people think?
We've awaited your arrival.
Goto, party of three, yes?
No, just two
Yes, party of three!
Party of three!
I see. So inns like this count the dog, too?
I was sure they were assuming her mother was here, too.
Tatami rooms dogs can stay in are rare, huh?
Is that a selling point for this inn?
We're also proud of our hot spring, too.
It's said to have been the Tokugawa family's secret spring.
Secret spring?
What's a secret spring?
Oh, it's a hot spring that's been hidden so other people can't find it, I guess?
It'd be nicer if they didn't hide it, so everyone could use it.
It sure would.
Though it's said that hot spring inns have a lot of secrets.
Like secret extramarital affairs,
or hideouts for politicians to escape the media.
Please enjoy your stay.
Or policies not to investigate their staff's past
Roku, stop! No barking!
You need to be a gentledog here!
Maybe there's another dog in the room next door?
Or rooms where something happened.
Hot spring, hot spring, a dip before dinner!
I'm a little worried They say the hot spring bath is big.
I'm worried to send her in alone,
but more worried to bring her with me!
And if I try to check on her, I'll get arrested!
What should I do in a situation like this?!
Just kidding.
I love her so much,
there's no way I wouldn't prepare for this.
I'm counting on you.
Roger.
I never expected to be called a bath worker.
We're lucky to get to come here for free,
but why are you so worried about the bath?
It's obvious!
How many Japanese do you think die in baths?!
Not to mention all the trashy hot springs bits in manga give me a bad feeling!
I'm counting on you. Protect Hime!
Okay.
We'll let you know if anything happens.
Let's go!
Huh? Hime?!
Ah, Dad!
That was a good bath!
Y-You're already done?
Yeah! I was worried about Roku,
but you can take your time, Dad!
Is that mission complete for us?
Yeah
You don't wanna come over here?
We're all ready for you.
That's enough of that.
The crab's tasty, huh?
Yeah.
I've had enough of these secrets!
I'm gonna come clean to my wife, divorce her, and marry you for real!
T-This is tasty, too, huh?
Is something wrong?
I'm just moved by how tasty the food is.
Thank you, Hiruo,
but I've also been hiding something.
I'm actually not 26. I'm 40!
I'm also twice divorced, and five million yen in debt!
I don't care! I'm glad you told me!
What's going on here?
I've also had enough of these secrets!
This dog I gave you as a birthday present!
He's not a chihuahua! He's a mongrel!
A chihuahua?
What are you saying? He's already the only dog for me!
I don't care what breed he is!
But I'm glad you told me.
And I'm glad I got it off my chest.
Dogs are cute no matter the breed.
Exactly! Breed discrimination is bad!
While we're at it, though, I've also been hiding something from you.
And I've been hiding that I already realized it!
How about it, everyone?
This is a great opportunity to come clean and drop your baggage!
I was actually laid off,
but pretended to go to work and then killed time at a park!
I embezzled government funds, and then hid that I came here!
I hid that my eyes, nose, mouth, and jawbone all had plastic surgery!
About that Izu highland beef I just fed you all
It was actually imported beef from a country I'd never heard of!
What's going on?!
Oh, are you going next?
Huh? No, I'm not hiding any
Come on. You should confess what you're hiding and take a load off.
It's so freeing!
Get rid of the baggage you're carrying!
Come on! Come on!
- What's up with this sympathetic pressure? - Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
I've
I've been hiding
What?!
What happened?!
Oh, it's you.
I saw a dark silhouette moving inside this room!
This is
I've had enough of these secrets!
The truth is
This room is actually haunted!
The ghost of Mr. Tanabata haunts it,
and every night he works on his unfinished book.
N-N-N-N-No way!
You must be joking!
Ah, but it feels good to get that off my chest.
It's so wonderful to not be hiding anything!
What about your name?
I found him. Tanabata Yasunari.
Vomited blood while writing in an inn.
Later died at a hospital, huh?
Bloody vomit, double suicides
The writers of the past sure were some dramatic characters.
Well, it's the author's own character that's on display in their work.
Do you think I'd sell more if I vomited some blood?
People would just laugh if someone who writes dirty jokes did that.
Yeah, I guess
Besides, serious conditions like vomiting blood are a minus for comedy authors.
It'd be harder to laugh.
Really, using a naked photo to add character
might actually be a type of camouflage!
Ah, sorry, I was imagining things!
I just thought you'd never do anything so stupid otherwise!
You say some hurtful things!
Goto, are you hiding something?
When anything unpleasant or worrying happened,
my father had a habit of coming in the back door.
Those days,
he'd try not to worry me by saying,
I leveled up, or I've been scouted, or I got a new job.
But I understood that they all meant he quit his job.
So the job he quit that time
was a drawing job?
The book says it's because he stopped selling.
You know that's not true.
He chose to put down the pen.
It's kinda cool if you put it like that.
He just couldn't draw anymore.
No matter what I draw, nobody will laugh, he said.
Goto even hid things from his readers.
You didn't have to actually say it.
Goto did nothing wrong.
But
there are a fair number of readers
who can't separate the author from the work.
Having your tragic private life exposed is fatal for a comedy author.
On my 18th birthday,
I got the key to this house,
and learned what my father was hiding.
It touched on all the memories he left behind,
but
that wasn't the end of it.
It wasn't only me who came to this house on that day.
Why did Dad quit his drawing job?
Who are you?
Nice to meet you,
sister.
Did Dad have an illegitimate child?
Wrong.
Then, maybe am I
someone else's child?
That's wrong, too.
If anything
Dad was an illegitimate child?
How do you know that?
Wait Didn't I see you on TV recently?
You were named the successor to some kabuki actor
Something-emon?
Try a little harder than that.
An unwed concubine's kid, huh?
You knew?
Yeah, I guess. He was definitely eccentric enough.
If he took a different path, he might have been a kabuki actor right now.
That'd be a laugh.
So
this is Imashigata Kairi?
Hime's maternal grandfather's painting?
Hime's grandpa was pretty amazing.
It's no wonder. She comes from a line of artists.
Kabuki actors and Japanese painters?
As for why they opposed Goto's marriage
Maybe it's not because of his manga,
but rather because of a feud between incompatible artistic senses?
Basically, your dad and my mom are half-siblings.
I never knew Dad had a sister.
Surprised?
Why?
If anything,
I'm relieved that we were actually father and daughter.
You actually thought you might not be?
I mean, Dad was too soft.
Information about the accident touches on private info,
so you'll have to go through a lawyer for it.
I see
Excuse me!
I was working with Goto on that day.
I see
You're researching the accident?
Don't worry, it's not for an article.
Then why is a reporter?
Personal interest.
If it can change the status quo, even a little
The company's staying quiet,
but it wasn't Goto's fault.
Whoa! Are these all JUMBO?
People say print's dying out, but they're still selling this much?
Let's hurry and finish this.
Goto!
Somebody! Call an ambulance!
Goto! Goto!
Somebody pulled out a copy to read. That threw off the balance.
They probably wanted to leak it online, and become an overnight hero.
The company really cracks down on that stuff.
It wasn't Goto, of course.
Goto said he hated manga.
I'll bet.
I think it was the patient in this room?
Wow. For more than a year?
It's ironic, isn't it.
He ran away from manga,
but ended up crushed by manga.
That's karma for you.
If it was SATADAY or MANGAZINE instead of JUMBO,
there wouldn't have been enough to crush him.
Hey.
Back then, he was doing physical labor, even though he wasn't used to it.
He was in enough financial trouble he had to sell his house.
He had savings, right?
He spent most of it
searching for his wife.
It was a boating accident just after Hime's birth.
She was still missing, even after the search teams were called off,
so he hired a contractor,
and kept searching, never giving up hope.
For over ten years, while drawing manga.
Then, when Hime was in middle school,
it was leaked somewhere.
They took the fact he was waiting for his wife,
They took the fact he was waiting for his wife,
and published it in a weekly gossip mag.
No matter what I draw, nobody will laugh, he said.
And then he put down the pen.
Still, he did finish Tights before he stopped.
It was a good, if standard, ending.
He suffered for losing his job and his income,
but at least Hime
got to go to high school without issue, yeah.
But, ironically
Hime took after her grandfather,
and inherited his talent.
While he was a manga author, and even after he quit,
Dad always smiled in front of me.
He was just too soft.
My mom told me that she was always worried about you.
Wait, the person who gave me the key
Was my mom.
Give this to Hime.
If anything should happen to me, please.
Sell everything in this house,
and use the money to help her.
Please.
I see
Though, for all that, it's not really empty.
It may have embarrassed him,
but I think my mom wanted you to see it.
Your dad's work.
Dad's drawing job?
Goto is?!
Well! I'm heading home.
I didn't know what to do if you were crying,
but you seem fine.
Yeah. Thanks.
Hime!
Ms. Ichiko! And you guys?
Whoa! A hottie's here, of all places?
Hina!
Hime! Your father regained consciousness!
No way!
Is that the good news?
Then what's the bad news?
Dad is
Dad
Who are you?
You're
Who, again?
Amnesia?! That's too cliche!
That word wouldn't even fly in manga!
Tomaruin, this is a hospital.
Plus, Goto only just revived.
He wasn't dead, man.
Goto, you forgot about Hime?!
Huh? How could I forget about Hime?
She's just ten years old.
His memories are probably the same as from when you were ten.
He's just lost the last seven years.
Why seven years?
I couldn't say.
Maybe something left a big impression on him back then?
That's pretty common in cases of memory loss.
Seven years ago, huh?
When Hime was ten
Was there anything that impactful?
Maybe it's when he had the most fun?
Both at work and at home.
I see.
It was when I was his editor.
That's not it.
Hey! Let me go!
Hey! Let me go!
You can't until you do your rehab and get your strength back!
Goto!
What happened?
He tried to escape!
I'm worried about Hime! Let me see her!
Hey! Calm down, Mr. Goto!
Goto.
I know you want to see her,
but wouldn't she worry if she saw you like this?
You're right
I can't let her see me like this.
That's right.
First you need rehab so you can be healthy again.
And right now you can pretty much only move your fingers freely.
My fingers?
Then
I need to at least work on Tights! The readers deserve more!
Oh, that one? It's been a while since we can
Concluded it?
He thinks it's still being serialized.
We should tell him the truth.
It'd be too much of a shock for him.
Uh what should we do here?
Why'd it come to this?
It's been a while since we worked together like this.
I never thought I'd hold a pen like this again.
Is this what Dad's job was like?
Hey, you.
Yes?
You're a new assistant?
Uh, well yes?
I can't leave right now,
so I'm sorry, but I need you to do something.
What is it?
I'm worried for my daughter, Hime.
Before the housekeeper gets to the house,
Hime's fine alone, but could you watch over her?
I asked Tomaruin last time, but he was no help.
That hurts.
Yes.
Thanks.
There's still some time before Hime gets home.
You can just relax until then.
Goto!
Is there anything else I can help with until then,
Goto?
Hime.
We'll help.
Can I ask a question?
Did you really not realize what your Dad's job was?
I really didn't know.
I never knew, and just enjoyed his kind softness.
But I think my father really did love drawing manga.
I just saw him working for the first time.
He was really focused,
but he looked like he was having fun.
If getting his memories back means he'll give up manga again,
it might be better if he didn't
But then your father would never recognize you, Hime!
Hime, are you okay with that?
If you're okay with it, then
Sorry.
But still,
if you stop being okay with it, you can tell us.
Megurogawa Detective Agency is always accepting jobs!
And if there's anything I can do, tell me.
You're my savior, Hime.
Thanks.
I'm home.
Sorry I left you alone.
Your eyes again?
Is it bad?
Yeah.
Shouldn't we get it checked out?
I think so.
Day by day, I'm seeing less color.
Huh?
Judging from the exam results,
she can still faintly see colors,
but her color blindness could advance until she can't sense colors anymore.
She'll see the world in monochrome.
She could possibly lose all color vision
A monochrome world, huh?
That might be perfect for reading manga.
Well, in my job, we express all colors in black and white.
But for your job
I'll be fine. Most colors have associated numbers.
But, before all color left my life,
I wanted to see that blue one more time with my own two eyes.
What the three of us saw on that island.
That blue.
Go see it, then! I'll look after Hime.
I should be back by tomorrow night,
so watch the house with Daddy, okay, Hime?
Why'd I let her go?
You're still drawing?!
If he was this fast while it was still running, life would have been easier.
Wow, he really is picking right up from seven years ago.
He's basically already drawn this exact same story.
If he keeps doing a chapter of this every week,
he might remember in seven years.
Would it be such a bad idea to tell the truth?
They say it could backfire. He has to remember, himself.
Don't worry for our sake!
We're ready to work hard for him!
At least let us have Rasuna!
At least let us have Rasuna!
She's our best author right now!
For now, just put the next chapter on hold.
Goto really did love manga, after all.
He looks happiest when he's drawing.
It's been a long time since I saw him like that.
In Goto's case,
drawing manga might be the best rehab there is.
Everyone, a moment!
What now?!
What's up?
We're going to discuss future developments!
Without me?
U-Um
Everyone cares for you. They're good people.
Yeah, I guess so.
You look so happy when you're drawing manga, Goto.
Do I?
You've always hidden this job that you clearly enjoy so much
and then you had to leave it?
It must have hurt.
I'm sorry I never noticed
Even if you're like this forever
As long as you can draw manga,
this is what would make you happiest, right?
It's not.
My greatest joy would be
I'll be at my happiest
if Hime grows up big and strong.
If Hime grows up big and strong.
No way!
Your dad did?!
I have a favor to ask! Please, help me!
There's something I absolutely have to show Dad!
Watch it!
Dad Dad!
I'm sorry! I'm just a bad, selfish daughter!
I just
want to stay with you!
Sorry to call you out.
Hey, it's nothing.
It's been a while since the Megurogawa Detective Agency had a case!
Let's do this, girls!
Yeah!
I'm not gonna make it!
Alright, Goto. We're gonna head out.
We'll be back tomorrow!
Okay.
Excuse me!
What's this?
Hime!
What's all this stuff?
The Kamakura house manuscripts?!
Please, read this.
What is this?
I don't remember drawing this!
There's more!
Somehow we made it in time!
This one's great! It was worth sticking to it right up to the deadline!
Alright, Goto, I'm heading out.
Okay, I'm confirming receipt.
Oh, and last week's reader poll is in.
It was that littlest bit positive.
Goto, I'm sorry! I erased too hard and tore the page!
Good job at work today!
Goto, I think the ending for this one needs a little work.
Didn't we do this gag before?
I thought up a super-funny joke!
What if his golf club was a mushroom?
You're on fire today, Goto!
You're like a manga demon!
And with that said
Demons out!
You just wanted me to be the demon!
Okay, Daddy's the demon, so throw the beans as hard as you can.
But I can't throw them at you, Dad.
Come on, look at the camera and smile!
Huh? But that's embarrassing!
What are you saying? This is once-in-a-lifetime!
I'm a middle-schooler now.
We'll be living here starting today.
Though it's a bit shabby
That's fine.
Everywhere's great, as long as I'm with you.
Dad.
Dad!
Let's get along forever, Dad.
Dad, I'm 18 now.
Hi
Hime
Don't look!
Goto!
He's back!
Goto!
Thank goodness!
It's cliched, but!
This isn't good at all!
My dad was hiding that he drew for a living.
And finally, I have a secret, too.
And finally, I have a secret, too.
Come on, Hime
Draw that stuff at home!
No way! What are you saying?
What'll I do if Dad finds out?!
I think I'll keep it a secret for a while.
Even though it's not dirty jokes.
That's my secret.
Well? What do you think?
Every hit I make is one year's treatment fee.
I'm not gonna rely on that old geezer.
Was Imashigata the one who paid your fees?
He's not a bad guy, then.
Wait, dirty jokes again?!
Are you sure? What if Hime finds out?
Well, she's already an adult.
She won't mind.
How about drawing a manga about drawing manga?
Where an author hides his dirty joke manga from his kid!
Who'd read that crap?
It sounds fun to me!
We could use him as a model, too.
Nice idea, Tomaruin.
But this is my office, you know!
A lot's happened since then.
After that, Naru told me what she learned.
About Dad's kindness.
And the reason the Nakameguro and Kamakura houses were the same.
Before Mom went colorblind, in case she went fully blind,
he thought it'd be easier for her to live there if the house was the same.
Well, it's not like she asked Dad directly.
Oh, and one more thing.
There was a tracing paper with some mysterious codes in the age-19 box.
Cyan, magenta, yellow, key plate.
It was coded colors.
They were the colors Mom added to Dad's boring, colorless manga.
Memories are monochrome.
I'll add the color!
I'm home.
