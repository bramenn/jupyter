Geniuses are valuable because they help make the world more peaceful.
I won't let them fall into the hands of evil!
In the name of the moon, Sailor Moon will punish you.

I'm Usagi Tsukino, 14 years old. I'm in the 8th grade.
I'm clumsier than others and a bit of a crybaby. That's about it.
One day, a strange black cat, Luna, appeared
and gave me a peculiar transforming brooch and made me a sailor warrior.
But, she wants me to fight against bad guys.
That makes me really nervous.
Oh well, I guess everything will be okay.
Is the Genius Girl a Monster? Brainwashing School of Terror
Right now, the children of Japan are forced to study day after day
and they are suffering.
I have heard that there are more and more mothers
who are called academic moms who push their children mercilessly.
The parents are desperate to send their children
to the best kindergarten, the best primary school,
the best junior high school, the best high school
and the best college.
And? What about after graduating from the best college?
What do they do?
I am not quite certain.
I will leave it to you.
Yes, my lady. I will leave it to you.
Yes, my lady.
Girls 5
Usagi!
Oh, Mom. Look! This is so funny!
This is no time to be laughing.
How did you do on that mock exam?
Oh, that? The results are coming out tomorrow.
I can't believe you asked.
Usagi, I won't ask for the impossible.
But please, just don't fail.
No matter what, if there's a kid in first place,
there's always a kid in last place too!
It's not fair to yell at that kid just because her grades are bad!
You don't study, but you're always ready with an excuse.
I'm the one who wants to cry!
Good girl. It's about time you started studying.
Obviously, you don't care about me. It must be nice to be a cat.
What are you talking about?
Oh, I wish I could be a cat.
Maybe, you don't know, but I've got lots to do,
like finding the princess.
Oh, you're reading a comic book!
I wish you would put more effort into finding the princess too.
But...
Find the princess and fight against the enemy.
That is your fate and you can't escape it.
You can't do this to me!
Besides, who is this enemy anyway?
Something very evil that's not human.
I don't really get it.
To be honest, I don't really know who they are either.
Please try the Sailor V game.
Sailor V GAME Please try the Sailor V game.
Sailor V GAME Code name 0091. This is Luna.
My secret password is The rabbit on the moon makes rice cakes.
The moon rice cakes are sticky.
When I grilled them, they puffed up.
Have you found the princess?
Not yet. I still have no clue where she is.
I see.
Sailor Moon is not as dependable as I thought she would be.
I understand; do not grumble so.
Yes. By the way, I sensed a new and strange energy.
This is her.
It could be another monster sent by our enemy.
That's what I thought.
Investigate her quickly. That's what I thought.
Investigate her quickly.
Yes, I will.
National Mock Exam Ranking Results
National Mock Exam Ranking Results It's Ami Mizuno from Class 5 again!
National Mock Exam Ranking Results
As expected, Ami Mizuno's at the top of our class.
Not only that, she's the best in the country!
What?! The best in the country?
According to rumors...
Her IQ is supposedly 300.
Wow, she really is a genius.
Yes.
By the way, don't pop up suddenly from such weird places!
Oh, it's Miss Mizuno!
I heard she attends Crystal Cram School.
Hey, that's the new place they just built, right?
My mom told me that it's really expensive.
I heard that Miss Mizuno's mom is a doctor.
They're probably rich.
However, she's on a scholarship, so she's attending for free!
But she's got a bad attitude.
It's like she thinks she's better than everybody else.
Oh, I can't stand people like that.
It's such a nice day!
Yeah, it is! It's such a nice day!
Yeah, it is!
But, it must be nice to be so smart.
I always have to worry that Mom's going to kill me.
Usagi! It's about time you started going to a cram school!
No! No! Usagi! It's about time you started going to a cram school!
Usagi! It's about time you started going to a cram school!
Oh, Miss Mizuno.
A cat?
I sense a strange energy coming from this girl.
Oh, now's not the time!
You're so soft.
If only we didn't live in a high-rise apartment,
I could get a nice cat too.
Luna!
Sorry, are you okay?
Is that your cat?
Yeah.
Since she came from the sky, I thought she was an angel.
Luna an angel?
She's sweeter than I thought.
You're Miss Ami Mizuno from Class 5, right?
I'm Usagi Tsukino from Class 1. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
This cat's name is Luna.
Luna? It means moon, right?
You are a genius! You're the first to know that right away!
If I become friends with her, I can get her to help me study for exams.
Usagi.
She could be a monster sent by the enemy. So, be careful.
No way!
What's wrong? Laughing so suddenly?
Oh, it's nothing.
By the way, Miss Mizuno, do you play games?
No, I've never tried before.
Then let's play some. I'll teach you how to play.
And in exchange, when tests come up...
Don't worry, Luna. I think you're thinking too much.
Obviously, something's wrong with me today.
Miss Mizuno, do you want to try? It's fun.
But it looks difficult.
You're very observant! This game really is pretty hard.
So, you'd be doing good if you can score 500 points on your first try.
You're pretty good!
Really?
Wow! Amazing!
No way.
Wow, she got the highest score.
Huh? What? Oh, my...
Hi, Usagi. I didn't know you were here.
Yes!
Wow, she's amazing!
I know.
There goes my help on exams...
Oh, look at the time!
I'm sorry, Miss Tsukino, I have to go to cram school!
No, I'm the one who should apologize.
I didn't know you had cram school today.
I go everyday.
Everyday?
I don't have any talents other than studying.
Well, thank you. I'll see you again.
Bye!
I feel like we live in completely different worlds.
Usagi.
Yes!
By any chance...
Yes, what is it? By any chance...
Yes, what is it?
I think this belongs to your friend.
Oh, is that all?
Oh, nothing.
I'll make sure she gets it!
Crystal Cram School Ami Mizuno
Crystal Cram School
Crystal Cram School Stupid human beings.
Stupid human beings.
Keep studying and provide us with your brain energy.
Oh? My floppy's not here.
Did I drop it somewhere?
Oh, well. I don't use it much anyway.
Miss Mizuno.
Use the Crystal Disk and study hard.
You're on a scholarship, so you mustn't be lazy.
Yes, Ma'am.
I have high expectations of you.
I hate to say it, but that disk gives me a headache.
If you use our newly developed Crystal Disks,
even you can be a genius!
So, is this the Crystal Disk?
Usagi, be careful.
I'm just going to return this disk. You worry too much.
Are you finally in the mood to study a little, dumpling head?
You again!
Why do you always show up at the weirdest times?!
That's not my problem.
By the way, wasn't that cat just talking?
Are you kidding? Cats can't talk! You're so silly!
That was so close. It'd be big trouble if he found out.
Oh, I was in a hurry and forgot to return this.
It's all his fault!
Usagi, let's go to the computer lab at school.
Why?
I want to check out that disk.
You think this is suspicious?
I'll just warn you now. I don't know how to use a computer.
Luna, you are something!
Knowing how to use a computer is normal these days, Miss Usagi.
Oh, really?
Look! I thought so.
Oh, no! What is this sound?!
Offer the energy of your brain and knowledge to our great ruler,
and become our loyal followers.
This is a brainwashing program! And become our loyal followers.
It can't be!
So, she is a monster!
Crystal Cram School
Crystal Cram School I still can't believe it.
Crystal Cram School
But it's a fact! Get ready!
Okay.
Moon Power!
Turn me into a doctor who works at a university hospital!
I heard someone is sick here!
Everyone, get away from the computers right now!
Who are you?! Don't interrupt our studies!
So, you are a monster!
Huh? What are you talking about?
Don't play dumb!
Transform into Sailor Moon!
Moon Prism Power Makeup!
No way!
What?!
I am the monster of knowledge, Garoben!
This genius girl is going to sacrifice her brain energy
to our great ruler!
Which means Miss Mizuno isn't a monster after all!
That's weird.
Stop this, evil villain!
Geniuses are valuable because they help make the world more peaceful.
I won't let them fall into the hands of evil!
Sailor warrior of love and justice, Sailor Moon!
In the name of the moon, I will punish you.
Question number one!
Genius Newton question.
Why do apples fall from trees?
How should I know? Ask the apples, not me!
You idiot! If you don't know the answer, take this!
You idiot!
I know! Because a hurricane came!
Oh! Luna!
I can't believe you! It's because the Earth has gravity!
Because the Earth has gravity!
Then question number two!
What is gravity? Explain in less than 50 words!
That's impossible!
If you cannot answer, this is what happens.
What?! No way!
Come on, wait a minute!
Now is my chance!
Give up your genius brain energy!
It's not absorbing her energy.
Why is that?
You didn't use the Crystal Disk, did you?!
You should study on your own without using machines!
You impudent little...
What... What is this?!
That mark is...
I see! That strange energy was from a sailor warrior...
Then, I'll just take your brain instead!
Prepare yourself!
Ami!
Use this!
Say, Mercury Power Makeup!
Mercury Power Makeup!
So, Ami is the second sailor warrior, Sailor Mercury.
Ami?
Say, Bubble Spray!
Bubble
Spray!
What?!
Where did she go?
I'm getting cold.
What?
Shoot!
I have you now!
You fell for it!
Shoot!
Now, Sailor Moon!
Okay!
Moon Tiara Action!
Everyone, it's okay now!
Yes, you're the second sailor warrior, Sailor Mercury.
Sailor Mercury!
Sorry for mistaking you for a monster.
That's okay.
But it's reassuring to have you as one of us. Right, Luna?
Definitely.
Oh, thank you.
Especially when I need to get ready for tests.
Usagi.
Yes?
Once again, I'm glad to meet you.
Let's work together, so we can beat the bad guys!
Me too! I'm glad I met you!
She's such a tough girl, I think I might not be able to keep up.
