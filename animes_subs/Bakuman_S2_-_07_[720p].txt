Dream of life
Can you hear my heartbeat
Baby I trust you my friend
Mashiro, let's do our best.
I know you can draw without resting.
I believe in you.
Let's make our dreams come true.
Yeah.
I-I cant tell him to stop drawing.
Azuki.
Yes?
I'm all right now.
Oh, sorry.
T-Thanks.
Mashiro, Takagi.
I'll be frank.
The editorial department is going ahead with their plans to put you on hiatus with chapter 20 in issue 33.
That's...!
I won't go on hiatus.
Ever!
All right.
That's what I'll tell them when I get back to the office.
And I'll also tell them I think you can draw in the hospital.
Yes!
Please do!
Oh, it's already this late?
Saiko, don't push yourself too hard. Get some sleep, okay?
Yeah, I can't go to school, so I should be able to get some decent sleep.
Anyways, I think I can make a clean copy of the rest of chapter 20's storyboard by tomorrow.
No, you don't need to.
I can understand the story well enough from Takagi's version.
I'll work it out with Takagi and make sure you can get started on the manuscript by Saturday, as usual.
Let's head out, then.
But there's still a bit of time left, isn't there?
We might as well stay...
See ya.
Hey, whats with you?
Hurry, hurry.
Jeez, that Shujin.
He did something he didn't need to.
I'll come every day I can.
Why?
Because I'm worried... and I can't email you here.
Well, I can use my cell phone if I step outside the hospital...
I should be able to turn it on if I go out into the courtyard.
Everyone does it.
And I'll be fine. You don't need to worry so much.
It may contradict what I said before,
but being able to see you makes me happy.
Let's limit it to until you're released from the hospital.
Can I keep coming?
Does it bother you?
I might also be contradicting myself.
When I'm with you, I get embarrassed and my heart starts pounding...
but it also calms me down.
I feel like I want us to be together forever.
But only until I'm discharged.
Yeah.
Thanks. Get well soon!
I'm glad I got sick.
It seems like I'll have some good memories of being here with you.
Mashiro.
Does it bother you that we decided to stay apart until our dreams come true?
It's not like that.
I think it's hard sometimes,
and after I get discharged it'll be hard to go back to being apart from you,
but that's exactly why I can push myself.
I want to see you soon.
I want to be with you.
Yeah.
I understand.
Until our dreams come true.
I'm saying I think he can still draw! I don't want to force them to go on hiatus!
What are you saying, Miura?
Well, we can at least put the bit that the assistants finish up into issue 32.
Thank you!
However, I will still put out the hiatus announcement from issue 33 onwards.
B-But...
Are you telling me you received permission to let him draw from his doctor?
N-No...
I'll accompany you to the hospital tomorrow.
It seems I can't count on you to get the job done.
Yes sir...
The patient is saying that if he is not allowed to draw, his stress will increase, and it will be bad for his health.
It is true that patients should be allowed to do as they like in moderation.
Really?
Only in moderation.
I won't push myself.
How about it?
Ah, sorry to barge in, ma'am.
This is the editor-in-chief
It's been a while.
Thank you for taking care of my son.
You've met before?
It's not something I should mention here.
We are to blame for the current situation, and I offer my deepest apologies.
No, you aren't... Moritaka!
Stop drawing manga in your hospital room!
Ah, well, the doctor said it was fine in moderation...
He won't be able to do it in moderation!
Well, it isn't good to be too persistent.
I'll rest a bit.
Your name was Sasaki, correct?
I'd like to talk with you.
My husband said that he's not a child anymore, and to let him continue on the path he chose.
But I just can't...
Rest assured, we will not let any harm come to him.
Mr. Yoshida...
I think I should go visit Ashirogi in the hospital.
Where did you hear about that?
We tried to keep it quiet.
I won't reveal my source.
You'd dry it up, of course.
Even Niizuma won't pick up my calls anymore.
Anyways, I've barged into Ashirogi's before, and they took care of me.
It's only proper that I go visit them.
A manga author isn't a real member of society.
So cruel!
I'm not a member of society anymore?
I'm already a caged bird.
No, I'm Mr. Yoshida's pet dog.
I'm not allowed to act like a human anymore!
If I wasn't here, you'd look up his hospital and go anyways, right?
Let's just go on Monday and get it over with, then.
In exchange, I'll be going with you, and we're coming back right away.
All right?
I heard Mashiro is in the hospital.
Yeah, I heard from Aida.
I also heard that they're on hiatus starting from issue 33.
Going on hiatus after finally getting popular...
What bad luck.
It seems Niizuma already went to see him.
I'm going on Monday, wanna come?
I'm pushing it every week. I don't have that kind of time!
Come on, don't be so cold.
If I invite Miss Aoki, she'll be sure to come.
Aoki will?
No, no.
I'm really pushing my deadline.
Would you stop tempting me like that?
I'm worried about Mashiro, but I just can't...
Sorry. I'll just tell him you're concerned for him, too.
What? She did?
Yeah, and she even propped up Saiko with her own hands.
I thought they weren't even gonna hold hands until they got married.
What's she thinking?
You'd think she would stop him.
No, this showed me once again how much she really does like him.
Huh? I don't get it.
The ultimate love is accepting everything your partner wishes for, and helping to achieve it.
And perhaps cooperating with them as well.
But I would be too worried about his health and stop him.
Azuki's got a strong will.
And she really loves Saiko.
Well, it does take some strength to stay apart until their dreams come true.
They met, though.
Can they go back to staying apart now?
If they kiss in the hospital or something, I bet they won't be able to!
Kiss
Where are you going with that?
Whatever, you don't understand a woman's heart.
All right, the storyboard's done.
I'll give it to Saiko even if there's fixes to be made.
Back on track!
H-He's still drawing even though he's been hospitalized!
And his girlfriend is cute!
It's kind of tough to work in here, and it's a bit cramped, but I can't allow a break in our serialization.
Look well.
Isn't he the model manga author?
Yes...
Are you drawn to this kind of lifestyle, Miss Girlfriend?
Um, yes.
Mr. Yoshida, when we return, I will definitely draw.
I feel like I was mistaken...
Yes, you were.
You should feel ashamed of yourself, Hiramaru.
Oh, if it isn't the escape artist Hiramaru.
It's been a while.
Fukuda!
Hey!
He's the author of KIYOSHI Knights, Fukuda.
You met him earlier at Niizuma's house, right?
Oh!
Thanks for taking care of me then, Fukuda.
Kiyoshi's the best!
Please give me your contact information and the address of your office, if you would...
Hey!
You're not even really reading Jack, are you?
Seriously though, seeing you work while hospitalized has given me a better opinion of you, Mashiro.
I won't lose to you all.
We were just talking about him being a model manga author.
I laughed at the Wanted: Hiramaru fax from Yoshida.
Why are you laughing?
Well, I'm glad that you're lively enough to draw the manuscript.
It's pretty loud in here for a hospital room.
Chief Editor!
I apologize, but I must ask everyone but Mashiro and Takagi to leave the room.
Why do we have to leave?
Because this has nothing to do with you.
I think it does, though.
Ashirogi Muto are my comrades.
Comrades?
You're soft.
Of course, it's written as comrade but read as rival.
Fine, you may stay.
Azuki, you stay too.
Listen, this is a hospital. No matter what I say, don't make a fuss.
Is it something we'd make a fuss over?
Last night, we had a meeting regarding what to do with Detective TRAP.
Detective TRAP will be put on hiatus until next April, when the authors graduate from high school.
Next April?
What the hell is that? I don't get it!
I told you not to make a fuss.
I'm kind of jealous.
Why?
Why April instead of when he's discharged?!
Right, don't be ridiculous!
Miura, you told us it was fine to start this storyboard on Saturday!
I'm sorry...
What's the reason?
Please explain this to me!
He's right.
Let's hear it!
It's because Kawaguchi Tarou died.
The death of my uncle and our serialization have nothing in common.
Uncle?
Died?
There was someone I knew who worked too hard on manga and died.
The person he told me about, that was his...?
Kawaguchi Tarou was Mashiro's uncle on his father's side.
His death is firmly linked to his occupation as a manga author.
It wouldn't be a stretch to say that he was a victim of manga.
Your mother is worried and wants you to stop drawing manga entirely.
Of course she does.
No one wants to lose their family, the ones they love.
I won't rest.
I'll draw.
Kawaguchi Tarou never broke a serialization deadline even once.
Even when he had a fever above 104...
Even when he strained his back and couldn't sit up,
he drew his manuscript while lying down.
He never went on hiatus even once.
He said he was proud of that, at least.
That is an old-fashioned way of thinking, but it's respectable that you don't want a hiatus.
But when the editorial department decides you need rest, then you must rest.
I don't need rest!
Let me be clear.
Continuing to draw would trouble all of us.
That's...
Get better first.
Even after he gets better, he's still on hiatus until April.
That's right.
Aren't you contradicting yourself by telling him to get better, then not picking the serialization back up?
The genius high schooler Niizuma Eiji.
We were impressed with his performance in serialization, so the editorial board approved serializing authors in high school.
But a weekly serialization isn't that easy.
It was our mistake.
We regret it, and will refrain from approving such serializations in the future.
Refrain?!
But serializations that have already started should be another matter!
You're irresponsible for starting this policy now!
Then I'll quit school!
Me too!
There shouldn't be a problem then!
Even if you do that, I won't lift the hiatus until April!
What Ashirogi's saying makes more sense!
Put yourself in their parents' positions!
Dropping out of high school to draw manga.
Will your parents be happy with that?
I don't live for my parents!
That's right! Our lives are our own!
Until April?!
A special Sunday meeting was held yesterday, and that's what was decided upon.
Why until April?
Isn't that strange?
I was interested as well, so I asked the vice-editor, but all he said was It'll be a problem if he dies on us.
Aida, do you know who Kawaguchi Tarou was?
Of course.
He was the one-hit-wonder who made Super Hero Legend.
He didn't want to end his career with just that, so he continued writing storyboards and eventually died from overwork.
That's just a rumor, right?
No, apparently, it's the truth.
What?
His real name was Mashiro Nobuhiro.
He was none other than Mashiro's uncle.
I see.
I guess they had no choice, then.
That's messed up.
Yuujirou!
He's not allowed to draw until April because he's Kawaguchi Tarou's relative?
That's unbelievable!
I think so too.
We're ignoring Mashiro's... no, Ashirogi Muto's feelings!
If Kawaguchi Tarou wasn't my uncle...
you wouldn't be doing this.
Right?
That is correct.
That's awful.
What's with that lame excuse?
I can't listen to this!
Hiramaru!
Where are you going?
Where? Where else would I go but back to my room to draw manga?
It's like he said.
This doesn't make sense.
Miura, this is your fault, too, you yes-man.
Good job.
This is not Miura's fault.
On the contrary, he resisted until the very end.
This is my decision.
I won't accept this hiatus until April bull.
See you all later, Ashirogi.
I'll say it again.
Even if you draw, I won't publish it until April.
But if you regain your health and graduate high school, I promise to restart the serialization then.
Miura, I'm headed back.
I'll stay.
I see.
Dammit!
What's with this April thing?!
Takagi, Mashiro, I'm so sorry!
It's as you saw I have no authority.
I couldn't do anything.
Miura.
I'm the one who needs to apologize.
To you, Shujin... and Azuki too.
If I hadn't gotten sick...
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault!
It's the chief editor's decision!
Yes, and it's also due to my powerlessness.
You don't need to apologize to me.
The words I said to you the day we graduated middle school... will hold true forever.
Take your time to get better.
What's this about graduation day?
Well, even if I ask, you probably won't tell me.
I said I'd always be waiting.
A-Azuki...
So she is worried about his health.
I'll always be waiting, huh.
Certainly,
I won't forgive the chief editor for putting Ashirogi in that situation.
Right?
Yes, it's irrational.
I won't draw for Jack until he withdraws his decision.
Wow!
But if I'm the only one doing that, it won't make a big impact.
All right.
If they're making TRAP take a break, then I'll take a break too!
But won't Ashirogi feel guilty about that?
That's why we're going to keep this quiet from them,
and only tell them after the editor withdraws his decision.
I see.
I'll convince Nakai and Aoki.
Oh! The entire Fukuda Team will boycott!
That's awesome!
That's not all.
Boycott!
It's wonderful, it's fun, and tomorrow just got a bit brighter.
April is just too long.
We've got no choice.
We're talking about a person's life here!
Like I said, please tell us about yesterday's meeting in more detail!
Hey, Yuujirou, cut it out.
Why are you stopping me?
I just can't go along with it this time!
Right, I feel bad for Ashirogi!
The Chief Editor is back!
B-Boycott?
We won't draw Kiyoshi, CROW, or Otters 11 until he withdraws his decision.
No objection.
And if he doesn't give in, I'll draw for another magazine until Ashirogi can draw again.
You're going that far?
But you have a contract, so you can't do that...
I'll return the down payment and do it!
If it comes down to it, I'll pay the termination fees for Ashirogi and everyone else so we can migrate to another magazine!
I want to keep drawing manga, you know.
But, well...
Nakai, you're not manly enough at times like these.
I feel that the Chief Editor is going too far.
We should fight against it.
Oh, Miss Aoki, this is the first time we've agreed on something.
For a boycott, the more people we have, the better.
You're on fire today!
I also like you.
H-Hey, Hiramaru!
What are you trying to pull in this confusion?
Forgive me.
You see, I'm weak against beautiful women.
Fine, I'll do it.
I'm worried about them, too.
I'm in.
I'm back.
Hey.
It's too quiet in here.
We heard about Ashirogi.
Yeah.
It's awful.
We can't just keep quiet about this.
Let's protest it.
Hey, the Chief Editor is just outside.
Keep it down.
And even if you protest, there's no way he'd change his mind once it's made up.
Fukuda?
Boycott?
What do you mean by that?
If arrangements are not made for TRAP's early return, we will also go on hiatus.
We...?
KIYOSHI Knights, CROW, Otters 11 ...
Otters as well?
And also, hideout door.
Hi-door too?
They each took the phone and announced it.
That's five series counting TRAP.
It'll be a huge problem if they all go on hiatus!
Hey, where are you going?
Since they've gone out of their way to tell us about the boycott, I'm going to let the Chief Editor know.
Don't, idiot!
It's the editors' job to make the authors draw!
We can't just accept it quietly!
Yuujirou, everyone was on the same phone, right?
Yeah.
Which means they're all in the same place right now.
I'll go. Try asking them where they are.
I'll go, too.
I'm in charge of Fukuda and Niizuma.
This is a problem regarding TRAP, so I'll come too.
I'm coming too.
Listen, when we leave the department, let's go in ones and twos so we don't raise suspicion.
Yeah. At the nearest family restaurant. There are five of us here.
All of our editors, plus Hattori, are coming in secret without the Chief Editor knowing.
They're taking us on!
It's a battle between authors and editors!
Oh! EXCITING!
We're boycotting until the decision about Ashirogi's hiatus is reversed!
It seems like an unprecedented situation will occur.
It's unprecedented that you and I agree on something!
Recall and Call.
I won't forgive a guy who crushes dreams!

The fight doesn't end until I fulfill my dream
I wonder how far I've come now?
In ten years, I'll be living the dream
It's the scenario I wrote for myself, so I'll have no regrets
But life isn't that easy, and it's full of obstacles
Still, I swear to myself that I won't ever back down
I have a dream that I absolutely want to achieve
So I fuel my passion until I succeed
There will be meetings and partings along the way
But I'll simply believe in my strength that you've taught me
And rise back up again and again and again

In this world, every day is dull and full of nonsense
I cover my ears, trying to mute the noise
Why do people hurt each other?
In the contradictory, overlapping shadows
on the recesses of my heart, fallen into despair
While carrying this pain in my chest,
can I really dream of tomorrow?
can I really dream of tomorrow?
Remembering the rainbow I found after the rain,
