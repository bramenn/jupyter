In those hectic days when we barely had time to sleep,
I had not realized the flaw in my plan.
Yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, keep going on
Baby I'm standing alone
An unforgettable rainy day
Chasing after your shadow
And it's over, it's like sand now
I sigh every night
I scream like a child and cried
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow
Please, please God, forgive my sins
I don't need to hide no more
Flowing toward the turquoise light
Just keep going on
You've got the chance now
You've got the power
Know you gotta be so true to yourself
I show you my life now
I show you my love now
I show you my everything yeah yeah
You'd better change now You'd better catch now
Don't ever change so be yourself
I'll show you my strength now
I'll show you my love now
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah
Baby don't be afraid
Yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, keep going on
Yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, keep going on
So, what do you wanna do when we get there?
We've gotta try out some real Italian cuisine first.
Hey listen. I looked up some stores.
Hey, isn't he from Trapnest?!
- Huh? Who? - Ren?
No, the long-haired one.
Really? Where?
So where's Ren?
I'm sick of eating bread for breakfast every day.
I want some miso soup.
Oh, I found this great Japanese restaurant.
Wanna go there tonight?
I want some of Nana's salty miso soup!
Ren, keep your voice down.
Ren, you're better off forgetting about women like that.
Women like that?
While we're on the subject, I'll be blunt with you.
I believe Nana is the type of girl she's rumored to be
and you're really being fooled by her.
If she loved you,
she'd be more careful about the salt content in her cooking...
Take, let me go back to Japan earlier too.
That's not fair just Takumi got to go.
No, you still have your photo shoot. Besides, he had his reasons.
What? Takumi's returning early?
He's already left. Yesterday.
What's with that?! Why didn't he say anything about it?!
He should've arrived in Japan by now.
He's so cold...
Mom, I'm off to check in at the hotel.
If Mr. Ichinose's coming to see us tomorrow anyway,
he should've stayed over.
But he'll be arriving pretty late,
so he didn't wanna inconvenience anyone.
He shouldn't be so formal. He's gonna be family.
They're seeing each other for the first time in half a month.
Of course they want some time alone.
Oh, I guess you're right.
I'm sure looking forward to tomorrow.
Talking with him over the phone, Takumi seems like a really nice person.
Huh? When did you talk to him?
I answered the phone when he called from overseas.
Dad is prejudiced when it comes to celebrities
saying they're as bad as the yakuza
but even he was praising Takumi on his manners.
Really?
But he is like a yakuza though.
HE'S GOT YOU FOOLED.
HE'S GOT YOU FOOLED. Is that so?
HE'S GOT YOU FOOLED.
HE'S GOT YOU FOOLED. If he actually was a gangster, he'd take over the world.
If he actually was a gangster, he'd take over the world.
He's so cutthroat.
Then God must've given him musical talent
to keep him on the right path in life.
The world of entertainment seems glamorous,
but I'm sure it's pretty difficult.
It will be your job to create a home where he can relax.
So stop slacking off and do your best.
Mhm.
By the way, how's Nana doing? Have you been keeping in touch?
No. I hear that Nana broke her cell phone.
So I haven't been able to call or email her.
And she hasn't called me.
I see. That's a bit worrisome, isn't it?
Yeah. But from what my other friends are telling me,
she seems to be in extremely high spirits and working hard.
Extremely?
That's my Nana!
She's a tough girl!
I was so frantic to give Hachi the chance to see me out there singing.
It never occurred to me to ask how she was doing.
About her child, or about Takumi...
Honestly speaking, I didn't want to know.
Although that was just me being jealous.
You haven't even touched your breakfast. Are you feeling sick?
No...
Hey, Mari. I wonder if Takumi met up with Stella.
Huh? I-I don't know.
But we've been so busy, I doubt he had time to sleep around.
He raced through his schedule for his fiancee, after all.
That's awful.
Huh?
Well, that might be okay for his fiancee,
but Stella has been Takumi's lover for a lot longer!
Ah, is that so?
She might've even been secretly dreaming of marrying Takumi some day.
I feel sorry for Stella.
SUBJECT: IT'S ME, SHIN
You sure are amazing, Reira.
Huh?
To be able to see things from so many different perspectives like that.
I was only thinking of the feelings of Takumi's fiancee.
Someone who can sing songs
that captivate the general public sure is different.
You overestimate me, Mari.
It's just a matter of whose feelings I can empathize with more.
I'm a selfish person who only thinks of herself.
I have no idea how Stella really feels at all.
IT'S ME, SHIN. HOW ARE YOU, REIRA? ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH REST IN LONDON? RIGHT NOW, I'M RECORDING AT A TRAINING CAMP (WHAT THE HELL?) DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS UP NORTH.
IT'S ME, SHIN. HOW ARE YOU, REIRA? ARE YOU GETTING ENOUGH REST IN LONDON? RIGHT NOW, I'M RECORDING AT A TRAINING CAMP (WHAT THE HELL?) DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS UP NORTH. How are you, Reira? Are you getting enough rest in London?

It's salty!
Huh?
You're the one who said you wanted miso soup!
Stop complaining and eat it!
Why is everything you cook always so salty?
Misato should've come along to this camp.
Then she could've cooked for us.
No, we couldn't do that.
She should quit school and become our manager.
- Great idea! - She's very considerate.
That's true. In any case, I wanted a cute girl for a manager.
Yasu!
Are you not satisfied with me?
GINPEl MOROBOSHI (28) MANAGER Are you not satisfied with me?
- Not satisfied at all. - Not satisfied at all.
What was that?!
Ginpei! You're a man, so talk like one!
And we don't need two baldies!
Who are you to talk?! You're a girl, so talk like one!
And my head's not bald, it's just shaved!
Well, I'm not naturally bald either...
Oh! Smells good in here.
Ah, Matsuo! If you haven't eaten, would you care to join us?
- I'll pass. - Eat it.
I've decided to eat with the staff when it's Nana's turn to cook.
That's why your wife left you, Matsuo.
Anyway, Mr. Kawano will be arriving soon,
so we're gonna skip practice and have a meeting instead.
Come to the studio's conference room when you're done eating.
Man, it's cold! What's with this?!
This is crazy. It's still September.
What happened to global warming?
What's global warming?
Read the newspaper.

Guerrilla live performances?
Yeah. Five locations in Tokyo, starting on the tenth of next month.
Shinjuku, Yoyogi, Ikebukuro, Ueno, and Shibuya.
We'll be setting up a special stage in spots with lots of pedestrian traffic.
Yay! Live performances!
But won't we get in trouble with the police?
No. Of course we've obtained permits for the locations.
We're just not announcing to the public
that we'll be having these live performances.
I'm sure you're sick of dealing with the cops, right, leader?
So, our audience is the street pedestrians.
But we'll have twenty part-time paid applauders.
We don't need your hired applauders!
Oh no, you must have applauders.
Japanese crowds are so hard to get fired up.
You stop talking!
Just think of them as barkers for when a new store opens.
It's just a way to draw customers.
Oh...
Oh my! So you'll obediently listen to what Yasu says.
You aren't actually with him, are you?
SORE LOSER You aren't actually with him, are you?
I'll kill you, shaved-head!
Oh, bring it on!
- Wow, that's amazing, Ginpei! - S-Sorry...
That's okay, as long as you understand.

Hey Ren, has Naoki told you about Yasu?
What's that baldy up to?
I guess Search published an expose about him.
Naoki says there are rumors about it all over the internet.
An expose about what?
All kinds of things.
Apparently he hit a Search reporter to protect his vocalist,
and was taken in for questioning by the police.
Then, other magazines started saying
that Nana and Yasu are actually dating and things like that.
That's just not possible. It's all lies.
In addition, Search also wrote that Yasu's not a real lawyer
since he doesn't have a license to practice law.
Isn't that horrible?
That is horrible.
Um, Reira...
Oh, thank you.
You know, I've been concerned about those rumors too.
Is it possible Mr. Takagi never served as a law apprentice for a firm?
What's a law apprentice?
It would be equivalent to a medical intern.
After passing the bar exam,
you must serve as a law apprentice for a year and a half
before you can become a real lawyer.
You really know a lot, Mari!
More like you don't know anything.
What about you?!
Well, it's not exactly common knowledge.
I'm a law school graduate.
That's amazing! You're not just wearing those glasses for show.
No, there's nothing amazing about it.
And these glasses are just for show.
Then what are you doing being Reira's babysitter?
What do you mean, babysitter?!
You know, like changing your diapers...
She doesn't!
Enough about me.
No.
I wanna know more about you. Are you free tonight?
Why do all our members try to seduce every woman they see?!
Are you Italian?!
Anyway, so that's why Yasu said he was a trainee.
So I guess he's in the midst of his so-called apprenticeship.
But it's been a year and a half since he graduated,
so he could already be a lawyer!
No, once you become an apprentice,
you must go where you've been assigned.
He would've had no say as to where he'd be assigned.
If he were devoted to the band, it would've been difficult.
His mentor probably saw Mr. Takagi's abilities
and hired him through the office and had him do only desk work.
Mari, can you come here?!
Yes!
Mr. Takagi probably couldn't give up his dreams for the band.
The fact that he hit that reporter shows just how much he cares for his band members.
No matter what the public says,
I think Reira's boyfriend is a wonderful man.
Don't pay attention to the rumors, and keep your spirits high.
Mari?
Yes!
Boyfriend?
What does that mean? Wasn't Yasu's dream to be a lawyer?
It's always been secrets and lies.
Since the old days, I never knew what he was thinking.
I have no intention of making a living on music,
and I don't plan on ever leaving this town.
So I guess there's nothing we can do about it.
If the band is that important to him,
was that just an excuse to break up with me?
No, he didn't go that far for the sake of the band.
This may be a problem.
I could no longer sacrifice that much for Nana.
I wonder why.
I still love her like I always have.
Hey, Ren. If I died, would you die with me?
When did I become such a cold person?
REIRA, IF YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE LONELY NOW, I'D FLY TO LONDON IN A HEARTBEAT. I'D GO ANYWHERE.
REIRA, IF YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE LONELY NOW, I'D FLY TO LONDON IN A HEARTBEAT. I'D GO ANYWHERE. Reira. If you said that you were lonely now,

That's different from being a cold person, Ren.
The longer we live, the more weight we carry on our shoulders.
And it gets harder to do what you want...
That's why you need someone to carry that load with you.
Don't you think you and your girlfriend could do that for each other?
I'm really exhausted.
Souvenirs!
So many!
- Which do you want? - Just one out of seven?!
How about this one!
You've got a great nose.
- You picked the diamond... - Huh?!
earrings. That's a good choice.
- No, I'd rather have this one! - That's some tea.
- What about this? - A pearl necklace.
Wristwatch.
Shoes. A handbag. Cashmere scarf.
Where's the ring?!
Well, that's different from a souvenir. You already have it.
Your left pocket.
A magic trick?
It's that tendency to let your guard down that let's men trick you.
I do have a list of priorities that I cannot change.
First is work.
That makes up for more than ninety percent of my brain.
Everything else doesn't matter as much.
But I'd say my girl comes second. I need her so I can relax.
I won't be able to care for you too much,
but I won't let you have a hard life.
Okay.
As long as I'm your number one second priority.
I'm sorry but you're number two in my second priority.
Huh?!
Maybe this souvenir would best suit my number one woman.
Shoes?
They wouldn't fit you anyway.
She must be petite.
Sachiko...
TRAUMA
TRAUMA Is it you again?
You've already given her a name? And what a traditional name.
Well, whatever name's fine with me.
Here! Then these are for our lil' Sachiko.
They're so cute! Thank you, Daddy!
So many!
But doesn't that sound awkward? Sachiko Ichinose.
It's like a tongue twister.
Stop it with that ominous name.
You gave her that name!

Oh, Mr. Illegal Lawyer.
What are you working on, hiding in the dark?
Same goes for you.
You shouldn't be walking outside alone in the middle of the night.
It's dangerous.
It's all because that raccoon told us about the guerrilla live performances.
I got too excited to sleep.
Sleep while you have the chance.
Once we get back to Tokyo, we'll be really busy promoting our music.
Wanna sleep with me?
Sure. Why not.
That was a joke.
That wasn't funny.
Because you're in love with me.
You're right.
Now that I've laid all my cards on the table,
there's no point in denying it.
Was I too obvious?
You're damn right, baldy. What in the world are you up to?
I'm not really up to anything,
so you stop worrying and just focus on singing.
But, Yasu.
Ever since Ren and I broke up back home two and a half years ago,
I've felt closer to you than to Ren.
Even when I'm with Ren, I'm still feeling a bit lonely.
He and I can no longer become one like we used to.
Why is that? I still love Ren like I always have.
Mai, Yui, Sumire, Akane.
Names using only a single kanji character are best!
And it looks prettier with the last name,
which uses three kanji characters. Like Takumi.
What's wrong with Sachiko?
No way! Come on and help me think!
But I'm already kind of attached to it.
It's decided, the name's Sachiko!
Hey, Hachi. With stardust spread all across,
the night sky looks awfully bright tonight too.
Even now, when I see something sparkling,
it reminds me of Ren.
I reached into the sky
But I couldn't reach what I wanted
They grew smaller and disappeared into the sky
Like colorful balloons
I'm alone
My hand had no place to go
And gently you took it
Starless night
I won't look back at the shadow of my past
I want to feel your warmth
Tears are falling down
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go
Of your hand holding mine
