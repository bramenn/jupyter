Never forgive...
Never forgive...
I am the leader of the 7 Kin of Purgatory, Ultear!
Bring it on, rotten daughter!
I'm gonna teach you a lesson in your mother's place!
Ultear!
Don't worry about me!
Hurry and take Zeref to the evacuation area.
Right!
Juvia, wake up!
Gray-sama's voice!
Ah, to be awakened by Gray-sama's voice...
In whose sheets does Juvia awaken this morning?
Hey!
The Power of Life
Juvia, chase after them!
Don't let them have Zeref!
As you wish!
L-Leg is...
Juvia!
Okay! Understood!
If it's your order, Gray-sama...
I'm counting on you, Juvia.
Ice Make Lance!
Advance that ice's time to the future!
Vaporize!
Time Ark?
Right.
It doesn't work on humans, but I heard it's a Lost Magic that can manipulate time at will.
Gray might be fighting her at the moment...
Ice Maker Magic wouldn't...
Aye... That's gonna be a tough match-up.
Even Natsu was totally beat up.
No, I wasn't!
And besides, even if Gray ran into that cross-dressing geezer,
we don't have time to go saving him.
Not like I wanna, either.
Why?
If it were me, I'd beat'em by myself, no matter what.
I wouldn't want anyone gettin' in the way.
Man, what a long friendship... Totally in sync...
It's like you can tell what the other's thinking...
That ain't it!
Um, what about a cross-dressing geezer?
He was a geezer when I met him on Galuna Island...
Man, what a shock!
Wait, wasn't the old man the disguise?
No. I definitely get a young Master Bob feel to the guy.
Definitely a guy!
Man, I feel sorry for Gray.
You're gonna get killed the next time you run into the guy.
What exactly are you doing?
A pitfall, Princess.
For when the enemy is in pursuit.
Um, not that... Why are you in a swimsuit?
It is raining.
And also, it is fanservice.
For who?
Um, I was thinking...
Is this really the time for us to be chatting so casually?
You're not one to talk!
Attack and defend... Two teams...
Guess it's time to decide.
So let's get back to business already, Lucy.
Are you saying this is my fault?
Punishment time, yes?
Go back!
Ice Make Hammer!
To the future!
Damn it...
Ice Magic doesn't work?
Of course not!
I learned Time Ark in order to kill Maker Magic wizards like my mother.
In order... to kill Ul?!
I hated her for so long...
It's no use!
Flash Forward!
Ul cared for you!
So?
It's sad she can't show those feelings anymore!
If you can't use ice, you'll go hand-to-hand?
I'll beat you with ice.
I will beat you with Ul's magic!
My magic, Time Ark, can manipulate the time of objects.
Move ice to its future and it vaporizes.
Move ice to its past, and it becomes water.
I believe in Ul's Maker Magic.
Ice cannot defeat me.
Maker Magic won't be of any use at all!
Ice isn't going to work!
I can't...
But, how?
You shouldn't be able to manipulate the time of living things...
Red ice... Don't tell me...
He froze his own blood?!
Ice Blade: Seven Strike Dance!
Cutting the flesh, breaking off the bones...
What persistence...
But...
But...
I cannot lose!
That pose...
Not until I've gone to the World of Great Magic!
Rozen Krone!
It's the exact same Maker Magic as Ul!
Maker Magic is magic that's free.
For each and every person, it takes a different form.
Find your own form...
If you do, then you can be as strong as anything...
I never thought... I would be able to see it again.
Ul's magic...
Well, I suppose so...
The same blood runs in them, after all...
Silence!
Why, you...
What?
Why have you become like this? Why?!
Shut up!
You couldn't even hope to understand!
I was...
Mom... Where are we going?
Mom?
Mom?
I was abandoned by my mother.
Ultear-sama, we have come to pick you up.
And, the place I was sent...
Where's my mom?
Your mother has gone home.
Your mother requested that we strengthen your magic.
Where is this?
This is the the Bureau of Magic Development.
It's a wonderful facility that invents a range of new magic.
Now, please go into your room.
But...
Until your magic is strengthened, you cannot see your mother.
That's what she requested.
A change of clothes is prepared for you inside.
We will call for you soon.
Mom...
Why? Why did you...
I wanna go home!
Ultear-sama...
It is time.
What?
What are you doing?
This is scary!
We are strengthening your magic.
It may hurt a little. Please bear with us.
Think of it as for your mother's sake!
Mom!
It is time.
No... I won't go...
It is time.
How goes it?
She is quite the vessel.
We cannot even compare her to the other test subjects.
As I thought.
She is the daughter of Ul,
who is said to be near the level of one of the 10 Great Wizard Saints...
Increase the level by a factor of 5.
Inject the magic power for one hour.
Do not rest.
Yes, sir.
I wanna go home...
Hurry, come and get me...
Mom!
Mom!!
Test subject 3373 is escaping!
We've detected an extreme rise in magic power!
What do you think?
Leave her be for now.
Let's see what happens, daughter of Ul...
Mom!
Mom!
My mind and heart were in tatters
after being subjected to magic power enhancing experiments again and again...
I continued running, only wishing to see my mother...
But... what I saw there...
She abandoned me, and started living a happy life with different children...
Never forgive...
I returned to the Bureau of Magic Development as a test subject.
In order to get magic power, and get revenge on my mother...
Never forgive...
Never forgive...
What is the matter?
Well...
The past few days, her magic power has increased abnormally rapidly.
We think going any further may be dangerous...
I see. Interesting.
I thought she could be a candidate for one of the five, but...
The nature of her magic is different.
Performing a Body Link with her and myself may be impossible.
Raise the level to the maximum.
But, there is danger of an explosion...
I do not care.
I have obtained all the magic I require.
I have no more need for this place.
I will leave Ul's daughter as a parting gift for them.
He disappeared...
Hey, we've got trouble!
The magic power is flowing in reverse!
It's gonna explode!
Evacuate!
Evacuate!
Before long, I came to learn of the existence of Zeref,
and a Dark Guild who was after him...
When Zeref is resurrected once again,
the World of Great Magic will be complete.
World of Great Magic?
There, all magic can be used freely...
There is even magic that will allow you to get back happiness which was lost.
Magic to get back lost happiness?
Time Ark.
I will train you to use it.
In this world, Time Ark cannot be said to be complete.
It is an ancient Lost Magic which has been forgotten...
But, in the World of Great Magic, Time Ark will be complete.
You can can become someone who voyages through time...
In order to do it all again...
To change this accursed life to one of happiness...
I will complete the World of Great Magic!
Please, save her!
What was that voice?
Save her, please!
Again?
Her magic power has been too great ever since she was born!
These are... my mother's memories?
The magic power is concentrated in her tiny body,
and her fever won't go down!
If that's the case, there's a special facility...
My mother's memories...
Why is something like that...
My mother, who melted on Galuna Island and flowed into the sea...
The sea?
This is... inside my mother?
Dead?
What do you mean, she's dead?
Why?
What in the world happened?
She's dead, and that's all.
You were supposed to cure her!
I heard you specialized in this...
And yet...
We apologize, but her magic power was just too strong.
It was beyond our ability to cope with.
It's better for you not to see the body.
But...
Wait!
Give me back my daughter!
Give Ultear back to me!
It's different...
It's different than what I remember...
Ice Make Gungnir!
I heard Ul speak about you, once.
When she was born, I felt like a light had flown into my heart...
My dreams were filled with her bright future...
I was... so very happy.
The infinite possible futures her tiny body held...
The power of life...
My overflowing tears just wouldn't stop.
I wanted to go to the World of Great Magic,
and go back to who I was before I hated my mother...
She was the proof of my life.
My tear.
I just wanted to see you once again, Mom...
My battle is over.
My battle ain't over yet.
You can't beat Hades.
Doesn't seem like it.
Not gonna be possible on my own.
The weather seems like it's getting worse...
It's just settin' the stage for a thrilling climax!
I'm gettin' fired up!
If it keeps raining like this, won't that halve your power, Natsu?
Ooh, that's definitely gonna be a problem...
Hey! You sayin' some rain's gonna put out my flames?
That delayed reaction... We don't do that style gag much.
Next time: Thunder Roar!
And wait, it's time for the boss fight, not some comedy routine!
So you're aware this is just a routine?
Yeah, and I wish I wasn't!
