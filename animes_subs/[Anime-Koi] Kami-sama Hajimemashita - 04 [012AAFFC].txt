The Deity hh is Kidnapped
The Deity hh is Kidnapped
We'll be back soon!
We're back!
Rain.
It's been raining a lot.
Yo, look at that! A snake!
A snake?
A snake.
It's a white snake!
Awesome! Let's catch it!
Two minutes into the episode, and there's already a snake in the school.
Maybe it'll be the new school mascot.
Stop.
White snakes are the familiars of deities, you know.
You'll get cursed.
You touched it!
Now make sure you don't wander in again.
Momozono, your arm okay?
I'm fine. It didn't bite me or anything.
You sure? Look at your arm. It's all red.
What a strange mark, indeed!
Where's Tomoe?
He is currently preparing dinner.
I don't like shitake mushrooms, you know.
If you'd stop being picky, you might be able to do something with your talisman for once.
Nanami, where did you get this mark?
Oh, it looks like a reaction to the snake I picked up at school.
This is a special mark for a snake.
Special?
To be specific, this is the mark of the betrothed.
Huh? Betrothed?
Do you mind explaining how you got to be so friendly with a snake at school?
So, a white snake wandered into the school, and you rescued it because the kids were messing with it?
It was all white and pretty!
That's great! Now that white and pretty snake will be here to pick you up soon.
That pretty snakeis coming to pick me up?!
That snake got its saliva on you because you're such an airhead!
You can relax, though.
No matter who shows up, I won't let anyone lay so much as a finger on you.
Huh?
It'd bring shame upon my name if I let a stupid snake steal my master.
Still, this one being a white snake complicates things.
What did I do to deserve this?
Are you sure you can pass as a high-schooler?
Yes, I'm sure.
I stayed up all night studying this.
He's a lost cause.
For crying out loud, you cause nothing but trouble.
I'm not scared of snakes, you know.
For the time being, don't leave my sight while we're at school.
Not even for a second.
Mm-hm.
This is Mikage Tomoe, transferring in from Mikageyama.
Let's see. Your seat will be...
I'll take that one.
Excuse me?
Huh?
Tomoe and I... are classmates?
I wasn't expecting this turn of events.
Where's the crow?
It seems he's busy with work this week.
Normally, the classroom is quieter without Kurama, but now these girls...
Wow, he's so hot!
Hey, your name's Tomoe, right?
Didn't you bring lunch for Momozono once?
That really threw me for a loop!
It's been a while. Do you remember us?
We were in the classroom back then!
Of course he doesn't remember you.
I do remember.
Huh?
Umibe Natsuko, Tobita Megumi, and Hitami Chie.
I know the names and faces of each and every one of you.
You help out Nanami, after all. It's only natural.
H-How do you and Nanami know each other again?
Nanami is my master.
This isn't fair! If he doesn't stop saying that...
What's wrong?
Restroom?
No!
Good grief...
Stop using words like master and servant. You might cause a misunderstanding!
Servant?
They're going to call me names again!
Listen, this is our story.
You're the son of the family that's taken me in, okay?
Momozono-san!
And...
Huh?
The teacher told me to give the logs to you.
Here.
Thanks!
Good luck on your shift!
See ya.
D-Did she hear us?
Are you friends with her?
That's only the second time I've talked to her.
Momozono-san's a pretty interesting person.
She surprised me last time,
but I hope we can be friends.
Hmm.
This is strange.
I don't think I've ever been this close to Tomoe before.
It feels like we're closer now than when we were at the shrine.
All right, my job's done.
Sorry I took so long, Tomoe.
Let's take this to the office and head home.
I guess he's tired.
I hope he'll stay tomorrow, the day after that, and every day after that too.
Nanami-san.
Eh?
Good day.
Nice weather, isn't it?
I'd completely forgotten about what happened.
Nanami?!
Yonomori-sama, please look.
The plums have started budding.
Don't you have someone you'd like to view the flowers with, Mizuki?
Of course not.
If you do find someone like that, don't wait to tell me.
Oh, there he is!
Tomoe-kun, are you going home?
Would you like to
Go find...
Nanami right now!
You damn snake, I'll roast you over a spit when I find you!
Is she awake?
Not yet.
Oh, she woke up.
Hey human, wanna eat a centipede?
Good morning, Nanami-san.
Thanks for saving me at school the other day.
You're that guy that was at school!
I'm the shrine familiar of Yonomori Shrine.
I am known as Suenagaku Mizuki.
Suenagaku?
Rejoice!
Japan's best shrine familiar, Mizuki-dono, has chosen a bride!
This calls for celebration!
Wait, don't continue the story without me!
These two are the shrine's sprites.
The one enshrined behind you is the shrine's deity,
Yonomori-sama.
A deity?
Yonomori-sama's has given her blessing for our marriage as well.
Now, Nanami-san...
No.
I will not marry you.
But that ring around your arm is like an engagement ring.
I'm leaving!
Leave, then.
That is, if you can.
What's their problem?!
I'm getting out of here!
There's no way I'd stick around.
See? That was easy. No problem!
All right! I don't know my exact location, but if I stick to one path,
I should hit a highway or something eventually.
Definitely!
I'm getting out of here!
I am going to get out of here!
There's someone there!
People!
Why are you...
I walked so far...
I told you that you wouldn't be able to leave.
If you still don't believe me, would you like to try again?
I don't like him.
Huh?
Did you trip? Your leg's scraped.
It's bleeding! We have to treat it.
Stay still.
I won't let anyone lay so much as a finger on you.
Liar.
You don't need to cry! All you have to do is live here from now on.
Yonomori-sama has already forgiven you too.
I'll treat you way better than Tomoe, anyway.
It shouldn't be the right season, but those plums are still budding.
This isn't part of the real world, is it?
Yup, those plums are always like that.
We stopped the time here while they were the most beautiful
Yonomori-sama likes them quite a lot.
Would you like to sleep now?
Excuse me?!
I won't do anything.
You can wait until you're ready... right here, forever.
Here you go!
Tomoe, I'm right here.
If you're truly my familiar, come save me.
We'll be right back after this.
Nanami-sama has been...
Nanami-sama has been kidnapped?!
She has become a snake's bride?
Our shrine is doomed!
Don't cry, Onikiri.
We still have hope! Look!
Look at Tomoe-dono's composure!
He has been polishing those vases since his return.
It's as if nothing is amiss!
Actions worthy only of Japan's finest familiar! You can count on him!
He surely has a plan!
We're doomed!
This shrine's done for!
Will you shut up?!
I never thought I'd lose my composure to this extent.
With such little strength, I might not be able to protect her.
She might be crying right now.
I'll have to take back what I've let go.
I'll have to take back what I've let go.
And that's a promise.
Mizuki?
This is an impressive shrine.
The deity is enshrined and everything is in order.
Yet, something feels off.
Breakfast! Breakfast!
That's your breakfast!
Now eat it, human deity.
Screw you!
Looks like being a host isn't that easy.
Yonomori-sama refuses to have anything except sake.
And as a result, Mizuki-dono's sake is first-class!
Yonomori-sama also calls him the best familiar ever!
Well, Tomoe cooks better than anyone, takes care of the shrine, and has manners,
unlike you lot.
So he's good at cooking?
Do you know Tomoe?
I do.
I've known him a lot longer than you have.
He's a white spirit fox.
I don't need you to tell me!
Tomoe-kun must have the worst luck.
He lost his master again. I can see him now, sitting there, moping.
You're one to talk. I saw you doing just that.
This shrine's missing something.
Mizuki, you said that no one comes to this shrine.
How long has it been that way.
Huh? I wonder...
Eh?
Wait, no! Don't touch Yonomori-sama!
As I thought, this shrine has no deity.
Mind telling me what's going on?
Tomoe-sama, we've located her.
The snake resides down there.
In a dam, huh?
As expected, there are no signs of humans.
A temple of water getting flooded? How ironic.
Tomoe-dono, is Nanami-sama down there?
Though there are many white snakes,
I know of only one who has absolutely no common sense,
who was raised in a freaking box, and is stupid enough
to try and marry a deity.
The river nearby has been there for eons.
Kids would sometimes drown in it.
The townspeople thought it had to be a curse, so they built this shrine.
That's where our story began.
A deity like Yonomori-sama, born out of necessity, cannot survive without worshipers.
When the people abandoned this shrine, Yonomori-sama had to go into hiding.
But I won't abandon it.
I'll stay here and protect this shrine with Yonomori-sama.
Because that's my duty.
He's been here the whole time in this husk of a shrine, even though its deity is gone.
I can't imagine how...
It must have been hard on you, Mizuki.
You see, I recently became a deity,
and I also have a familiar, Tomoe.
I can't stand the thought of Tomoe being sad, the way you are now.
I wouldn't want him to be bound by what I say.
I'd rather have him be free to do whatever he wants.
I bet Yonomori-sama feels the same away.
When Mikage-sama quit on him, Tomoe handled it pretty well!
Everything's going to be fine! Mizuki, you should
Are you trying to comfort me?
You're so nice, Nanami-san.
You could comfort me more by staying here forever.
We can watch the plum buds together, forever.
We can stay here, forever.
Sorry.
I can't stay here.
There are people waiting for me to come back.
I have no doubt that Tomoe's looking for me, too.
Why? Am I not good enough for you?
Let go! You said you wouldn't do anything to me!
Sorry, I've changed my mind.
Wai
No! Help, Tomoe!
You dare lay your hands on my master?
I hope you're ready for the consequences!
Tomoe!
Get away from her.
Nanami!
I'm so glad...
you're safe.
You took your time!
Man, I didn't think you'd find us here.
I see you still haven't learned any manners, Tomoe.
The flames...
You'd be lucky to get off with just a curse for burning the shrine of a water deity.
Though, I wouldn't expect that to stop you.
Now, you don't actually plan on fighting me, do you?
You're but a fool compared to a true familiar like me.
You'd be lucky if I so much as acknowledged you.
Is there some kind of hierarchy for shrine familiars?
A water deity shrine?
This?
Both your deity and your shrine were washed away long ago!
This place is nothing more than an alternate plane you created to play out your fantasy as a familiar!
Thanks to you, I had one hell of a time finding it.
Now, are you ready to owe up to what you did to my master?
Extinguish!
You're too late.
My fires have already spread too far.
You'd lost the moment I entered.
And when Nanami was in my arms once more, you lost a second time.
The third time will be the last.
Mizuki-dono, the field's on fire!
Mizuki, I won't die. I'm simply returning to the earth.
But I'm worried for you.
Promise this tree that even when you're alone, you won't cry.
Ah, I'm glad that you're okay.
I see. That's why this place exists.
This entire shrine and even the plane around it were just a stage for that tree.
T-That's right. This is the only thing I have left.
This tree is all I have left that connects me to Yonomori-sama. It's precious to me!
You understand, don't you, Tomoe-kun? We're both familiars!
Yes, I understand so well that it hurts.
Tomoe?
That's why I'm going to burn both you and that freaking log into ashes! You'll atone for your sins!
No! Tomoe, don't!
Stop!
Yonomori-sama likes this tree.
Let's live together and watch the buds.
Forever...
Tomoe, it's fine now.
Mizuki,
Tomoe's here now, so I have to leave.
I'm sorry I can't stay with you,
but I promise that if you ever feel lonely, I'll come watch the buds with you.
I promise...
Tomoe, you seem upset.
I'm not.
You seem awfully close to that snake.
You even promised to see him again, right in front of me.
Do you think I'm some sort of prop?
Yeah, he's angry.
Well, I couldn't just ignore him.
If I were to die,
and you were left alone like Mizuki...
The thought of that made me do it.
You're being ridiculous.
Hmm?
Were you hurt?
I'm fine, I just tripped.
I'm sorry.
Huh?
I left you alone...
She bleeds because of a little scrape.
Geez, Tomoe, don't suddenly act so nice.
She might die if she ever falls from a tree.
I might end up taking advantage of you!
This fragile girl is the foundation upon which I exist. I'm in grave danger.
Are you listening?
Ugh, she's a handful.
Let's go home.
I have to make sure that she doesn't break,
and that I don't break her.
The deity of thunder attacks?
Taking Nanami's deity seal, she attacks Tomoe!
What's happening? Tomoe shrank!
How adorable! Wait, this isn't the time for that!
Next time, The Deity Loses Her Home
This seems to happen a lot.
