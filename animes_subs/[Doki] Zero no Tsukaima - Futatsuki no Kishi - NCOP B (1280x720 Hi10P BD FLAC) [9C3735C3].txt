I SAY YES
STAY WITH ME
I SAY YES
FOR E VER
Ill be by your side forever
No matter what future tests us

Ah, its our destiny
I was able to meet you
Because I heard your voice
Yeah, even if crisis events
Press on at me
If Im with you, then I can overcome them
Palpitations and competitive spirit
Excite me on the contrary, but-
I only want to protect you
We were born in distant worlds
Ill be by your side forever
Lets change any future into hope
Ill be by your side forever
No matter what future tests us

Ah, its our destiny
I was able to meet you
Because I heard your voice
Yeah, even if crisis events
Press on at me
If Im with you, then I can overcome them
Palpitations and competitive spirit
Excite me on the contrary, but-
I only want to protect you
We were born in distant worlds
Ill be by your side forever
Lets change any future into hope
