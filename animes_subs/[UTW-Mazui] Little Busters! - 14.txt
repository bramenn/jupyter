No matter what it is...
Soon after it passes, everything fades to gray.
Memories of the past become but elusive clouds,
disappearing with just a wave of your hand.
Nishizono-san used to read books under that tree.
But... when did that happen?
I started to forget.
hitori ga tsurai kara futatsu no te wo tsunaida
It was too hard for one to do, so two of us held hands

It was too hard for one to do, so two of us held hands
futari ja samishii kara wa ni natte te wo tsunaida
But two would be too lonely, so we all came together in a circle and held hands

You're in love with Nishizono, aren't you?
Well, she's cute, right?
Your face is getting all red!
Yet not too long ago, they'd been ignoring Nishizonocalling her shadowless...
Oh, you're still here?
We're about to leave.
See you later, Nishizono!
Bye, Mio!
See you tomorrow!
Riki-kun.
Why won't you look at me?
Midori.
Just tell me, where's Nishizono-san?
What will you do if I tell you?
I'm going to bring her back here.
You're pretty stubborn, Riki-kun.
Everyone else has long since forgotten Mio and now thinks I'm her.
I won't forget Nishizono-san.
Is that so?
Memories become vague with time, you know.
For example...
Do you remember what Mio was wearing when you last saw her?
See? You don't.
She was...
What kind of glasses was she wearing?
Glasses?
Nishizono-san didn't wear glasses.
What?! You forgot already?
I know they weren't flashy, but she wore red bean-colored glasses.
I see. So I guess you just don't remember.
Red bean-colored?
That's right. She did.
How could I forget?
Just kidding!
I was just kidding.
Mio never wore glasses.
B-But I just
Was that just an illusion my brain created?
See?
A word or two was all I needed to jumble up your memories.
Sooner or later, you're going to think that I was Mio the whole time!
Isn't that fine?
Your memories are all just illusions made in your head.
And besides, everyone is happy with that.
To tell you the truth, Mio did wear glasses.
See? You're confused again!
Riki-kun, I actually like that about you.
It doesn't seem like it'll take much more to make you forget.
My memories began to fade like the lights of the classroom at dusk.
What kind of girl was Nishizono-san?
How much of it really happened?
How much of it was made up in my head?
I see.
So it's bothered you for that long.
I can't explain it very well,
but I feel like this world is becoming more and more transient.
At this rate, I'll just be washed away.
I'm afraid of forgetting Nishizono-san.
Kyousuke, talk to Midori!
You might be able to tell the difference between them.
I don't know Nishizono Mio as well as you do.
If I talk to her now, I'll probably think that she's Nishizono Mio, just as everyone else does.
And, I'm sorry.
I don't understand your feeling that the world is becoming more transient.
I don't feel the same way.
I don't think I'll be of any help to you.
There is only one thing I can do,
and that, Riki, is to give you your next mission.
My mission?
That's right. It's an important one too.
Do not trust.
Do not trust any words other than your own.
Believe in yourself.
For Nishizono Mio's sake.
That's right.
For Nishizono Mio's sake, I will not forget.
I will not forget.
I will not forget.
Will not forget what?
Will not forget what?
I will not forget.
I will not forget.
I will not forget that I cannot forget.
I will not forget.
Will not forget who?
Do not trust any words other than your own.
Believe in yourself.
Kyousuke's words have always helped me make it through.
How about we participate in a tanka contest?
That being the case, we need you for this activity, Nishizono.
Can you lend us your talents for this?
Thanks to you, I've thought up a tanka.
I think I might submit it to the competition.

Riding on the wind, with these white wings...
Planes made of paper obviously must fall at some point.
Yet, if I could ride one of those paper airplanes somewhere...
that may be something spectacular.
Naoe-san, where would you like to go?
If you were riding on a paper airplane.
Where would I like to go?
Let's see...
The blue sky and white clouds...
Somewhere with palm trees.
Maybe Hawaii.
Was it that funny?
Sorry, but you seemed like a child.
Riding on the wind
These white wings will carry us
I shall go with you
Border of the sky and sea
Isle in summer ceaselessly
She made a poem out of that conversation.
Nishizono-san,
you were there.
You were living, breathing, and laughing there.
I won't doubt myself anymore.
You are undoubtedly the real Nishizono Mio.
You want to see Mio, don't you?
It'll only make you sad.
Where is she?
Hey, Riki-kun.
If air is transparent, then why is the sky blue?
It's the same with the sea.
The water is so crisp and clear,
yet when we call it sea it inevitably turns blue.
Where does it get its blue from?
How did you know I was here?
Midori told me.
She did?
I came to bring you back, Nishizono-san.
She is Nishizono Mio now.
As she's always been and always will.
The world will change to fit that.
And that's all right with you, Nishizono-san?!
Who is Midori?
The first time I met Midori was...
when I was young.
Back then,
I already enjoyed reading books and sinking into the world of imagination.
Hey, you're always alone when I see you.
I wish you could be the prince in this story.
You'll be the princess then, okay?
Who are you?
I'm Midori, Onee-chan.
Don't tell me you forgot your own little sister!
Let's play together!
Okay.
I was fully embraced in my dreams.
My dreams and reality had become one and the same.
I played with Midori every day.
But I was the only one who could see her.
Grade 6 Class 2
Nishizono Mio
I wish I could go to school too.
You have a lot of friends there, right?
There's no place for me at school.
Do you want to switch places?
It's normal for children to play with imaginary friends.
But to keep them until the late years of elementary school is rather troubling.
I received treatment.
They repeated it over and over,
The girl named Midori does not exist.
Eventually, the time I was able to see Midori decreased.
Once every three days.
Once every week.
Days without seeing Midori became normal.
Until...
Where's Midori-chan?
Midori?
Who's that?
I don't know her.
I'd completely forgotten the little sister that I'd cherished so much.
Until I read that poem.
Does not a white bird Feel within her heart forlorn? The blue of the sky, The blue of the sea. Neither Stains her; between them she floats.
Does not a white bird Feel within her heart forlorn? The blue of the sky, The blue of the sea. Neither Stains her; between them she floats.
Does not a white bird
Feel within her heart forlorn?
The blue of the sky,
The blue of the sea.
Neither
Stains her; between them she floats.
A lone white bird, drifting between the sky and the sea.
If that were not Midori, then who was it?
I fell unconscious.
And when I woke up...
I realized that I had lost an important part of myself.
I've always kept my parasol with me since then.
Midori disappeared because I forgot about her.
She must hate me for it.
One day, she would appear before me again.
I waited for her.
Waited for the day I would disappear instead of Midori.
Because I'm the one who should've disappeared instead of her.
Naoe-san, thank you for remembering me.
I loved your stories about the Little Busters and when you were young.
The atmosphere around you and your friends was warm and comforting.
Perhaps I wanted to stay in that circle of friends and feel that warmth for a little longer.
Why not just stay with us from now on?
You could be part of that circle!
Let Midori join that circle instead.
I will become the nobody that I am.
If you could forget who I was,
then I could go to that place, between the sky and the sea.
Why do you want to go there?
Because that will free me from being Nishizono Mio.
I want to be alone.
Like a white bird that becomes neither the blue of the sky nor sea.
Beyond pain and sadness, I will be myself.
I will not be stained by anything; I will be eternal.
The only way for that to happen is for me to be alone.
Goodbye, Naoe-san.
Please be the one to close my coffin.
With these tears, my memories flow from within me.
The past, the experiences.
I begin to forget everything.
If I forget, Nishizono-san will have the eternity that she desired.
No, I can't cry!
Once these tears dry, I will forget why I'm here!
I'll return to my regular life.
Nishizono Midori will become part of the class, be liked by everyone, and laugh happily under the sun.
And I will probably accept it.
The world will regain its balance,
and the days will go by just like they always have.
Hey, Riki-kun. How ya doin'?
Midori...
So you still remember me?
You've been crying?
There's something you have to do, and it's not crying.
I know.
I'm bringing back Nishizono-san.
To this world!
Yeah.
That means it's time to say goodbye.
It was short, but it was fun.
Midori, what will happen to you?
I didn't forget Nishizono-san.
So Midori, no matter what happens, I won't forget about you!
I promise.
Bye-bye, Riki-kun.
Take care of my sister.
Let's go.
Let's live.
Nishizono-san!
Some time back,
you said that your life was petty.
That even if you disappeared from this world, nobody would remember.
I felt the same before.
I also wanted to disappear back then.
But if I disappeared,
then everyone would've forgotten that I was once even here.
But Kyousuke took my hand.
That's why I'll hold my hand out to you.
Nishizono-san, Nishizono-san!
Just as Kyousuke did to me!
That girl who sat quietly under the keyaki tree.
That girl who put her dreams on a white paper airplane.
I can't let that girl disappear from this world!
Nishizono-san!
Naoe-san?
You don't have to wish for loneliness, because we're already lonely!
People can never truly understand each other!
That's why we communicate and try to understand!
We can only understand ourselves through being with others!
You will truly become the one and only Nishizono Mio by being with us.
By being with everyone...
Yup. That's what you truly wanted, Onee-chan.
Midori...
Onee-chan, thank you for remembering me.
When you communicate with others, you'll become the real Nishizono Mio.
I will become whole and melt into the world.
The two of us will become one.
We'll be together forever.
Forever.
Midori...
We'll be together... forever.
yorimichi wo shite takai kousha no okujou
Taking a little detour, I climbed to the roof of the school
Where are we?
keburu keshiki wo miteta
To see hazy streets around it
We're living in this world.
iroaseta machi
The town fades to gray,
We're alive!
aka ni midori kasa no iro dake ga haeru
Red and green, only my umbrella has any color
amadare ga shitataru tabi
Each time a raindrop falls from the sky
amadare ni kokoro furueru
Each raindrop makes my heart quiver
anata ga shirushitekureta
You wrote me to feel the scars
kizuato no nazori kata wo
Of my heart this way
tooku ni wa kawa
In the distance I see a river
kasumu hashiwataru densha yurete mo koko wa
And, through the mist, a train crossing the bridge, rattling on the tracks
shizuka
But it's so quiet here
todokanai koto wakatta toki ni wa
When I realized that I would never reach it,
anata no ano kotoba
I remembered your words
hitotachi wa kono sora tobu koto wa kanawanai kedo
Though we humans will never be able to fly through the sky,
sono kawari
But in our place,
ima nagasu namida wa ten ni nobori mata
The tears we shed rise to the sky and
ame to narikaeru
Once again fall as rain

That's Why I'll Hold My Hand Out to You
It's a boring night.
Let's make Riki-kun our toy tonight.
Yay!
Wafu!
Awesome!
Stop it, Kurugaya-san!
Mission, start!
