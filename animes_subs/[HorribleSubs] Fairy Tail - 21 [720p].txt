Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
That was a great job!
And it looks like the client really appreciated it.
Well, we finished it up real quick since I was there.
Huh? And what makes you say that, jerk?
Just thinking about how you were nothing but extra baggage for this job.
How about I teach you what kind of extra baggage I am?
That made no sense at all.
Settle down!
And put on some clothes.
Upa.
That's not fair!
I'm the one who says that!
That's right, we can do it!
Let's go for even more who-knows-what!!
The door to mystery is right in front of us
The whole world's a wonderland
which we're already wondering!!!
This excitement gets my heart racing
It's wonderful!
Who am I, I wonder?
What is real, I wonder?
Why can't I see tomorrow, I wonder?
The only part leveling up is my curiosity
We can't just throw away our daily life together, right?
Tell me! S. O. W.
Living itself will be our training!
So, we can make it!
Let's search for even more who-knows-what!
We can't be satisfied with just the normal answers
This magical wonder life
Our future is wondering!!!
We'll do our best living our life
the way we want to!
Let's wondering!!!
Um, I hate to interrupt your conversation, but...
What?
I was the one who chose this request on my own, originally...
So why did everyone come with me?
Well, obviously.
Obviously, what?
'Cause we're Fairy Tail's strongest team!
Aye!
That's right.
Well, okay...
Put together me, Happy, Erza, and underpants-man, and there's no job we can't do!
Don't call me underpants-man.
Yes, it gives me reassurance.
Aye!
Forgetting someone?!
We're kiddin', sheesh!
Don't cry, Oopy!
I'm not crying, and I'm not named Oopy!
I apologize.
Even I was carried away. And I have ended up hurting my comrade.
I cannot allow this to continue...
For now, would you please punch me?
That's not the punch-line I had in mind...
Let it go.
It's Fairy Tail wizards...
I guess they don't know yet.
The poor things...
We're drawing an unusual amount of attention.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Frightened?
What's this? The guild shouldn't look like that.
That's...
What happened?
W-What?
Phantom Lord!
Our...
Our guild has been...
What in the world happened?
Phantom...
What did you just say?
Did you say Phantom?
I hate to say it, but they got us.
This is Fairy Tail's first basement floor.
It's normally used for storage, but it's been turned into a temporary beer hall.
We've always been on bad terms with Phantom.
Maybe we should go crush them.
I said to stop that.
We're up against Phantom... That Phantom...
Huh?
We have returned.
Gramps, what're you sittin' around here for?
How was it, Lucy?
The job go well?
Yeah...
Master, don't you understand the situation we're in?
The guild's been busted up!
Now, now... Calm down.
It's not something to get so riled up about.
What?
Phantom? That's all those half-wits got in'em?
Attacking the guild when nobody was here? Who'd take pleasure in that?
Nobody was here?
It seems the attack happened in the middle of the night.
So that's why no one is injured.
I suppose it's one small thing to be thankful for.
If they can only manage a sneak-attack, we shouldn't even give those bastards the time of day.
They aren't worth our time!
This ain't right, man!
I won't be satisfied until we go and crush these guys!
This discussion is over.
Until the upstairs is repaired, we'll take work requests from here.
This isn't time for doing jobs!
Natsu!
I've had about enough out of you!
And you spank me, why?
Master, I'll get angry!
Gramps!
Just a second...
Gotta pee.
Why're you okay with this, Gramps?
Natsu...
This is just as hard for the master, you know.
But outright conflict between guilds is forbidden by the Council.
Well, they're the ones that attacked first!
That's not the problem.
If that's how the master feels...
There is nothing we can do.
Things have really gotten complicated, haven't they?
Hey Missy! Don't blame me if you fall in!
Phantom is famous for not getting along with Fairy Tail.
I actually fretted trying to decide which one I wanted to join.
After all, their reputation is nearly as nuts as Fairy Tail's!
But I think I made the right decision joining here.
Because Fairy Tail is...
Yo!
Whassap?
Nice room you have here.
There's a lot of y'all!
The incident with Phantom means that they've come to this town.
It's possible they've looked up where everyone lives.
So it'll be safer if we stay in groups.
That's what Mira-chan said.
I see.
Everyone is having sleepovers here and there today!
You are a girl of a certain age,
and even I would be a bit uncomfortable staying with just Natsu and Gray.
That's why I have decided to keep you all company.
We're not here to relax!
So Natsu and Gray staying with me was already decided?
And why at my house?
Her laundry!
Hey, cat over there, what are you...
And Plue, what are you doing?
Ooh, Plue! What's that you're eating?
Let me have some!
Erza, look! I found some sexy underwear!
Wow! You actually wear this?
I'm hittin' the hay so pipe down, okay?
I'm glad you're enjoying the change of pace in someone else's home...
Anyway... You all smell like sweat.
We're sleeping in the same room, so at least take a bath.
Don't wanna! What a pain...
But I'm sleeepy...
I suppose I must. Shall we take a bath together like we used to long ago?
What kind of relationship do you guys have?!
We're the Strongest Team!
That's not the kind of strength it means!
You sure about this, Levy?
Wouldn't it be better for you to stay with Laki at the girl's dorm?
It's fine. No problem!
We're a team, right?
Levy!
There's nothing to fear with the three of us!
I'll protect you, Levy!
No, I will!
Okay, Natsu... You can use it next.
How about you, Gray?
That was a nice bath.
Erza, even... They've all made themselves way too much at home...
Oh, pardon me.
Nothing wrong with this, yes?
You even requip to change clothes?
Then!
I wonder why Phantom suddenly attacked?
Who knows?
We've had a lot of smaller skirmishes before this,
but never such a direct attack.
If Gramps weren't such a scardey-cat we could just destroy the punks!
You're awake?
Gramps isn't scared.
He's one of the Ten Wizard Saints, you know.
What do you think you're reading so nonchalantly?
Hey! I wanna know what happens next!
No! Levy-chan is going to be my first reader. It's already been decided.
And what's that hand for, huh?
Anyway, you mentioned Ten Wizard Saints?
It's a title bestowed by the Chairman of the Magic Council to the greatest ten wizards on the continent.
Oh, wow!
The master of Phantom, Jose, is also one of them.
As well as that man...
His is scared!
The only thing Phantom's got are numbers!
Please calm down...
That's not true, you know.
The master and Mira-chan want to avoid a fight because they know the consequences of two guilds battling each other.
It's to help preserve the peace of the entire world of magic!
Is Phantom really that amazing?
Those guys ain't nothing!
No... If it came to blows, mutual destruction is ensured.
Our offensive powers are about equal.
Master Makarov is said to be on par with Master Jose, also one of the ten wizard saints.
Then there are the Element 4, their S-class level wizards.
Our biggest worry is Iron Gajeel.
He's the one I believe is responsible for the attack on the guild.
The Iron Dragon Slayer.
Dragon Slayer?
There are ones other than Natsu?
So does that mean he like... eats iron and stuff?
I heard you attacked Fairy Tail, Gajeel!
I bet they're all feelin' really blue right about now!
Serves'em right, you know?
I've told you before. Don't talk to me when I'm eating.
Trash!
Who cares about those Fairy Butts?
We're more powerful than them.
The seed has been sown.
Excellent work, Gajeel-san.
Not so fast, Master.
That trash won't act from just that.
So I left them an extra little present.
Well, well...
Just make sure to keep that one alive, please.
Magnolia Southgate Park.
Please, let us through.
We're from the guild.
Somebody get them down from there!
But...
Look at that mark!
We'd better steer clear...
Levy-chan!
Jet! Droy!
Phantom?!
Master...
I can stand being reduced to a run-down beer hall...
But no parent can stand idle while the blood of his children is spilled!
To war!
Magnolia Hospital.
They are also equipped with facilities to treat wizards.
Droy...
Jet...
Levy-chan!
How could Phantom do this to you?
I'm super curious, Lu-chan!
They say you're writing a novel?
The rumor's already made the rounds?
Aye!
I think I have a good idea who it was that spread it around...
Oh, yeah! I never properly introduced myself.
I'm Levy!
Levy McGarden!
And this here's Jet...
Howdy.
Y-You're cute!
We're...
Glad to hear it...
You see, I'm hopeless at writing, but I love reading books!
If you don't mind, would you let me read your book?
B-But... It's not something I'd want to show other people...
What're you talking about?
Isn't the point of writing to let other people read it?
They say that being an author is like showing off your butt to everyone, right?
You won't get anywhere being embarrassed.
Let me see! Let me see!
Please!
And I'm not talking about your butt...
That might be fine, too, though...
I'm still working on it...
Then when it's finished, can I be the first person to read it?
Okay!
It's a promise!
Yay!
And she worked so hard for us back then...
I won't forgive this!
They'll pay!
Oak Town, in the North-East of the Kingdom of Fiore.
In the center, towering above the old castle town, is a branch of the Phantom Lord guild.
This is great!
Those Fairy Butts are all busted up!
And I hear that Gajeel went and did in three more of'em!
So, let's go do some work!
And on our way back, we'll pluck off a few Fairy wings!
Fairy Tail!
I don't care who... Bring it on!
Finish them off!
Purple Net!
Wakaba!
Gotcha!
Smoke Crush!
Guns Magic!
Spark Shot!
Eat this!
Nice shot, Bisca!
You're getting rusty, Al!
Target Lock On!
Homing Shot!
He's a monster!
You laid hands on this monster's children!
Don't think any human laws will protect you!
He's strong...
And the rank-and-file ain't bad either!
These guys are nuts!
So these are Fairy Tail wizards?
Pict Magic!
Nature, run wild!
The Dam of Shy Love!
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
I found a cat!
Finally, someone we can beat!
Aye...
I'm a...
So what if I'm a cat?
Sorry'bout that...
Jose, show yourself!
Where are they?
Where are Gajeel and the Element 4?
So that's Titania Erza.
Laxus and Mystogan are sitting things out, huh?
Cocky bastards...
But things are going pretty much according to Master Jose's plan.
They rage pretty good for trash...
Everyone left me behind.
Levy-chan and her team need someone to care for them, so I guess that's me.
Oh, no! A sunshower?
Who is it?
Drip, drip, drop.
Yes.
Juvia is the rain-woman.
Drip, drip, drop.
Who are you?
Um, who might you be?
Drip, drip, drop...
What?
It was a pleasure. Fare thee well.
Like, what the heck?
Non, non, non!
Non, non, non!
Non, non, non, non, non, non, non!
With non of 3, 3, 7, I say to you, bonjour!
It's another weirdo!
Juvia-sama, you mustn't abandon your job now.
Monsieur Sol.
My monocle, it whispers to me, yes.
It tells me that this mademoiselle is our beloved cible.
Oh, so it was this girl?
Cible?
Target?
I do apologize for the late introduction.
My name is Sol, one of the Element 4.
People call me Sol of the Land... Please call me Monsieur Sol!
The Element 4?
Phantom!
Correct!
We two have come to collect you for the great Phantom Lord!
And this is the rain-woman of the Element 4.
People call her Juvia of the Deep.
How dare you do such a thing to Levy-chan!
Non, non, non!
With non of 3, I correct your error!
Destroying your guild and attacking Levy-sama was all the work of Gajeel-sama!
Well, it is true that all of us in the guild were for the idea, however...
What is this?
Let me go!
Juvia's water lock cannot be broken.
Tres bien!
Do not fear. Juvia will not kill you.
Because it is Juvia's job to bring back...
Victoire!
We have captured the target.
Drip, drip, drop...
Then how'bout some of this?
Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up!
What's with this guy?
He ate the fire!
Could it be? He's...
I'll blow you all away!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Ice Make Lance!
Wood Make: The Distance Between the Two is Forever!
Yup, no clue!
Guns Magic! Mad Shot!
Requip! Magic Shotgun!
Wide Shot!
Not bad, droopy eyes!
Pretty good yourself, squinty eyes!
They're ours now!
Let's go!
Erza!
I'll leave the rest here to you guys!
Master!
Jose is likely on the top floor...
I'll put him out of commission for good...
Please be careful...
Now that the biggest threat's gone,
maybe I should mix it up a bit?
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
chasing after your profile left only in my revolving dreams
You said, I never want to see your face again, when you left me
But the tears on your cheek said it all
Every time you felt like you'd be swallowed up in the waves of contradiction
you always held back your tears, you know?
What a strong person, they said, but everyone overestimated you
and before you knew it you lost sight of who you really are
Then the sun I thought would always be near me collapsed
and the light shut off...
Rubbing out the truths and the lies of one day, altogether
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
still, ironically, chasing after your profile in my revolving dreams
Oh, crap! We forgot to take Lucy with us!
She might be angry that we left her behind this time.
She's real scary when she's angry...
Let's bring her something back as a present!
Aye!
But I think she'd rather we pay her rent for her.
Next time: Lucy Heartfilia!
Wait, I just heard Lucy's voice!
Maybe they're hounding her about the rent?
I'm scared, Natsu!
T-T-That can't be it, right?
