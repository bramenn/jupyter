Miku, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?
We don't need to be equals.
We need to be fair.
So then what should I do?
Are you talking about the campfire?
Y-Yeah.
The legend that the people in class were talking about
says that you have to hold hands at the finale.
Right.
Futaro has two hands.
Let's take both his hands.
Huh? Say what?
Never mind.
Sorry, I still have a cough.
You should be staying inside, not skiing.
But I just changed into my ski wear.
No.
You're sick. Stay in bed.
Ichika?
It's gotten worse, huh?
We both have some bad luck.
Huh? Did I ever tell Futaro-kun that I'm sick?
No, you just said...
Y-You were on speakerphone.
Oh, whatever.
So you two are together, right?
I'm kind of relieved, I think.
Okay, I'm going to head back, but I have a favor to ask of you two.
Find Itsuki-chan. She's on her own.
I'm sure she's actually lonely.
Weird.
How could Itsuki not be here?
That's rude.
Come to think of it, I haven't seen her since we started skiing.
I can't get through to her phone, either.
I wonder if she went to the advanced course.
F-Futaro?
You're sweating really bad. Are you okay?
I can't lie to myself any longer.
I must have gotten it from Raiha.
Which means Ichika got it from me.
I feel guilty.
You should get some rest.
Found you, Miku and Uesugi-san!
Did you really think I wouldn't find you here?
Yotsuba?
I forgot.
I already caught Ichika and Nino.
Itsuki's the last one standing.
You haven't found her, either?
Nope, unfortunately.
Jeez.
I'm looking for someone, too.
Ichika.
I told you to get some rest.
S-Sorry.
Yotsuba caught me.
Okay, Futaro, Ichika, you two are going back to the cottage.
Yotsuba...
Did Itsuki get away from you?
No.
I searched for her, but there was no hint of her anywhere.
Is something wrong?
This could be worse than I thought.
What? Tell us what's going on.
Lost?
Yeah.
Given how much we've run around the place, it's weird that none of us have seen her.
That doesn't mean...
Still can't get through.
Ichika, you're sure Itsuki said she was going skiing, right?
Y-Yeah.
Fantastic Course
Rookie Course
Professional Course
Kids Slope
I don't think I've gone there yet.
Over here.
Isn't that...
Isn't that the area Sensei warned us not to go because the path hasn't been maintained?
I'll go check the cottage to see if she's gone back.
I'll go talk to Sensei.
Hang on.
Let's look for her a little more.
Why?
We might need to call for a rescue.
Um...
I just think Itsuki-chan would rather not make a mountain out of a molehill.
What's that supposed to mean? I don't believe you!
Itsuki's life is on the line!
We can't take this lightly!
Sorry.
Where are you, Itsuki?
You should really rest, Futaro.
Uesugi-san?
I've almost figured it out.
Futaro?
Futaro?
I saw her somewhere today.
Uesugi-san!
Huh? Did I ever tell Futaro-kun I'm sick?
She almost caught you.
Is that you, Kintaro-kun?
Uesugi-kun!
I see!
So that's what happened.
Forget it.
Hang on.
I think I know how to find her.
Futaro...
How to find her?
Don't worry.
I'm sure we'll find her.
I can trust you, right?
Yeah.
Ichika, come with me.
Did you mean you were going to look for her from up here?
Yeah, something like that.
Sure, you can see a lot from up here, but...
W-Want to call it off?
Is that Itsuki?
Which one?
That one there.
The girl right below us.
Um... Th-That one?
I don't think so.
I figured.
I mean, he's obviously a guy.
Found you.
You have bad eyesight.
You can't see very well without your glasses.
Sorry I made such a big deal of this.
You had a hard time telling us, didn't you?
When did you notice?
It wasn't until a moment ago that I realized.
It was because you called me Uesugi-kun.
Uesugi-kun!
Ichika calls me by my first name.
I may not know you guys perfectly, but I know that much.
I hope he found Itsuki-chan.
Does Futaro-kun seem like such a bad person to you?
That's not what I mean.
But it's different when we're talking relationships.
I don't know anything about him.
We need to be more selective when it comes to men.
Itsuki-chan must still be going after him.
Don't worry.
Futaro-kun isn't like Dad.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to be sure.
You're so awkward.
You never follow through all the way.
U-Um...
Uesugi-kun?
You're being too forward...
Uh...
Uesugi-kun?
Uesugi-kun!
We'll be beginning the campfire soon.
All students, please gather at the common area.
I'm glad you brought him here.
We'll let Uesugi-kun get some rest here and see how he does.
Could someone bring his stuff?
Okay.
Sorry, it's my fault.
I'll stay with him.
Ichika...
I-I'll stay behind, too.
What's the point of you guys being here?
Let me be alone.
Hey, that's pretty cold.
We're all worried about you.
So there you have it.
Go on ahead.
But...
From now on, this room is out of bounds.
Now, get in.
Nino...
Can I talk to you for a second?
Futaro...
He actually brought himself to come to camp school.
Should we really let it end so miserably for him?
What's your plan for the last dance?
I don't know...
I think I might ask her now.
I wonder if she already has someone.
So I'm wondering if you'd like to dance with me.
How stupid.
Huh? What's wrong, Nino?
You were all hyped up about dancing with your soulmate.
I got rejected.
He said something came up that he has to attend to.
I ran into him on the slopes, and he asked me to tell you.
So it was him.
I wonder if he hates me.
No, well...
Well, I guess I'll wait, anyway.
Hey, Nino, that was...
Uesugi!
What are you doing?
Get some rest.
Sorry.
Cheer up.
Says the guy who's the most beat up.
You need to worry about yourself for once.
I can trust you, right?
Yeah.
Lame.
Seriously?
Huh? Nino?
I'm going to the washroom.
You should hurry. It's about to start.
I wouldn't mind dancing with you if you don't have anyone.
S-Sure.
For you.
It's important to stay hydrated when you have a cold.
Th-Thanks.
Wow, matcha soda comes in hot, too?
Your fever's gone.
I wonder if I gave him my cold.
Futaro was weird from the beginning.
Looking back now, I think he was sick the whole time.
I wish I'd paid more attention.
I was just too busy with my own problems.
Sorry.
I should have turned down the dance.
I wish I'd noticed sooner.
About the legend...
About your feelings...
And my own feelings...
Miku?
It's been bothering me the whole time.
About how you and Nino and the others get along with Futaro.
I didn't think it would be fair for me to be special.
That's not true.
But I'm done with that.
I want him all for myself.
I can't lie to myself about feeling that way.
But that's not for now.
I like Futaro.
So I'm going to do as I wish.
But you and the others can do as you wish, too.
I'm going to win.
It's exquisitely gross.
Is it?
But it works great.
Thanks.
Let's get going.
Yeah.
If I hadn't pretended to be Ichika...
Yotsuba.
Have you gotten Uesugi-kun's stuff yet?
Yotsuba?
These are Uesugi-san's bookmarks.
There are so many tabs and memos.
School Camp
He was really looking forward to this trip.
I dragged him around when he was sick and ruined it for him.
I shouldn't have done that.
In the end, we have no way of knowing what he felt
or what he's thinking.
Not unless we ask him.
But I'm sure it wasn't in vain.
Quintuplet games in the car.
The test of courage prep that Yotsuba helped with.
Maybe: skiing on the third day. (Yotsuba is supposed to teach me)
Surprising stories...
Do you think this is true?
Miku said it was a miserable ending, but I wonder if he had fun.
Who knows?
I'll ask Uesugi-san.
Right now?
I won't get caught if I'm careful.
She's so straightforward. I hope I can be like her.
Head Teacher.
Head Teacher?
Wh-What?!
The campfire is almost over.
Could you help me out?
All right.
You were sleeping, weren't you?
I tried doing what Yotsuba would do,
but sneaking in while the teacher's sleeping?
Was that taking it too far?
But I can't just leave him all alone.
I need to turn on the lights.
Um...
The switch should be around here.
You're all here?!
B-Be quiet.
Why are you girls here?
Why are you?
I just thought about lending him my really good lucky charm.
We came here because we were worried about Futaro-kun, right?
Yeah.
I'm kind of happy.
We were all thinking the same thing.
I told you, I wasn't.
You're so stubborn.
Uesugi-kun, we're all hoping you get well.
I don't really know what kind of person you are yet,
so when you wake up, could you please...
tell me more about yourself?
It's the finale of the campfire.
Please join in the countdown.
Ready, and...
Ten,
nine,
eight,
seven,
six,
five,
four,
three,
two,
one,
zero!
Hi.
Are you at the venue?
How could you forget that?!
I'll bring it, but look...
What, was it Futaro?
He left the wedding ring here.
What kind of groom does that?
Like father, like son.
He's not the only one?!
All right.
I'm going to marry someone better than you or Onii-chan.
Never!
Don't leave me all alone!
You don't have a boyfriend yet, right?
Onii-chan is as aloof as ever about everything other than work.
He's gotten better than when he was a student, though, hasn't he?
Yeah, but...
I'm worried he might not make a good husband.
Hey...
Is this all we're getting for breakfast?
Are our finances that bad?
They are, but that's not why.
It would be a waste to eat too much right now.
Lunch today is going to be a feast.
It's like a castle.
How did this happen?
No kidding.
It must be some kind of mistake.
You have to get changed this many times in one day?
I wonder if I'm going to wear something like this someday.
I'm going to put up your hair.
There you are.
Does he even know that today's a special day?
You're about to get married, you know.
Onii-chan's so pragmatic, though.
Maybe he doesn't even... care...
I haven't seen that in a while.
I didn't realize he still had it.
Congratulations on getting married, Onii-chan.
Introducing the groom.
Hey, you.
Uesugi-kun.
Hey.
Congratulations.
What? It's me.
You don't remember?!
Of course I do.
Maeda, right?
Mr. and Mrs. Maeda.
He really hasn't changed.
I know.
He's the cupid that brought us together, though.
The campfire legend, huh?
That takes me back.
Y-Yeah.
By the way, did you know?
Apparently, back then, the two of them also...
To be honest, I don't remember much about what happened.
But even though school camp was a disaster, I didn't hate it, strangely enough.
And now the bride.
The legend of the campfire.
Those who hold hands at the campfire at that moment will be together for life.
It must have been because they were there that even those bittersweet memories
seem so happy.
You were holding back that whole time, huh?
I really hadn't been paying attention.
Quit talking so out of character and be yourself.
The five of us are with you.
Let my power heal you.
What did you feel during the school camp?
He's awake.
Do you feel better now?
That charm actually works!
He's back to life.
You scared me. Jeez.
I was terrified.
Shut up.
Shut up!
I can't get any sleep!
Uesugi-san's angry.
He's fine now.
Get out of here!
I think I can say it now...
What I couldn't say back then.
Thanks for being by my side.
Futaro.
Uesugi-san.
You all.
Good morning.
Hey.
Are you feeling better now?
Yeah.
I need to make up for the time I spent hospitalized.
You can keep that for a little longer.
Did you say something?
Nothing.
Stop eating already, Itsuki.
I get hungry in the mornings.
I know.
To celebrate Futaro coming back to health,
we should all go to the crepe shop after school...
We're studying, right?
Futaro, I hope you help us lots with studying.
Studying together, huh?
Let's do this.
Hey, I never agreed.
Everyone besides you, then, Nino.
I never said I wouldn't join.
Uesugi-kun, we'll be in your care.
Right.
The finals are coming up, so I'm going to work you all hard.
U-Um...
You'd better be prepared, all of you!
Run!
