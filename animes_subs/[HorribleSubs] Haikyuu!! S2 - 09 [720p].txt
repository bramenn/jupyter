Dear Mom...
The weather in Tokyo is cool, but hotter than the Tohoku region.
Today is the third day of the week-long training camp.
We're almost at the turning point.
Go!
It's hot!
No saying hot!
It appears that everyone is nearly exhausted.
It has also been three weeks since Hinata and Kageyama-kun's argument.
Here.
Here.
Thanks.
Thank you!
Even though they're practicing together, they still aren't talking.
All right!
Service ace!
It's gradual, but it looks like they're making fewer mistakes.
Fukurodani Karasuno
And they narrow the point gap with every set they play.
I am surprised every day by their progress.
I was worried about Tsukishima-kun, who seemed down,
but apparently that's just how he usually looks.
Asahi-san, one more! Nice serve!
Nice serve!
Although he must be exhausted, he seems to be playing well.
However...
Damn it! It was short again!
All right!
Don't worry about it!
I'm sorry!
Hinata and Kageyama-kun's new quick is not working out very well.
At this rate
Sorry!
I hope I'm able to see it work at least once during this training camp.
Thanks.
Haikyu!!
Episode 09: VS Umbrella
It's their first long series of away games
and the temperature just keeps rising...
The going's going to get rough for them right about now.
Center!
Hinata, get the last!
Sorry! It was close to the net!
Damn it!
All right!
Everyone's gotten better.
It was only for a moment, but even Tsukishima was different.
I'm the only one who hasn't changed.
I don't think I've ever seen Hinata so agitated before.
Yeah...
Nekoma Karasuno
Chance ball!
Got it!
It's a chance for a quick...
This time, for sure...
I'll get it!
Nice cover! Nice cover!
Well done, Hinata.
Hey!
You held back, didn't you?!
Held... back?
Me? With volleyball?
Say that again.
Hey, come on.
Excuse me. Can we get a time out?
That wasn't the falling toss.
Huh? It wasn't?
No idea.
You probably need animal instincts to tell.
It wasn't?
I mean... Looking back, it technically may not have been...
I think what just happened is
that the toss right now wasn't like the falling tosses he's been getting,
but was more of a parabola.
Which means Kageyama was trying
Kageyama, calm down.
to get Hinata to hit the ball, no matter what.
Hinata hasn't hit a spike comfortably for a while now.
That's pretty stressful for a spiker.
Kageyama might have subconsciously been worried
that Hinata's might not play as well because of that.
But, Hinata...
Calm down, already!
I'm impressed that you could tell,
but is that something to get angry about?!
Don't you dare fight here!
If anything, he made sure you didn't miss!
Did I subconsciously back down just now?
Don't stop it, Kageyama!
I said, gather round!
Are you giving the shrimp the exact tosses he wants?
Have you even tried to?
What are you doing, Kageyama?
Starting tonight, I'm not practicing with you.
And I won't be using the new quick with you during matches.
What?!
I-Is their relationship worsening?!
You're the one that told me not to stop, aren't you?
There's no point in us practicing together right now.
Uh, um...
Okay!
Kenma, give me some tosses!
What?
Huh?
Kageyama started training by himself again.
I can't lose!
There's only one thing I need to do right now!
That's to be able to fight the blocks in mid-air by myself!
Gymnasium 3
Oh? Tsukki, did you bring a friend today?
Pardon?
What happened to your partner?
Kageyama's practicing on his own again.
I was trying to get Kenma to throw me tosses,
but he ran away after the fifth one.
It's amazing that you got Kenma to even give you five during practice.
So...
Please let me practice with you!
Lev!
Oh, Hinata.
Lev, I thought you were practicing receives with Yaku.
He said I was doing well today, so he let me go.
Really? Sure you didn't run away?
Hey, have you seen Lev?
Maybe he's in the bathroom.
No, of course not!
He said you said it was okay
and went running off.
I didn't say that!
Well, whatever.
Then...
We have the right number of people,
so let's play some three-on-three.
Eh?
Yay!
A match!
Owls Cats
Um...
Isn't this just a bit unbalanced?
Whoa!
I'm playing with a setter and an ace
from one of the Tokyo powerhouse schools!
And... versus Tsukishima!
It's fine!
Let's do things we can't do during the day!
Woo-hoo!
And then I looked over
and there was a giant rhinoceros beetle, and I totally freaked out.
Oh, I saw a stag beetle, too.
Lev!
I told you to jump after looking at the toss!
Read blocking!
Oh, right!
Don't try jumping too far to the sides when blocking!
Wow, he got it...
When you have enough time, full stop, then jump up!
Right!
Chance ball!
Full stop,
then jump up.
Damn it!
Bring it again!
Um...
If you don't wrap up soon,
the cafeteria will will close, and you won't get any dinner.
We cannot go into battle on an empty stomach.
Food!
Shrimpy.
We'll continue tomorrow, all right?
Yeah!
Haikyu!!
Haikyu!!
It's morning!
Let me sleep a little longer...
Cafeteria
Thanks for the food!
How is it that you eat that much,
and none of those nutrients go toward making you taller?
Mff mmm mrrrf.
Yeah... I have no idea what you're saying.
Ubugawa Karasuno
Gora, one more! Nice serve!
It's off! Kageyama, follow through!
Hinata!
Tanaka, free!
All right!
Sorry! I overcompensated!
Ubugawa Karasuno
Thank you very much!
Time for our penalty!
Right!
Tanaka, you get double.
That's not fair!
Whoa...
You know...
Go!
They've changed a bit.
I'm starving.
Same.
I'm so hungry that I'm starting to feel nauseous.
Same here.
But seriously...
I wonder how long they're gonna go on.
Next, please!
Damn it!
Kageyama, don't think of the bottle as a target.
Actually visualize it.
As much as you can, visualize a spiker.
Visualize the spiker...
Oh, by the way, when you're going one-on-one with a spiker,
don't try to block by centering yourself to their body.
Center yourself with their dominant arm instead.
Oh!
Um...
We are technically opponents as soon as we're in a match, right?
Why are you giving us advice?
I've always been a nice person.
You don't have to look at me like that...
I want to make the Battle at the Garbage Dump a reality.
All right, let's drink!
It's what our coach wants more than anything.
Yes!
Hm? Where did Keishin go?
But who knows
how much longer our coach is going to continue coaching?
He's apparently helping out
with the students' practices.
So because of that,
What? Get him over here, Sensei.
we need you guys to keep winning, too.
Yes, sir.
Well, it's practice for me, as well,
so don't sweat the small things.
Come on. Let's get back to practice!
Owls Cats
Akaashi, cover!
Sorry! It's a bit short.
Surround him! Spread out the block!
Damn it! You're still ridiculously huge for a first-year.
He hit the block on purpose?
One more time!
You better make that toss a good one, Akaashi!
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey!
Was that... on purpose?!
When you lightly hit the block.
Yup! It's a rebound!
A rebound? That's so cool!
Is it? It is, isn't it?!
You sure are good at flattering the airhead, Shrimpy.
When you aren't completely ready,
and you feel like your spike's going to get blocked for sure,
you purposely hit the block with the ball
and try one more time when it bounces back.
Well, of course, there are plenty of times
that fails and they just slam the ball down.
That happens quite often with you, Bokuto-san.
You're supposed to say, That's not true, there, Akaashi!
Spiking doesn't just involve slamming the ball into the ground.
If you're calm, you'll see how to attack.
Oh, that's not true, Bokuto-san.
You're late, Akaashi!
Owls Cats
All right!
Akaashi, nice!
Get the last part, Shrimpy!
Right!
Ah! Hey!
You guys are playing dirty!
This isn't even a wall...
It's more like an umbrella...
There isn't anywhere to aim.
If you're calm,
you'll see how to attack.
He hit up?!
Ow...
Did you... actually aim for that?
That was an amazing wipe!
Oh. Well, I did aim for Lev's fingertips.
What?!
It was sheer luck that it hit.
I can't hit that accurately
You were covered by three blockers, each around 190cm tall!
Not to mention that terrible toss!
Well done! I'm moved!
The valiant little warrior who fights in the face of a two-meter wall!
Talk about over-exaggerating...
Somehow 190 cm turned into two meters.
I shall give you a new special attack.
A special attack?!
Here's the next one!
Slot five.
One more.
I'm sure you must be pretty tired, Hitoka-chan.
Are you okay?
Yes! I'm sorry!
Today's the last day, so let's do our best.
Right!
Morning, Hinata!
Ah, Yachi-san. Morning!
Man, I'm starving!
Oh, yeah...
You sure are full of energy this morning.
You were up practicing late, too, weren't you, Hinata?
Yeah, but I just woke up.
How are things shaping up?
I'm practicing something super awesome right now, so look forward to it!
Super awesome...
What the heck, Tsukishima?!
Nothing.
Hey! Someone wake Yamaguchi up!
About the thing I was telling you earlier...
Yes, it's all been taken care of.
It should arrive around noon.
I see...
Seriously?!
Nekoma Fukurodani
Hmm...
We can't seem to win against Fukurodani much.
Nice serve!
Senpai! I tabulated all of the stats so they're easier to read.
Got it!
Thanks!
Right!
Shibayama's pretty great.
Left!
Fukurodani: 50 Wins 14 Losses Nekoma: 42 Wins 22 Losses Ubugawa: 36 Wins 28 Losses Shinzen: 29 Wins 35 Losses Karasuno: 3 Wins 61 Losses
As we thought, looks like Fukurodani's at the top right now.
Ubugawa Karasuno
Looks like Ubugawa and Karasuno finished.
One round of diving receives!
Right!
They have a strange dignity around them
when they take their penalties.
Including the last away games,
they've done more penalties than any other team.
I definitely couldn't do it.
Now, diving receives!
Whoa! Karasuno's Shrimpy's gotten really good at diving receives!
Shrimpy? Yaku-san, you're not much taller than Hinata.
Lev, stand over there!
There was no saving him from that.
Lev!
I told him not to mention Yaku-san's height...
That fool.
Damn it. We basically kept losing all the way to the end.
You guys need to keep doing your best and survive.
Daichi-san?
I just happened to hear this,
and I was going to keep it quiet...
Wh-What is it?!
When all of these practice matches are over...
Apparently, the coaches are going to treat us to a barbecue.
Bar...
Akaashi, who do we play next?
Karasuno.
Karasuno, huh?
What?
Well, they're sort of the hardest to play against.
Who knows what they're gonna do?
Well, it does look like they're getting pretty tired.
Meaty meat, meat, meaty meat!
Put'em together, you get meat and meat!
Meaty meat, meat!
Hooray for meat! Energy times a hundred!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
What the... They're terrifying.
Meat is god! Meat is god!
Sensei...
Did you not tell them about the barbecue?
It just says meal on the schedule.
Well, I guess it all worked out in the end.
Hinata, do your best in the match.
Thanks!
I'll be looking forward to that super awesome thing.
Just watch, you jerk!
But...
I really want to see that new quick soon.
Me, too.
Huh?
Kageyama!
I want to hurry up and hit that falling toss!
He just told you yesterday you guys won't be doing that quick...
Don't rush.
As long as I'm missing the tosses,
it won't be any practice for you.
What?!
Your will is not needed for that quick.
I'll give you tosses that won't be stopped by blocks!
He was saying all of that,
but Kageyama-kun was actually trying to respect Hinata..
I was thinking this yesterday, too,
but you're really creepy when you worry about others.
I get it, but hurry up and give me tosses!
I want to hit them!
That's why I'm practicing so hard, you dumbass!
And Hinata believes that Kageyama-kun will master that toss.
Ah...
So that's why he got so mad back then!
He completely believes that Kageyama-kun can do it,
but Kageyama-kun doubted himself for a second.
How long are you going to make me wait?
Hinata and Tsukishima-kun call Kageyama-kun the King...
But today,
it looks like the crown is on Hinata's head.
I demand the ultimate toss!
Fukurodani Karasuno
Anyway, try to work the new things you've all practicing into this match.
Right!
Also, I say this every time,
but put pressure on Fukurodani's 4 when he hits.
Right.
Yeah!
In the end, this training camp was filled with penalties,
but you guys should definitely feel different now
than you did in the first away games.
Let's get an awesome win here
and go eat some delicious meat!
Yeah!
Man, meat is the best.
And nothing goes better with meat than white rice.
I like eating them together, too!
Throw in a salad, and it's perfect.
All right! Let's win this match and eat some delicious food!
Yeah!
Next time on Haikyu!! : Cog.
