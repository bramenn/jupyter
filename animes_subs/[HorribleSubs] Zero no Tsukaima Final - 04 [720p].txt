King Joseph of Gallia's recent attack
came completely out of the blue!
It was an unspeakable attempt
to turn Romalia and many innocent people to ash.
We have been shaken by fear.
Being turned to ash is unbearable!
If you're turned to ash,
you can't even admire a woman's rear!
And that is boring!
Truly boring!
However,
these heroes stopped King Joseph's delusional plans.
They are the ones who saved Halkeginia, no,
the entire world!
Long live Tristain!
I'm truly relieved that you made it back alive.
Now let us eat, drink, and be merry!
Let us enjoy these hours of peace.
This way, please.
That's it?
Not even a reward?
If anyone's getting a reward, it would be Saito.
After all, he's the one who saved Romalia.
Oh, come on.
I'm serious.
Even an estate wouldn't be too much.
An estate...
I can't buy you a real mansion.
Maybe not now,
but someday.
The Queen's Reward
Sir Guiche, I'm so glad you're safe!
Are you hurt anywhere?
Thank you, I'm fine.
I'm sure it was your prayers that delivered me home safely.
You're just going to let that go on?
I'm used to it.
You just have to look at it like some sort of disease.
Well, it seems to have gotten worse.
You've got some nerve!
M-Montmorency...
How dare you kiss another girl in front of me?
That's not what happened!
I had something on my face
and she was just helping me get it off...
That's the lamest excuse ever!
This is it, I won't forgive you this time!
Thanks for saving us in Romalia.
It was nothing.
Saito is very grateful, too.
He is?
I hope I'll find my familiar soon
and have a relationship like you.
Oh, but we fight all the time.
Excuse me...
Tiffania, may I ask you for a dance?
You want to dance with me?
I'll leave you two alone.
L-Louise!
Good luck, Tiffa!
What am I going to do?
I can't dance!
Tiffania, please!
Well, you see...
It's sad when people don't know their places.
Have you seen your face recently?
Go wash your face and then come back!
Tiffania, you deserve a lord
with much higher standing than that scum.
B-Beatrice!
I swear on the honor of my family, Guldenhorf,
to find you someone much better.
U-Um, you really don't have to do that.
I was wondering where you were.
You should try some of this food, Louise.
Wow, this all looks good!
Hey, Saito.
These were really great, too.
I know you're a big fan
of melons.
Melons?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, Malicorne!
Bye then, little lemon!
What was he saying about melons?
It's nothing.
Are you sure?
I'm sure!
This song...
This was the first song we danced to.
Your hair and your dress are the same as that night.
Took you long enough to notice.
You can be so dense sometimes.
Sorry.
I'm happy we can dance like this again.
Oh, don't be dramatic.
I'm not being dramatic.
I felt like my heart would stop
when I heard that they took you.
I kept wondering what I'd do
if anything happened to you.
Saito...
That's when I truly understood
how important you are to me.
Saito...
I never want to leave your side again.
I want to be with you always.
It doesn't have to be big.
Let's buy a house together someday.
One for just you and me.
You mean it?
Yes.
Well, if you really insist, I suppose
I can go along with it.
Of course I insist.
I want to be with you forever, too.
Louise...
Saito...
Sh-Shall we go?
Y-Yeah.
Louise...
Now, hang on, you can't...
Saito!
I'm never letting you go.
We're together forever now.
Saito...
Siesta!
You!
You were going to try to get him in his sleep again!
You know me too well, Miss Valliere!
I warmed your bed for you.
But if you would like it to be warmer,
I will warm you.
I'm fine, but thanks for your concern, Siesta.
Concern, my eye!
You've got this totally perverted grin!
I don't, I don't...
But, I mean, I am a guy, after all.
Uh oh...
Jeez. Why are all guys like that?
It's so idiotic,
the way they run to this girl and that girl...
What's so funny?
Nothing.
I was just thinking that this is so peaceful.
We've really made it home.
Yeah.
The only one missing is Tabitha.
I wonder what she's doing now.
We had just gotten back here,
and then she took off for Gallia again.
She did receive a letter asking
for her immediate return quite urgently.
I hope she's not getting mixed up in some trouble.
She can take care of herself.
You're right...
Can this really mend her broken heart?
Take this.
This is the medicine that will mend your mother's heart.
I have a question.
Why did you become his pawn?
There was something I had to do.
That's all I can say.
My Lady!
Lady Orleans!
Charlotte?
Charlotte... It's you, isn't it?
Mother!
One, two! One, two! One, two!
It doesn't have to be big.
Let's buy a house together someday.
Oh, Saito!
That reminds me!
What?
With Saito?
Tiffa's so bad!
Yeah, she was on top of Saito like so
and trying to kiss him!
Really?
And when Malicorne saw them,
he started talking about melons.
If she's melons, would I be coconuts?
I can't stay idle!
And I'd put the living room here.
This would be the banquet hall.
And here I'd have our dinner parties...
We'll need to have some guest rooms, too.
And then...
The master bedroom.
Saito!
Louise...
No, I can't think about that!
That has to wait until we're married!
But we're going to live together!
No, no, I can't think about that!
Miss Valliere, something terrible happened!
Wh-What's wrong, Siesta?
What's the big rush?
Have you heard about how Miss Westwood
made a move on Saito?
What? Tiffa?
That's right!
They were saying something about melons!
So that's what the whole melon thing was about.
Well, I guess I can live with my pineapples.
I know I've got lemons!
What's this?
Don't look at that!
What is this supposed to be?
Can't you tell by looking at it?
It's the house where Saito and I are going to live.
That's it, Miss Valliere!
You should buy a house with Saito to prevent
Miss Westwood from seducing him.
A house with Saito?
Yeah!
You want to eliminate as many rivals as possible!
Y-You're right!
I've got to find a house where we can
both live before something bad happens!
You've got to come look!
This mansion's kitchen looks so spacious and convenient!
Your cooking is great no matter what, Siesta.
Oh, Saito!
I don't like it.
But this mansion was designed by
that one very famous architect.
If I don't like it, I don't like it!
What's wrong with it?
Why don't you just say it?
I agree.
Why are you here anyway, Siesta?
This house is for me and Saito!
This is none of your business!
But if Saito moves, I have to move with him.
Who decided that?!
Her majesty did.
Queen Henrietta made me Saito's personal maid.
Which means you can't fire me.
Let us three
just continue to enjoy each other's company, Miss Valliere!
If you're looking for a place for three people,
how about this?
Siesta!
So that was your motive for looking for a place!
Why can't Siesta come live with us anyway?
It's hard to find a good worker like Siesta.
I know that, but...
Oh, this is so wonderful!
Saito, come look at this!
That does look good.
It's got a big bath.
Big enough for two.
For two? Oh, you...
What's so great about this room?!
I hate it!
So you're saying you didn't find anything?
Yeah, first she insisted on finding a place,
then she did nothing but complain.
Of course we couldn't find anything.
I am the master!
What's wrong with looking until we find
something I'm happy with?
It doesn't matter where you live.
You should just go ahead and make sure,
before you get married.
Make sure of what?
That you're physically suited to each other, of course!
I'm not going to do that!
Then I'll do that first.
It's not easy to be popular with the ladies, huh, Saito?
I wouldn't say I'm popular, exactly...
We all heard, Saito! That's amazing!
Spectacular!
Wonderful!
Uh... huh?
What's going on?
They're talking about that...
The Queen's Knight?
That's right!
The play is extremely popular with the townspeople.
Come at me, evil and cruel army of Gallia!
Here I come!
Damn you, Incompetent King Joseph!
Our beloved Queen has sent me
to face any enemy of the Brimir faith!
I am the Swordsman of the Wind, Hiligil Sartom!
Silence, Hiligil Sartom!
Take this!
Is Hiligil supposed to be me?
Looks like it.
Go, Saito!
I'm done for!
Now for the final blow!
I finished him!
What a horrible play.
You were wonderful, Saito!
Truly great!
By now, Saito's the hero who saved His Holiness!
All the town girls are in love with him.
The town girls are...
We've got to find a mansion...
Yes!
Me? Be queen?
Yes.
Castelmore thinks so, too.
Castelmore was loyal to your father,
the Lord of Orleans.
Right now, Gallia has forgotten its pride.
It lies in confusion.
The people have forgotten how to smile,
and nobody knows what to do next.
This country needs you on the throne
to make itself whole again.
Charlotte.
Let me tell you something your father told me long ago.
He said, We must make this land better.
This land?
Yes.
And I would like to honor that memory.
You will agree, won't you, Charlotte?
We've been searching for three days now. Jeez.
How far do we have to go to find a decent mansion?
It's because you have to bicker about everything.
It's no wonder we haven't found anything.
A-Are you saying this is all my fault?
Saito.
Miss Valliere.
Agnes?
I've been looking for you two.
Queen Henrietta wishes to see you.
Please go to her court at once.
I got you into danger in Romalia.
Oh, but it's fine.
This is not to make up for that, but I
wanted you to know I was sorry.
Thank you.
That reminds me.
I received a message from Gallia.
It looks like Tabitha will become the new ruler of Gallia.
Tabitha?!
Yes.
I suppose officially it will be Queen Charlotte.
I wonder if that's what she really wants.
I worry about that as well.
Then again, it was Tabitha's decision.
I'm sure she gave it plenty of thought.
I'm sure she did...
Shall we enjoy this while it's still warm?
I'm honored that you received us like this.
Indeed. It was delicious.
Now, Saito, for all you have done to help,
you would be entitled to a reward
worthy of your status as chevalier.
However, right now...
It's fine. I don't need a reward.
No, I must insist.
I know it's meager, but I'd like to give you
a small fiefdom from my own holdings.
F-Fiefdom?!
What's a fiefdom?
If you are given a fiefdom,
it would mean that you would become
that holding's king! Its lord!
A lord? Me?
There's a piece of land in western Tristainia called De Ornieres.
I hope you will like it.
But isn't this too much for you?
I would feel guilty not rewarding
him in some way.
Right now, this is all I can do.
There's absolutely nothing here, as far as the eye can see.
Could there possibly be a mansion out here?
Excuse me.
We're trying to find De Ornieres fiefdom.
Then you've found it!
You mean this wasteland is it?
What about the mansion?
Where is the mansion?
It looks like a haunted mansion.
The princess sure likes to joke.
They do say your home is your castle.
Well, the princess did give it to me out of the
goodness of her heart.
Now hold on!
Don't tell me you actually want to live here?
You can go back if you don't like it, Miss Valliere.
Saito and I can live here all alone.
I will live here!
Of course I am going to live here!
Would you rather sleep on his right or on his left?
There are a million other rooms,
so go sleep somewhere else!
But I'm scared to sleep here alone!
What if a ghost comes?
Can't we all just get along?
Tabitha!
What are you doing here?
Moving in.
You put the coronation on hold?!
I'm going to sleep.
Wait, Tabitha, that's...
Looks like she's really tired.
Let's just leave her.
It is very late.
Goodnight, Miss Valliere.
Louise, calm down!
We're finally in our own mansion!
This is even worse than being at the academy!
Jeez, this stinks!
This mansion was supposed to be just for me and Saito,
but all these people keep getting in the way!
Tune in next time for The Maidens of De Ornieres.
Is that the princess kissing Saito?!
The Maidens of De Ornieres
