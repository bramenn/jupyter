Thank you very much!
What?
Porky was crushed?!
Lost by 13 cards
If I speak, it shouldn't be to ask if she's okay.
It should be to announce a win for Mizusawa!
may the wind bring clouds to extend their stay.
In the sleepy...
Chihaya-chan, are you...
Chihaya Furu
Verse 6
To set the Tatsuta River ablaze
In the sleepy spring sunlight,
What?
In order to restore hasn't been read yet
In the sleepy isn't a one-syllable card yet.
In the
sleepy
In order
to restore
So why?
Was it because she was camping that card?
I think she moved before I even heard In spoken.
That's impossible!
No human is capable of that.
She just happened to guess right!
Focus, Amakasu!
She's not guessing cards!
Ayase Chihaya can hear.
She can hear!
I don't know what it is in my voice that she can hear,
but there's a difference between
the In in In the and the In in In order.
I want to know what it is I'm telling her.
My voice isn't
telling her anything...
a whirlwind of flower petals descends.
She's taking control of my voice...
Nothing can be worse...
Again?
No more is still in play, but she moved on No.
There are other players who can move fast or react fast,
but that's not what she's doing here...
Huh?
Nine months have passed...
Stop taking cards with your speed.
It must have been hard, Chihaya-chan,
but you've made incredible progress.
You concentrated on your accuracy the first half,
and now you're taking risks to take cards with your speed.
You're giving yourself more weapons!
There are 28 one-syllable cards for him.
You have 20!
This is what I wanted...
What I could never explain...
The sound that comes before a sound forms...
I'm finally able to say I can hear it, too!
when I cannot bear growing any weaker than I already have.
A mountain stream...
when people and grass grow scarce
Crap! A fault!
Damn!
This is bad.
A fault this late in the match...
I'm in trouble!
Amakasu! Say something!
Don't let your opponent focus!
Say that she's encroaching on the playing field
or that there's a hair sticking out of her nose!
Now I know how it feels to be a reader!
I don't want to interfere!
as helpless autumn leaves are caught against the flow.
While autumn leaves...
Not when she's this focused!
His five-card lead is gone, just like that.
Damn, why do I have to play such a tough match?
This is all Retro's fault!
Retro's losing his own match!
Our ace against their ace.
Our number two against their number two.
Isn't that how we should win?!
Hokuo Academy is the strongest school in Tokyo!
That's what I want to show everyone!
Sudo-san is gone.
I'm the Hokuo ace now.
In every other sport I tried,
I was told that I could never be a starter,
but in my last summer here,
the members voted for me to lead them.
Said world grants no change, I pray,
Said world grants no change is a five-syllable card.
Chihaya-chan covered the Said world grants no escape card
on her side before attacking the opponent's side.
My body may be small,
but I can still cover my own cards against a girl.
I don't need a big lead.
One card is all it takes.
I'll still win in the end...
by playing karuta the Hokuo way.
Amakasu-kun is working hard.
I want him to be able to relax...
Why haven't Takuma and Kameda won yet?
I can tell my teammates are trying their best.
I can see that my opponent is worn down.
Why can't I pull ahead? What's wrong?
He was a weak amateur last year!
I need to finish this match quickly!
I lost to Takuma-kun by 15 cards, last year.
when the fisherman who casts his nets can seem dear.
All he remembers is that he crushed me.
He's not taking me seriously,
so he's placed all his cards to the lower right.
Impassionate gods...
Yes!
All four of them got it!
W-Wait!
Impassioned vows is still in play, so I was able to cover in time!
I touched the card first.
I moved around your hand to tap it from the side.
It's easier to bypass a right-handed cover with your left hand.
Was that his goal?!
Of course, Takuma-kun has played karuta much longer than I have.
However, in the year since I lost to him,
I've had more fun playing karuta than he has.
I just know it!
are joined at river's end.
Two cards left...
May the time spent in our one night together
Kana-chan has one card left.
Mashima, Ayase, and Desktomu-kun have two cards left.
Crazy...
I've never seen a match where four games were all this close.
All four may possibly come down to luck-of-the-draw.
The finals are incredible.
All four games are down to three cards total.
It's possible that we could see...
Crap!
Crap! Crap! Crap!
Mashima! Ayase! Desktomu-kun! Kana-chan!
Pay attention!
If all four of you are put in
luck-of-the-draw situations without realizing it, we'll lose!
We're guaranteed to lose!
bring a life of everlasting love.
I know that my heart...
N-No way!
Huh?! What?!
They moved so fast that I couldn't tell what happened.
Ayase-senpai, Mashima-senpai, and Komano-senpai won their cards.
I've never seen this happen before...
Four simultaneous luck-of-the-draws!
Uh, I'm moving The hazed early left.
Is he doing this because I'm left-handed?
I'm moving The fall paddy left.
Oh, sorry. I think I'll move it back.
No, that's not what they're trying to do!
Ayase! Please!
Look around you!
Thinking about which card to send
Don't look at the cards! Look around you!
Wait until Kana-chan has received hers!
Don't send your card yet!
but from the crystal white snow of Yoshino
I'm sending The hazed early.
They got us.
Hokuo...
In a luck-of-the-draw, the rule is to protect your own card.
Whoever's card is read, wins.
It's a 50-50 contest.
But in this situation...
Hokuo is good.
You can tell they're used to team matches.
They were able to split their cards.
Splitting your cards
is a strategy employed towards the end of a team match.
In a 5 vs. 5 team match, you only need three wins to win.
In other words, the team that already has one win
only needs two wins out of the luck-of-the-draw.
So to ensure victory, they made sure
that they have two of each of the remaining cards.
After I know that my heart was read,
Amakasu vs. Ayase
Takuma vs. Komano
Kinashi vs. Mashima Kameda vs. Oe
they casually told their teammates what their card was.
Uh, I'm moving The hazed early left.
I'm moving The fall paddy left.
Oh, sorry. I think I'll move it back.
They waited until they saw which card Chihaya-chan sent,
but from the crystal white snow of Yoshino
I'm sending The hazed early.
before setting everything up by sending the final card.
The hazed early The hazed early dawn light dawn light
The fall paddy The fall paddy
Now their cards are split.
As a team, they have two of each card,
so regardless of which card is read,
as long as they protect their own cards, they'll win.
It's a strategy that's borderline against the rules.
Oh, I should ask Tashiro-kun to provide a ruling.
Mizusawa should have tried for a 3 to 1 split.
The hazed early dawn light comes not from the moon
Then, it would have come down to luck.
They would have had a 50 chance of winning.
Hokuo wins
The fall paddy shacks have rough thatching
Mizusawa wins
Now, they can only win if they take an opponent's card.
Crap...
It's basically impossible for us to win now!
Only looking at her own cards Can't see the cards that are further away
We were unprepared...
I never thought this might happen.
Our lack of experience in team matches is showing!
This is the worst time for Hokuo's karuta experience to pay off!
Huh?
The hazed early dawn light
The fall paddy
The hazed early dawn light
The fall paddy
Does this mean...
No way! What do we do? What do we do?
What am I doing...
I told our first-year that I'd make him strong,
then I alone lost early on...
I'm pathetic!
They're all fighting! Giving their all!
This is all my fault!
Practicing swings that reach my side?
Is Ayase planning to attack her opponent's side?!
Mashima-senpai...
The hazed early dawn light and The fall paddy are on the field.
The empty cards that haven't been read are
Long, Impassioned Vows, Like the, The hazed field, The fall wind...
We can't move on The hazed or The fall.
It all comes down to the third syllable!
If The hazed early is read, Chihaya will take the opponent's card!
If The fall paddy is read, I'll take the opponent's card!
We're not giving up!
Mizusawa will take three wins!
We'll be the champions!
Long last we meet...
Like the sound of someone knocking on my door,
They're really trying to take the opponent's cards?
Mizusawa is serious about attacking...
This isn't a typical luck-of-the-draw.
Unlike Mizusawa, none of us need to attack the opponent's side.
We just have to focus on protecting our own cards.
It's impossible to penetrate that kind of defense!
Mashima must know that!
I'm taking it!
He has to!
I'm taking it!
The fall wind parts the wispy clouds
A fault...
One win for Mizusawa!
That wasn't just a simple mistake by Retro-kun.
Eyebrows' focus and unwavering persistence
pushed Retro-kun into that error.
Luck-of-the-draw isn't about luck.
Luck doesn't decide a match!
Each school has one win.
It's an even match now.
What the hell, Retro?!
First, you lied about your retrot cards.
Now, you made a mistake that ruined our perfect split!
What if we lose?!
How are you going to make up for this?!
I'll sock him.
The two remaining teams get to go to Nationals, right?
We don't need to try that hard, then.
I'll sock him.
I'll win...
I'll win and sock Retro hard!
The Hokuo ace is also practicing offensive swings.
He's going to attack.
Amakasu-kun...
Cover my card on The.
If the next syllable is fall, I attack.
If it's The hazed field, I cover,
and if it's The hazed early, I clamp down.
There's no such thing as a throw-away match!
We're Hokuo!
Hokuo wins!
Amakasu...
Be careful, Amakasu!
There are people...
to reveal moonlight, clear and bright.
capable of clearing their minds in this situation.
The hazed early dawn light comes not from the moon
Who got it?! Who got the card?!
I can't tell! They moved too fast!
Who got it?!
Who moved faster?!
It's mine! I moved faster!
No.
I touched it first!
No.
Ref!
No.
It was
at the same time.
Huh?
In that case, it goes to the side the card was on.
Amakasu-kun wins.
Thank you very much.
Hokuo Academy wins the Tokyo regional
over Mizusawa High School 3-2!
Thank you very much.
Wow, that was an incredible final.
That was exciting.
That was a once-in-a-decade kind of match.
Amakasu.
Is Hokuo the strongest team in Tokyo?
No.
On the last card, I only moved because I felt Ayase move.
If it had been The hazed field, I would have committed a fault.
I couldn't hear a thing.
After that match, I can't say that Hokuo is the strongest team.
Lame.
If you can't be the strongest team in Tokyo,
show me that you're the strongest team in Japan.
Sudo-san...
I'll be coming to watch on your budget.
Shouldn't we wake up Ayase?
Yes, the closing ceremony's about to begin.
E-Everyone! I'm sorry!
It's all because I screwed up!
Because I lost first!
Chihaya...
Th-That was fun!
That was the most fun we've had!
Five matches is really difficult.
Huh? Where's Tsukuba?
He said he was going somewhere with his brothers.
They're really close.
Guys! We start practicing for Nationals tomorrow!
Chihaya!
Let everyone rest for a day.
What?!
Huh? Aren't you going this way, Hanano-san?
Sorry, I have something to do.
What?! You want to join the Shiranami society!
All four of you?!
Really?!
Yes, please accept us.
What's a karuta society?
Can we become strong?
I'm gonna become a Master.
Oh, we meet again.
Will you be number five?
Bye!
We start practicing for Nationals in two days!
Oh, it's Arata!
An e-mail from Arata!
Did you have fun at the high school regional final?
Why are you crying?
It was really fun.
Arata.
That match was the most fun I've ever had,
and it was the most difficult loss I've ever had.
