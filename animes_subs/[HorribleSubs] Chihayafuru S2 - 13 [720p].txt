When winds blow, Chihaya-chan.
Chihaya-chan, when this poem was written 800 years ago,
they must have felt very refreshed.
the only sign of summer is the ritual purification in the waters
They could
probably hear the wind blow...
Silent waves creep closer to the Suminoe shore, and when night falls,
Got it!
Kana-chan,
I remember.
Speaking of dreams, there's Silent waves!
in my dreams, I creep closer to you
Megumu-chan...
Let's...
have a good match!
Chihaya Furu
Verse 13
In my dreams, I creep closer to you
I couldn't take the one-syllable card on
my opponent's lower right last time, but I got it this time.
The opponent's lower right one-syllable cards are always special.
You're taking a card from right under their nose.
It's so fun!
Ayase's got the momentum now.
That speed confirmed it.
The neural signal goes straight from Bellatrix's ears to her fingers.
That's the only way to explain her speed.
And another one-syllable S card,
Swift, was on the opponent's lower left,
but she went straight for Silent.
That takes guts!
That felt very clean.
I hit the corner.
I was never able to take a card that way before...
Chihaya-chan, that was a nice attack.
Yep!
The moment you celebrate, you lose your focus...
My own home is...
As the years pass...
No...
What a waste.
That was a waste.
As always...
Good, Megumu isn't letting it get to her.
She didn't let the loss of a one-syllable card
from her own side influence her play.
I can see why she was the West representative.
Akashi Girls' ace and moodmaker...
The match will be decided by Ousaka Megumu's performance.
One more card. Keep it going.
Yes!
I've never played anyone so calm before.
the sight of a midnight moon
I can't remember how to catch momentum.
So spring nights are short...
S-Same time...
Don't back down!
Fight for it!
I-I think I got that card...
Huh?
I'm not telling you to force her to give you the card.
Even if you end up losing it, the point is to make her feel uncomfortable.
Throw her off her game.
I'm sorry!
We touched it at the same time, so it should go to Megumu-chan...
I'm sorry!
Really? You can have it then.
What?!
She really gave it to me!
Oh, no! Oh, no! What do I do?!
So spring ends...
That was a failure.
She was the one who was thrown off her game.
She's not made to contest cards...
I need to step up.
I have to step up!
I must step up!
I have to...
The atmosphere and audience make it difficult for me to move.
A mountain stream...
An empty card!
That was close...
Hanano...
According to Hanano's notes,
the girl with a ponytail had a towel from an Aoi Ryuji tour.
Is that the towel she was talking about?
She actually recognized it?
Aoi Ryuji is a singer who's known for his sappy love songs.
Most of them are about broken hearts.
Which means...
These are the cards...
I know that my heart...
I have to take!
I wanted that card.
I heard that this person is Class C,
but he's tough!
I'm going to find my momentum in my first match today!
I defended that card!
Let's take the next one, Mizusawa!
Yes!
Hanano-san, you're very observant.
Thanks.
While it brings me no joy, the road beyond Mount Oe is too long
They did it!
Everyone got my While it brings card!
The momentum is shifting this time!
Momentum is when...
Momentum is when...
Simple-minded
After I heard...
She's so stable...
I got it!
Don't worry. Just start with one card.
Aim for that one card.
Yeah. Sorry, Megumu.
She's so composed, even on this stage.
Megumu is amazing.
But I've been with her for a such a long time
and I still don't understand what she's thinking.
I got everyone excited about making her Queen,
but how does she really feel about it?
Does she want to become Queen?
Chihaya isn't able to take consecutive cards.
Her deficit is growing steadily.
Chihaya, you just have to win.
Bring home the win!
Did I say the wrong thing again?
This is different from last year.
A year has passed...
A whole year.
on a long September night, and then I saw a dawn moon
The sky is the road home for the holy maidens,
An empty card.
She moved immediately, but she was still able to pull back.
Impressive...
She didn't fall for Ousaka-san's quick reach.
Oh, excuse me.
Good Luck Megumu
She's savoring the moment!
This is the glory of youth!
That headband is now an Ousaka Megumu trademark!
She used to be the only one who wore one...
I made these for Nationals.
Let's all wear them.
Huh?
This is to thank you for the one you made me.
Megumu-senpai...
A beautiful display of friendship!
I'm so glad to be a karuta advisor!
The reason we worship Megumu-tan
is because of the gap in her behavior.
Our lenses know the truth.
Whew, I'd look pretty dumb wearing a headband by myself.
It was a good idea to have everyone else join in.
Swoon!
may the wind bring clouds to extend their stay
The storm will soon carry...
She went below my hand.
She took it.
She'd been losing all of the The cards,
but that was a clean win.
Has she figured out something?
That was...
Okay, on to the next card.
One card at a time.
Yes!
This is a team match,
so why am I the only one saying anything?
Queen?
Not interested.
I'm sending a card.
fades to reveal fishing nets in the shallows
What? The hazed early dawn mist?
That's a long multi-syllable card.
Why?
Normally, no one would send that.
Multi-syllable cards are supposed to be a weakness for her.
Is she sacrificing that card?
so I wish for a memory of you to take with me
For you, I would have given up my life
A different multi-syllable card!
Megumu?
The speed when she took that one-syllable card...
The way she broke my cover...
I will become Queen!
I'm not interested in becoming Queen,
but I have to beat her now.
Swoon!
She broke her opponent's cover.
There are plenty of players who can
take certain cards really fast.
To win, you have to overcome
your weaknesses instead of relying on your strengths.
How much time has she spent practicing?
My point is that you're too sloppy about covering your cards.
Like this!
How many times do I have to repeat myself?
You'll never become Queen if you can't conquer your weaknesses!
now together, I guard it dear
I did it...
You'll do better if you listen carefully before moving.
I'll help you.
I did it,
everyone.
I did it.
I have to beat her.
The momentum...

I hear the beating of cloth...
Got it!
I protected mine!
Same here!
Ditto!
All right!
A-Again...
She couldn't take three in a row.
Megumu-tan celebrated...
Megumu-tan isn't telling her team to focus on the next card.
Interesting...
This is a high level, back and forth game.
I'm pleasantly surprised.
She's got good game sense,
and a broad field of vision to boot.
She's watching every card.
No matter what I do, she's always perfectly calm.
I'm sending a card.
fades to reveal fishing nets in the shallows
She's returning that multi-syllable card.
Th-This is getting good.
That girl's gotta be a sadist.
The hazed early dawn mist over the Kawagiri River
The card she just sent?!
She was able to set up a low cover on my side.
That was bad.
I know how to keep people from breaking my cover.
I've been practicing with everyone to beat the Queen.
I'm not interested in becoming Queen though.
But I have to win to make everyone happy.
I have to beat you now.
Is she mad?
She's strong.
I still have work to do on multi-syllable cards...
It's tough.
However, I've realized something, Dr. Harada...
It seems like there are more people watching our match now.
Akashi Girls'...
I thought that Ousaka Megumu was the only threat they had.
I was a little excited about my first match against an all-girls school.
May I see you never forget...
She's strong!
As strong as a boy!
Ousaka is our engine,
but the other girls have also improved.
After all, they've been practicing with Ousaka to help make her Queen.
It's possible to become this good if you're motivated.
Akashi Girls' is now a team that's improving themselves for Ousaka's sake.
Youth... It brings a tear to my eye...
Megumu stopped providing vocal support.
Is her opponent that good?
The storm blasts...
I was a moment late.
I need to do better... I need to do better...
One millimeter...
One spot...
The green border...
Feel sorrow wash...
I don't remember her having such a fast motion.
Ousaka moved before she did, but she still took it.
That reminded me of...
Megumu-chan...
Megumu-chan is me.
Stop taking cards with your speed.
She's who I'd be if someone hadn't taught me better.
though autumn is not mine alone
A night spent waiting...
The emotions experienced...
She finally took three consecutive cards.
There's nothing flashy about her swing,
but it's accurate.
My lead...
My lead is almost gone!
Okay!
One card!
One card at a time!
I was too loud!
I'm not used to this kind of thing.
Yu-chan...
The sight of the lonely moon...
She swung that hard on an empty card?
She might as well be a guy...
Too manly!
Megumu,
I don't know what you're thinking.
It's possible that you don't care about becoming Queen,
and you just wanted to have fun with everyone,
but...
Megumu, I'll secure our first win,
so you can take it easy.
I still don't know what Megumu is thinking.
Queen...
Scary...
Tough...
Bad...
I'll be playing in the Queen match qualifier this year.
After all...
After all, how can you not enjoy becoming stronger?
Megumu-tan, you're a very gentle girl.
You want to make everyone happy.
You want to fulfill their expectations.
We know that you're working hard for those reasons.
But honestly,
we want to see you succumb to your own desires.
As I wait...
We touched it at the same time!
All right!
Trit-Trot
That was mine...
It was mine.
I won that card.
Trit-Trot
But we touched it at the same time, and it was on my side...
I was faster.
I could tell.
What? But...
No, I won that.
Megumu...
I was slightly faster!
You can take it then.
She doesn't know how to contest a card, period!
I knew it
Don't be ridiculous, Yu-chan.
The leader of this team is me.
The person who can make everyone happy is me.
The one who will challenge the Queen
is me!
What?
What?
I've never seen Megumu like this before...
I gave up the card she contested,
but that makes up for the earlier one.
It's fine, Ayase.
Just be your usual self.
Okay...
Time to attack!
Mizusawa!
Yeah!
Okay, one card!
One card!
One card at a time!
Y-Yes!
Everyone's watching our match.
The two teams are even.
The tension...
The pressure between the two teams is clashing.
