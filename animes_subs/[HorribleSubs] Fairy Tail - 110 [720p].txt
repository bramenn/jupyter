After being separated all of a sudden from Cana,
I was thrown into a battle with one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory, Kain Hikaru.
Natsu and I joined the battle halfway, but Natsu didn't really get a chance to shine.
Oh, shut up!
But with the new special move I came up with, we raked a big white dumpling over the coals!
Special move, sure...
Pull harder!
I'm pulling as hard as I can!
Aye!
And wait... Can't you just break the rocks with your fire, Natsu?
Good thinking!
Jeez...
Light and darkness, mixed together...
The ones who will lead the way to the shining red tomorrow...
Fairies or Demons...
Whose hearts will it be?
Magic blades?
She can summon weapons as well?
Go.
Juvia's body is made of water!
No matter the attack, Juvia will not...
Juvia!
Juvia's body made of water... was injured?
My blades attack the sense of pain directly.
In other words, they are sensory blades.
That magic power...
I see.
You must be one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory.
I do not deem answering that as necessary.
Wipe out the enemy. That is my mission.
Dead-End of Despair.
He's gone!
Zeref was here?
He's been taken away already!
What's with this smell?
She must have spread something around.
I can't follow her like this...
I've gotta search for Cana, too!
Why are you lifting your leg?
Happy!
Crap... Maybe I'll take a nap?
Don't do that.
I'm worried about Cana too...
Lucy-san, I'm sorry...
It's like I just explained.
They're trying to use Zeref to change the world!
Change the world, huh?
That's just way over-the-top.
I wanna live in a world that's just full of fish!
Um, it's not like that.
But see here...
I'm gonna make sure to finish this.
They hurt Gramps.
Those guys better not think I'll let them off this island.
Off the island?
That's it! They must have a ship somewhere!
That woman from before said something about bringing Zeref back to their master, right?
There's a good chance that their ship is anchored somewhere around here.
Zeref is being taken there!
Happy, search for their ship from the sky!
Looks... like I'm out of magic power.
Then I guess you're just a widdle kitty cat...
In that case, how about we go back to where Wendy and Gramps is...
We can ask Carla and Lily.
This is Route E, where the first test of the exam took place.
The grave of Mavis, the founding master of Fairy Tail, is somewhere in here.
I'll climb into first place.
I'll pass.
I'll become an S class wizard.
So I can see him...
So I can tell him...
Light...
Damn it, they never show up when you search for'em...
Where are these 7 Kin of Purgatory guys?
And that Cana sure was in a foul mood.
Did she run out of booze and...
Wait.
Now that I think about it, I haven't seen her drink since we got to Tenroujima.
Is she going cold turkey?
I sense someone...
Soon, you'll return to being the true king, Zeref...
Zeref? That man she's carrying on her shoulder?
Ul!
No... Grimoire Heart... She's my enemy!
She looks like her... Like my teacher, Ul.
Who the hell is she?
This is wondrous!
You seem to be in quite the good mood, old man.
3 of my 7 Kin of Purgatory have been defeated, it seems.
Those spawn of Makarov's have done quite well!
Then, is it my turn?
No, no... This is not a battle for you to join, Bluenote.
I would like to be able to play around a little bit.
I cannot let my body go soft.
Will you stop that?
What? If I sink the ship, then they won't be able to find it, right?
It's better to expose them.
Makarov's brood will gather here,
unaware they've fallen inside the demon's maw...
Can't you eat any prey that hasn't been led into your mouth?
I will head out for my meal.
You will stay here.
Where you go, the land will rage.
Stay calm.
The kids are down to four... Almost half.
If another falls... I'm heading out.
Today seems like a day I can stretch my wings...
Bluenote Stinger?!
The man who singlehandedly destroyed the Blue Dragon Regiment
led by Commander Ghora during the Cabria war...
The great wizard who is said not to even leave weeds in his wake...
A big fish like that was in Grimoire Heart?
They are no longer an opponent that we can handle ourselves.
And the same goes for Fairy Tail, of course.
Let us contact headquarters at once.
This is now beyond our purview.
Give me a little time.
What are you...?
Dranbalt-sama!
He even took the communications lacrima with him!
We'll be late contacting headquarters now!
What in the world are you thinking, Dranbalt?!
Elsewhere in a corner of Tenroujima is Makarov,
who was gravely injured by Hades in a fierce battle.
Wendy, Lily, and Carla are looking after him, while waiting for Natsu to return.
Wendy!
Natsu-san!
Lucy-san, too!
How's the Master doing?
I can't tell yet...
His wounds are just too severe, I suppose.
But it's strange... I don't sense that his life is in danger.
Maybe there's some secret to this so-called Sacred Ground...
It's you!
Where'd you run off to, jerk?
He's Mest, from the Magic Council.
My real name is Dranbalt.
Dranbalt-san?
You don't need to worry, Wendy.
I've come to rescue you!
With my magic, I can evacuate just the Fairy Tail members from this island.
If you can figure out where everyone is somehow...
Gonna have to pass on that.
Why do we have to ask the Magic Council to save us, huh?
This is a problem for our guild, and we're gonna deal with these guys ourselves.
That's not it!
If headquarters finds out what's going on,
there's a good chance they'll fire on the island!
They're gonna shoot Etherion again?!
Don't you guys ever learn?
Etherion? What's that?
I've heard rumors...
It's some destructive magic that's seriously powerful.
It struck us while we were at the Tower of Heaven!
I-I'm impressed you're alive...
Well, a lot happened.
I'm not sure of the details, but if I recall, lacrima absorbed it all.
This guild just faces crises wherever it goes, doesn't it?
If they fire that on us now...
We can't be sure what will happen, can we?
Then we just have to finish things up first.
Makarov's down! And Grimoire Heart still has fearsome people left!
There's no way you can win!
Hey, now... So that's why you're gonna blow up the whole island?
This island is our guild's sacred ground!
The grave of the founding master is here, too!
I couldn't take you attacking this place...
I can't believe this!
If you do that, you won't get away with it!
We're gonna protect the guild!
Trying to threaten us? The Magic Council?
You're just some wizard guild!
Now listen carefully, you!
I don't give a crap whether it's Grimoire Heart or the Magic Council.
Anyone who lays a hand on our guild is the enemy.
I'll destroy them all!
This air... I feel a storm coming.
Juvia!
Putting aside the fact we used up our magic power for the exam,
I can't believe we're having such a hard time when it's two against one!
Number 13.
Stand back. I will defeat her.
Erza Scarlet... You are number 4.
Number 4 of what?
The fourth most important member to kill, by my reckoning.
Foolishness.
It is quite important.
Why are you aiming for Juvia?!
Number 13 is weak trash,
so better to clean it up first!
Juvia is...
Hang in there, Juvia!
Number 3 is Gildarts, but he no longer seems to be on the island.
Number 2 is Makarov, however he seems to have been defeated by Lord Hades.
The master is number 2?!
Are you saying there's someone more important than the master?
Number 1 is Gray.
Gray Fullbuster!
What?
Why Gray?
He's... the man who killed Ultear's mother.
He caused Ultear to suffer!
He's the man who hurt my Ultear!
I'll never forgive him! I'll tear him limb from limb!
Drat!
Never forgive?
That is Juvia's line.
Whose life were you planning to take, was it?
What's with her? She's only number 13.
C-Calm down, Juvia!
Calm... down?
This woman is aiming for Gray-sama.
And for some irrational reason.
Um, but...
Do you think... Juvia can stay calm?
Juvia will never forgive this girl!
Water Nebula!
Juvia...
She's like a totally different person than the one I fought during the exam.
Her strong feelings for her loved one become her strength...
This is Juvia's true power...
Erza-san, please leave this to Juvia!
Hurry and find Wendy and the others. And Gray-sama, as well.
Understood.
I'll leave this to you!
I won't let number 4 get away!
Maguilty Lese!
Water Slicer!
It's raining...
Where are you headed?
Their main camp?
Where Grimoire Heart's master is?
The tears put out of mind my own desires...
The evil-eye wriggles impatiently in the darkness.
Is that from some song, Rusty?
Oh, no...
Just the scream of a shattered heart.
Azuma, you're quite beat up. For you.
Proof that I fought someone strong.
Someone strong?
That won't do at all. There isn't anyone like that in this guild.
My heart's fragment wavers not.
You mustn't underestimate Fairy Tail.
Their weapon is not their magic power,
but the ability to turn their conviction into a blade...
Conviction into a blade?
Seems very much like our Meldy...
Strange.
Even though it's the same human, Gray...
One of us holds hatred,
and the other holds love.
Though it's the same person, the different feelings cause him to be seen differently.
It's natural.
A symbol of individuality.
It's what makes us human.
I am lucky.
I came here for the purpose of killing Gray.
And I was able to meet with a person who feels strongly for Gray.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Your feelings for Gray will kill him!
Juvia... I will show you a little bit of heaven, and a great sea of despair!
Now, think of him!
Picture the one you love...
Gray-sama...
There!
Sense Link!
What's this pain?
Lost Magic.
Maguilty Sense!
W-What have you done?
Juvia and Gray's senses are now one.
I can only connect them if one's feelings for the other is strong enough.
J-Juvia and Gray-sama are... one?!
Your senses, anyway.
What is it now?
I'm all light headed all of a sudden?
Feels good, doesn't it?
Your two senses are fully linked together.
Juvia is in heaven!
Juvia will die in agony!
But, this magic only shares pain!
All the pain you experience is felt by Gray.
No...
You're trying to hurt Gray-sama?!
Impossible...
Her magic power continues to rise?
She was this powerful?
Her feelings are giving her strength.
Then I'll show you the power of feelings myself!
Three Spread Sense Link!
Why is Juvia hurt too?
W-What in the world?
If it's for Ultear... I don't need this life of mine!
I used you as a relay, and now I am linked to my target.
Juvia, Gray, and my senses are all linked together.
Now, no matter which one of us dies, Gray will die, too!
This is the dead-end of despair.
The dead-end of Gray's life!
Love is a heart of affection.
What's wrong, Happy?
Love is the feeling of wanting to protect someone dear to you.
Hey!
Hello?
Are you listening, Happy?
Love is an overflowing passion!
The two, lead to a fateful encounter, their feelings deeply entwined, play a single tune together.
I've got fish?
Ooh, Carla's over there!
Truly a love swimphony!
This isn't working.
His head's gone off somewhere.
Next time: Love and the Tears of Vigor.
Screwed it up, Happy.
I-I didn't mispronounce it! I was just twalking wike a nwative!
Sure, fine, got it. Just slow down there.
