Big Brother!
Y-You sure like to get up close and personal, Alice.
Stare...
I wanted to share in your good fortune, as well!
You were accepted into the Hero Academy, after all!
R-Right...
You're basically the head of our household now!
Alice, don't say that! My dignity!
F-Father!
I need to talk to you about the Hero Academy.
You see, there's an enrollment fee...
Enrollment fee?
I have some money saved up. How much is it?
Three hundred thousand rels.
Three hundred...
Within a week.
A week...
Will a year work?
Very well. I'll earn the money myself.
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
My poor, unfortunate brother.
Three hundred thousand rels to get into the school, eh?
That's probably a bit harsh for a poor noble like you.
I don't think you needed to be that blunt about it, but yeah.
Then why don't you fight some rare monsters in this dungeon and sell them off?
I'd rather not bring that much attention to myself.
Especially after the entrance exam.
Could you just say it was you who defeated the Dead Reaper?
What?
People would have an easier time believing the daughter of an earl defeated it
than the son of a baronet.
Very well. I'll say that I defeated it.
Thanks.
I ended up letting my vain classmate take the credit for it.
Then I guess there's only one way.
Work at the adventurers' guild.
E-Excuse me...
What?
Sir, please don't intimidate the newbie.
I'm the receptionist, Lola.
Is this your first time at the adventurers' guild?
First, allow me to explain the very simple system we use here.
S-Sure.
There are many prominent adventurers who belong to Odin.
We have adventurers harvest plants,
cull monsters, explore dungeons, and complete various other quests.
Adventurers have ranks, which affect the quests they can take
Master
Newbie
and the rewards they receive.
Of course, those who show consistent results may rank up.
In order to join the guild, we'll need you to register.
Oh, sure. That'll be fine.
First, I'll need you to write down all the skills you currently have.
My skills?
Have no fear.
All that information will be classified with the guild.
She smells so nice...
I wrote them all down.
Er, Noir...
Y-Yes?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't kid around.
We don't have an endless supply of paper.
Oh, right. O-Of course.
I'm sure Get Creative and Editor probably sound pretty weird.
No, I'm aware of those skills.
Because...
This is Odin, the guild that Olivia Servant was a member of.
What?! Master was in this guild?
Master?
Crap! I let the cat out of the bag.
We do get people like you every now and then...
People who claim to be Olivia's successor.
In that case...
Let's find out the truth.
When you touch this Discerning Tome, your skills appear in writing.
Well? What will it be?
You still have a chance to take back what you said.
Oh, no. I'll go ahead and do this.
Huh?
But what happens if I'm not lying?
Well...
How about I lift up my skirt and say, I'm terribly sorry, Lord Noir.
Well, if you're sure...
Noir Stardia 16 years old Level 33 Skills: Great Sage Get Creative Editor Bestow LP Conversion Stone Bullet Discerning Eye
S-So you're really...
Olivia's s-s-s-successor?!
So, what were you going to do again?
Weren't you supposed to say, Lord Noir, I love you?
While lifting up your skirt.
L-Lord Noir...
I-I love you...
Noir Stardia
So, what kind of quest would you like?
You'll have to start at Rank E.
She got over that fast!
Actually, I need to get 300,000 rels in a week.
In that case...
How about catching these?
Rainbow grasshoppers?
Their habitat is known,
but they're super rare bugs that are seldom seen, right?
This was a D-Rank quest,
but we started taking E-Rank applicants, as well.
So I'm guessing you couldn't find anyone to take the quest...
Correct. But, Noir, you have a useful skill
that should help you out.
Oh, you're right.
Good luck, Noir. I have very high hopes for you.
I find capable men very attractive.
I-It's hard to believe she doubted me a few moments ago...
The grasshoppers' habitat should be around here.
If I use the Great Sage skill that answers any question,
I should be able to find them quickly.
But kisses are absolutely necessary to avoid the headache side effect.
Wait. If I use Get Creative to make Headache Immunity...
Headache Immunity
That's so much!
But I can't always rely on Emma...

Okay, that should do it.
Great Sage, where are the rainbow grasshoppers?
The closest one to this location is 310 meters to the south, behind a boulder.
Yeah, it definitely hurts.
But... it's not unbearable.
Sweet. I found it pretty quickly.
But headaches seriously suck.
It'd be nice to just have Emma here with me...
Noir, you doofus!
Emma! Perfect timing, as always!
And your boobs are still...
Noir, you became an adventurer?!
H-How'd you find out about that?
I went to your house, and they said you went to the guild.
Then I went to the guild, and...
Actually, the details don't matter!
How could you do this without talking to me first?
S-Sorry. I thought it might be too dangerous for you.
Ugh! Don't you remember our promise from six years ago?
Six years ago?
When we were playing together
and I yelled, We'll be together forever, until death do us part?
Yeah. So I'll look for these grasshoppers with you!
You'll be using Great Sage, right?
So, you know...
Oh, you don't have to kiss me anymore. I learned Headache Immunity.
Huh?!
B-But, I mean, it's basically a greeting, so you can give me one anytime.
And we've been friends forever.
And even with the immunity, I still get a slight headache...
R-Really? In that case...
O-Okay.
Though, honestly, this headache is quite manageable.
Thank you for your patience.
I have your 250,000 rels here.
T-Two hundred and fifty thousand?!
Yes. At this rate, you'll rank up in no time.
G-Great.
So you're capable and hardworking.
You truly are a fine gentleman.
And because you're such a fine gentleman, I have another quest for you.
It's a quest to take care of some monsters.
Th-Thank you very much.
Feel free to ask me any questions you might have.
Hang on a second!
I'm going to become an adventurer so I can come with you on this quest, Noir.
Y-Your boobs...
You? An adventurer?
The name's Emma Brightness. Noir and I have been friends since we were kids.
Th-This can't be good...
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter.
C-Calm down, you two.
I'm in charge of Noir. He is a valuable partner.
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't interfere.
That's my line. We're together forever, until death do us part.
What's going on?
Are they having a lovers' spat?
Yeah! Fight more!
W-Well, this turned into a spectacle...
Emma! I'm so blessed to have you help me out!
R-Really?
And Lola, I'll do whatever it takes to give you the best results I can!
Oh, my.
I guess that's enough for today.
Yeah, I'll back off.
On behalf of Mr. Noir's looks.
On behalf of Noir's looks.
Aw, man.
They're done already?
Well, that was no fun.
Be safe out there.
Let's have dinner off the clock sometime.
Huh? I, uh...
You seriously had the nerve to do that right in front of me?!
Noir, you doofus. Don't you know girls can be conniving?
Go to dinner with her, and she'll drag you into a room and...
A-And...?
Maybe she'll dissect you.
N-No way!
Hey, there's a patch of grass missing.
I wonder if it's because the Big Rabbit that we're after ate some.
Yeah...
Apparently those rabbits are disrupting the ecosystem.
We'll get 50,000 rels if we get rid of them.
Goblins?
What are their levels?
Goblin
The same as Emma. In that case...
Let's fight, Emma!
Yeah! I'll take the one on the right!
Goblin Lv. 17
Sex: Male
It's male.
Then I'll use Stone Bullet!
As a fellow guy, I feel for you, but...
Sorry, my dude!
Okay, now to back up Emma.
Noir, look!
A B-Big Rabbit!
Big Rabbit
Level 24.
S-Stand back, Emma!
Stay out of this. I'll defeat that thing myself.
What? But why?
Because...
If you do all the work, that girl's going to be all over you again!
It's so fast for its size!
But Emma's even faster!
Yeah...
She's like a butterfly dancing on the wind.
You're way too slow.
All right, let's do this!
Wind Strike!
Wh-Whoa!
One more!
It jumped?!
I-I made it in time...
Emma! This way!
L-Let's regroup here.
It'll probably come looking for us soon.
We need to figure out how to deal with that thing.
Why couldn't I defeat it?
I kept slicing at it.
Maybe its skin was too thick and you just couldn't reach its vital point.
I'm so weak...
Emma...
She's actually depressed about this.
There must be something I can do.

If I use 500 right now, I might be in trouble.
H-Hey...
I could make you stronger.
R-Really?!
Yeah, but there's something that I need in return.
I-If It'll help me defeat the rabbit, I'll do anything!
Okay, then...
Can I nibble on your ear?
Huh?!
I-I promise I won't bite hard...
No?
S-Sure. Do whatever you want with me.
Emma...
Don't hold back!
I sure won't!
Wow... I didn't know ears were so soft.
Noir... Are you done yet?
Maybe her ears are sensitive.
We've been friends forever,
but I guess there's still a lot I don't know about her.
N-No!
It spotted us!
Hurry... Hurry!
I need that LP!
Noir Stardia
I'm topped off!

Huh?
It's to thank you... for making me stronger!
Th-This is truly... proof that you completed your quest.
Did you really do this on your own?
Yes! Emma took down the Big Rabbit all on her own!
Lola...
Um... Thank you.
I gained some confidence because of this quest.
Oh, no... I apologize for my prior rudeness.
Congratulations on completing your quest.
Oh, hey. I heard that Big Rabbit flesh is delicious.
Yes. It's hard to come by.
I hear adventurers eat the meat right after they defeat them.
Well, you see, I happened to created a skill called Pocket Dimension
that allows me to store large items in another dimension.
Let's all have some together.
Whoa!
That's great!
You're amazing at your job and considerate...
How wonderful.
You're the best, Noir!
It smells wonderful!
There's plenty more!
It's so good!
This is the best!

Oh, thank you very much.
Looks like you have enough for your enrollment fee now.
Congratulations on getting accepted to the school.
Congratulations!
Good luck at Hero Academy!
Congrats on getting in!
Cheers! Congrats!
Wait... What is this?
It's like a dream... How did this happen?
Cheers to the adventurers of Odin!
Just call us if you need any help.
You should join my party next time!
What changed me?
How did I become stronger?
Who do I thank for this?
Oh, right.
This is all...
Noir, everyone's waiting to hear you speak!
Right.
Everyone, thank you so much!
It's all thanks to you, Master!
I'll come see you again...
Very soon.
Or, you know...
You could come see me right now!
Next time, The Troubled Classmate.
