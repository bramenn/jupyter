Why am I in this crowd?
No no, if I make it through there's a mountain of dojinshi waiting for me.
Based on the ones I saw in Akihabara and in the club office...
Sasahara.
Sasahara.
This is your first Comic Fest?
Uh, yeah...
You look tired, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay...
I've just been over-excited since yesterday, and it's worn me out...
It's still too early to be tired.
That's true...
Kohsaka stands out...
But still...
Is it 100 otaku in here?
Genshiken
I woke up and as usual forgot my cell and missed the Express.
My life reflected in the train window.
I'm sure I have something that I won't lose to anyone in Japan...
I can't run fast, though.
I'm not that strongly-built.
Here I go, at my dauntless pace.
Pass away, today's sadness, raining in the sun!
Hesitation, repetition, dreaming all night, all night.
Farewell sadness, to outer space you go!
Look to the sky and shout at the top of your lungs!
At this tempo!
Right now, at this tempo!
Genshiken Right now, at this tempo!
International Exhibition Hall Station
The foreboding of a storm...
M-Madarame's getting into character s-so don't mind him.
Oh...
We took the first train, so why are so many people lined up already?
They've been here all night, of course.
I-Isn't that prohibited?
Besides, it's such bad weather...
A storm, in fact.
Oh...
Well, it's not like I'd want to go that far.
I-lf Kasukabe were here she wouldn't understand a word of this.
No, I don't think she'd realize she was missing anything.
Ugh, high humidity.
Why's the air so hot?
It sure is hot.
Oh yeah!
Why are you so cheerful?
This bad weather makes it feel like a real event.
It's times like this when things like religious experiences happen!
You think so?
Religious experiences aside, this weather is a rare thing.
Y-You're right.
Recently it's been otherwise, but in the past...
Wow, is that so...
Yes!
I get the feeling something will happen today!
Something divinely inspired!
You lost me...
Stop and go, what a drag!
But we're definitely making progress.
I've got a total runner's high.
Huh?
The world of light!
Running in place is depressing.
Why not go actually run for a bit?
We'll keep your place in line.
Good idea!
Are you serious?
Just kidding, I'd never mess up the line like...
M-Madarame, are you all right?
He's embarrassed.
This could become legendary.
Yeah, um, well...
Am I in trouble?
It's sprained...
No, broken...
But at least my fingers move, and it doesn't feel like it's snapped...
I need to hit the corporate booths before dojinshi today!
My first priority is to get my hands on the commemorative limited edition...
All you have to do is line up for them!
I can do it!
Piece of cake!
I just need to get to them...
You sure got quiet.
Of c-course, he's embarrassed.
Good, I'll go as far as I can, to the divine domain!
It feels like I can reach heaven!
The exhibit hall is currently terribly crowded.
Please do not rush, but walk slowly and carefully.
We thank you for your cooperation.
Posters, pencil boards...
Would it be best to check what the trading cards are now?
B-Before that let's get in the card-only line.
If it's there, we can always g-get out.
That's true.
Madarame?
We're going.
Uh, yeah.
I-I don't have t-today's rare card.
Neither do I.
Or me...
W-Well, I'll sort them so gather them up.
What about you, Madarame?
Sorry, Sasahara, look for me.
What?
It turns out I twisted my wrist when I fell.
Are you all right?
Is it swollen?
Well, I haven't looked...
Anyway you look at it, that's a sprain, or maybe even worse...
You think so too?
I even forgot to act like Tetsuo.
Huh?
In any case, you should hurry to Medical...
I'm okay, I'm okay...
I can stay...
Here.
Well, if you say so...
There it is...
The rare card.
I have seen God.
You can stop now...
Man, that's brave...
Brave and risky...
Are y-you seriously okay, Madarame?
It gradually hurts less and less...
I-Isn't that bad?
Come on, here's where it really begins!
We're finally at the east hall!
But...
Y-You can't shop with that hand, can you?
Right, so...
I'll stick close behind Sasahara, he's just the right height...
If I like something he looks at, he can buy two copies and I'll pay him later.
Just choose stuff you're into!
I still don't like this.
Sasahara, think about this.
If you took the first subway train...
I don't think you've gotten through the injury yet.
This thing's gone numb now anyway.
We'll pretend we didn't see that.
Like hell!
Let's go.
Oh, excuse me.
W-What a clown.
Madarame...
Hold on, this really looks serious!
S-S-S-Sasahara, g-get a staffer!
Hmm, he's out.
I guess his brain finally cut out on him, like a breaker...
He was pushing too hard after all.
I'll g-go with him.
Oh, that's all right, I'll go.
No, you won't!
You're awake?
Don't bother.
You guys buy dojinshi.
Two copies of the good ones.
I'll pay you later...
I'm counting on you!
Please don't speak.
You'll bite your tongue.
You actually see people on stretchers quite a bit...
But you never expect it to be someone you know.
W-Well, from here we split up and do our own shopping.
All right...
This is our meeting place.
All right, then I'll be going.
Good luck.
Come back alive.
Please don't talk like Madarame.
Madarame mentioned it before...
So that does happen...
Lots of dojin shops won't let you flip through...
But then it's not like there's anyone to blame if you don't like it...
Ahh, there I go thinking too much.
One copy, please.
700 Yen.
Oh, a book about Kujiun's Miss President?
Please, Miss President.
And it's my kind of art style... Please, Miss President.
But, no one else is looking at them...
Darn it! What is there to be embarrassed about?
Didn't I train for this at the dojin shops?
Besides, we're all the same here...
Um, is it all right if I browse?
F-Feel free.
All righty...
One copy, no, two copies please.
That comes to 1000 Yen.
Ah, forgive me, ancestors...
Here I am in this place when I haven't even visited your graves yet this year.
International Exhibition Hall Station
Hello...
Sure, see you later.
She doesn't think she can make it past the station, so she's going home.
N-Not bad for Kasukabe.
Right.
Thank you for posing.
Thanks a lot.
Excuse me, please look this way.
Look this way too, please.
Would you mind posing with your fingers interlaced?
Like this?
Thank you!
Thank you very much.
Okay, here we go.
Cool, thank you much.
These are the pictures from last time.
Thanks as always.
Are you sure it's all right, Fukuro?
It's all right, it's all right.
Did I buy too much, though?
This is heavy...
Student Council of Darkness - 500 Yen
Now I've completely blended in.
I'll take one.
Anywhere you look here, we're all the same.
Hey, he came here with a girl?
You can't be yourself that way!
What's with him, lookin' all cool?
Why don't you dress for the occasion?
Kujiun Parody - 700 Yen
I'll buy it!
I'll buy it! Met Warrior- 700 Yen
I'll buy this too! Project K - 1000 Yen
I'll buy any book about her!
Uh-oh, I feel like something on top of my head is starting to crack open...
Something on top of my head...
Sasahara!
Oh, aren't you...
Why are you...
I'm also with the Manga Club, you see.
Then this is the Manga Club's booth?
Komaki 3 - Komaki 4
Oh neat! You make dojinshi?
I'll buy some.
No, just take one.
What?
Here's the latest one.
Uh, no...
I'll pay for it.
I'm giving it to you.
Here, give it a read.
Okay, thank you very much.
Is this really legit?
The other members aren't saying anything...
Come on around behind the table.
Let's talk a bit.
Are you sure?
You can fit through that gap over there.
Right...
Have a seat.
Right...
It sure is hot.
Yeah...
Is this really kosher?
If I sit down it means someone else has to stand.
For that matter, they're all facing away and ignoring us.
Are you sure about this, Haraguchi?
So, are things in your price range?
Well, I couldn't afford big corporate stuff so I went for smaller groups.
Ah, but you didn't have a chance with the bigwigs, anyway...
If you're serious about buying, you need to be here...
I see, is it that much better?
Well, yeah, but I guess Genshiken could never manage it.
I mean, is Genshiken currently producing anything?
They aren't, are they?
Let me tell you about Genshiken.
About ten years ago, they formed as a composite circle...
But on the contrary, what exactly they do became blurry and vague.
Besides, nowadays all circles are borderless.
So in conclusion, the existence of Genshiken is valueless.
That's why it's made up primarily of wanna-bes.
The only one who can even remotely draw is Kugayama.
But it's just doodles, nothing print-worthy...
Madarame talks like he's a military otaku...
Tanaka does cosplay...
Cosplay...
It's just, you know...
And that Kohsaka kid?
What's his deal?
His interests are definitely an otaku's...
What an odd guy.
I wouldn't know.
In any case, Genshiken is a bunch of lukewarm losers year after year.
They don't amount to anything on their own.
Why not quit now and join the Manga Club?
But Haraguchi, aren't you part of both clubs?
In name only, really.
I attended at first, but once I knew what they were about I stopped going.
Oh, that reminds me.
The chairman has held his position since I was a freshman.
What year do you suppose he is?
Got me.
Well, the group's just right for me at least.
Oh yeah?
That's too bad.
Ah, yes.
This conversation was confidential, so don't disclose it to anyone else.
Oh, by the way, did you draw anything in the book you gave me?
I'm something of an editor, so I have to be the one who keeps everyone in line.
Oh...
How're they selling?
Not bad...
I feel sorry for the Manga Club guys...
Now I get it...
The reason no one looks pleased about Haraguchi's name...
At this time, Comic Festival 66 Summer is now coming to an end.
Sorry I took so long.
H-Hi, y-you really stuck to it.
Yeah, I had trouble choosing...
D-Did you buy anything for Madarame?
Yes, I tried buying several books for him.
Oh! That one's by the fan circle he's secretly into.
I d-did think your t-tastes overlapped, but this is unexpected...
I'm not sure if I'm happy about that.
I b-bought this.
T-This is pretty good.
I-Isn't it?
The art's pretty good, and it's s-sexy.
So Sasahara, how was your first Comic Fest?
Yeah, like Kohsaka said before, I really do fit in with Genshiken...
Ah...
It wore me out.
I'll b-bet, especially with all that happened today.
Very true.
B-But, it's not over yet.
What?
You line up to go home, too.
Save me!
We took no detours or shortcuts...
Only vivid dreams extended deep into the shadows.
We aren't quite grown up.
Simple but complicated glistening like marbles.
The time we could see from there sparkled, even if nothing big happened.
What we see from the marbles in our hands now is a little different...
Harunobu Madarame: Injury to wrist ligaments; metacarpal fracture;
sprain of proximal interpharyngeal joint; - Full recovery in two months
Hey, Sasahara, is this your first time in Ochanomizu?
Yes, I always go straight to Akihabara and back.
Check out all the college students.
Yeah, Nihon U, Meiji U...
Over there are Tokyo Medical and Dental, and Juntendo.
This sure is a famous place.
Sundai.
What? Sundai.
Athenee Francais.
Yeah, but that's... Athenee Francais.
Bigakko.
Right... Bigakko.
TDG.
Hmm... TDG.
Which one doesn't belong?
Uh...
