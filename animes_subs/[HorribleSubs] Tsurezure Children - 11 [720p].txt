Takase!
I can't help but follow Sugawara-kun with my eyes these days.
What's wrong with me?
Tuning
Chii-chan?
What's wrong? You've been weird lately.
Something on your mind?
Sorry, it's nothing.
Oh.
Are you in love or something?
Huh? Really, Chii-chan?!
Wh-What? No, Yo-chan.
I don't know much about love and stuff.
But don't you want to when you see everyone else?
Especially Goda-kun and Ayaka-chan.
I-I don't really...
Huh?
Hey, we were just talking about you, Ayaka-chan.
Really? About what?
Ayaka-chan, how did you start going out with Goda-kun?
Don't you want to know, too, Chii-chan?
N-Not really.
Did you need something, Ayaka-chan?
O-Oh, yeah, I was just looking for Sensei.
Can't we talk just a little?
No, we shouldn't pry.
Well, if it's just a little...
Come on, aren't you curious, Chii-chan?
I don't care.
Okay, so who confessed first?
This is embarrassing.
Well, I did.
Oh, Chii-chan.
You are interested, aren't you?
N-Not really.
Huh? Is there someone you like, Chii-chan?
She's been sighing nonstop lately.
I have not!
Oh, I was like that, too, though.
That's what happens when you like someone.
I know.
There isn't really anyone I like.
I would follow Goda-kun with my eyes unconsciously,
or think about him without realizing it.
I was pretty out of it during club work, too.
Come on, Chii-chan, is there seriously no one you like?
Sugawara-kun's just a classmate.
He's kind to everyone.
Is it Sugawara-kun?
What? Really?
It's not.
Besides, why would you guess Sugawara-kun?
Oh, no, it's just a rumor that I heard.
That he likes you.
I've heard that rumor, too.
Sugawara-kun likes me?
Sugawara-kun does?
Sugawara-kun does?
Suga
It's just a rumor, though.
But maybe if you confessed to him...
I-I'm not going to, no way.
By the way, how did you confess, Ayaka-chan?
Well...
Come on, let's practice.
My girlfriend dumped me.
I want to die.
Can't we get back together?
Like, what?
Kana, about the other day...
Let's go.
But, Chiaki's...
I don't care.
Let's go.
Water Under the Bridge
I want to die.
What? Why'd you break up?
Because he gave the weirdest first kiss ever.
I do agree he messed up, but are you sure you really want to break up?
Yeah. He's not worth it.
I'm really sorry! Are you still angry? See you at school tomorrow...
Still no answer.
Not even marked as read.
I think I'll stop messaging her.
I've been ignoring him.
Should I forgive him now?
It's not like Chiaki was trying to be awful.
All right.
If she doesn't reply after one more message, I'll give up.
If he apologizes one more time, I'll forgive him.
I'm really sorry about what happened. I won't try to pull weird kisses anymore. Can you forgive me? I miss you...
Maybe a long letter?
Would that be too creepy?
He's been messaging me every day.
Why not today?
Hurry up and apologize, idiot.
Can I call you?
Yeah, this is the best way to do it.
I want to apologize directly if I can.
Come on!
You can't be serious!
What did he want?!
She's not answering.
She doesn't leave her phone even when she takes a bath.
She's totally ignoring me.
I-It's okay.
I'm sure he was apologizing again.
I just need to reply tomorrow.
I guess I'll give up.
But what if Chiaki gives up?
After how long I've ignored him, he might just quit.
He might even hate me now.
I don't want him to hate me.
He pisses me off sometimes, but I love him.
I want to apologize to him.
Please.
Turn on...
Turn on.
Turn on!
Kana, are you ever coming out?
What are you doing undressed?
I dropped my phone in the bath.
It's fine. Just give it a good whack.
Stop, Mom!
What if it gets even worse?
No way!
I'm good with technology.
Thanks, Mom.
I can't give up.
Let me apologize!
He hasn't given up yet!
Answer the phone, Kana!
Chiaki!
Hello?!
She hung up!
What the hell?!
Fine, I'm blocking you, too, idiot!
What? It broke?
That's the problem with technology!
Class 2-1
Huh? Did I forget my pencil leads?
Exam
I thought I brought them.
If...
If I gave her my pencil leads, would she think I had ulterior motives?
If I asked Takase instead of my girl friends,
for a pencil lead, would he think I had ulterior motives?
Well, I mean, I do have an ulterior motive.
All right, take your seats.
Yuki-chan, can I have some pencil leads?
Sorry, my pencil leads are 0.4 millimeter.
Why don't you ask Takase-kun?
You sit next to him.
Um, well...
It's your chance to get close to him.
No, don't bring that up!
Final Exams
Second-year English Exam Answer Sheet
Crap, I'm already out of lead.
I should have asked Takase.
Class 2-1
Time's up.
Pass your answer sheets towards the front.
Thanks for the lead.
Sure. No problem.
I'll give you mine sometime.
It's fine.
Why aren't they going out?
Um...
The solution of ax = b is...
x equals...
Wait, is this wrong?
You want to go to college?
You're already in third year.
Isn't it too late to start studying now?
Th-That's why I'm studying now!
We don't have money, though.
Going to college is one thing, but private?
I-I know!
That's why...
That's what I said to my mom,
but am I really going to make it into public college, studying now?
Shit.
I skipped or slept through all my exams until now.
Now that I'm serious,
everyone else looks better than me.
I think I really did start too late.
Concentrate!
Concentrate, dammit!
Was Kaji always so studious?
I'm surprised, too.
She's awoken to the fact that exams are approaching.
You could learn from her, Kyouko-san
It's her man.
I mean, isn't she dating the student council president?
Didn't you know?
Masafumi, your girl looks tense.
Aren't you going to talk to her?
It's part of her practice.
She'll be alone at the exam.
You say that, but you're the one who's trying not to freak out.
Snap.
I'm handing out exams.
Take your seats.
S-Stay calm.
Remember what you learned with Akagi!
Ryoko-chan, that question there...
Was I wrong?
Can I kiss you when you're done?
Die.
Fundamentals of Exam Problems Mathematics III
No, just forget it.
Finished.
I-Is this right?
I think I answered it, but...
Did I seriously?
No, I've got this.
I reviewed it over and over.
I'm going to get this right and go to college with Akagi.
Uh...
What do you do in these situations again?
Oh yeah, tell the teacher.
Wouldn't people think
I'm weird if I raise my hand?
There's a delinquent taking the exams.
She's trying to go to college.
Of course.
It doesn't matter how hard I try.
Sensei, could you please pick up this eraser?
Oh, sure.
Let's see...
Oh, not mine.
Kaji-san's.
Hey, Kaji.
I see you're working hard this time.
Break a leg.
Th-Thank you.
I'm rooting for you, too.
What's wrong, Kaji?
Are you feeling sick?
No.
It's nothing.
Was it something I said?
N-No!
Want to go to the nurse's office?
I'm fine, dammit!
I want to nap in the nurse's office, Sensei.
Hey, now, Sano.
Get back to the exam.
