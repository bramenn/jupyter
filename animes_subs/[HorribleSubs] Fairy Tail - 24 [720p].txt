Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
The Phantom Lord guild came to attack!
Erza defended against the Magic Focusing Cannon, Jupiter, and she was knocked out of commission.
Now we're infiltrating Phantom's guild in order to destroy the cannon!
That's right, we can do it!
Let's go for even more who-knows-what!!
The door to mystery is right in front of us
The whole world's a wonderland
which we're already wondering!!!
This excitement gets my heart racing
It's wonderful!
Who am I, I wonder?
What is real, I wonder?
Why can't I see tomorrow, I wonder?
The only part leveling up is my curiosity
We can't just throw away our daily life together, right?
Tell me! S. O. W.
Living itself will be our training!
So, we can make it!
Let's search for even more who-knows-what!
We can't be satisfied with just the normal answers
This magical wonder life
Our future is wondering!!!
We'll do our best living our life
the way we want to!
Let's wondering!!!
Natsu!
Jupiter has activated!
I know, geez!
Take this...
Blue Fire!
Ooh, that's cold!
Never eaten fire like that before.
I see... So you're the Dragon Slayer I've heard rumors about.
This means that we're both at a disadvantage.
Oh, yeah?
Fire won't work on either of us.
Don't go decidin' that yourself!
I haven't even hit you yet!
Exactly! I can't be hit by fire!
Then how about this...
Fire Dragon's...
All fire is under my control!
Soaked...
You fell for it!
So No One Sees the Tears
2 minutes until Jupiter fires.
This isn't good!
Jupiter's gonna fire!
Why, you...
You tricked me!
Orange Fire!
Didn't you see? I eat fire!
It stinks!
My nose!
That fire's the smell of a mop drenched with curdled milk!
You dirty little...
Well, you started it!
1 minute until Jupiter fires.
Natsu! Calm down!
Quiet!
Whoa, there... Giving up on magic and using your fists?
In that case I, with my katana, have the advantage!
Too bad.
A scratch like that can't destroy such a large lacrima.
Oh, is that so?
Then how about this?
Honestly, you don't learn a thing, do you?
Why, that... He expanded the fire enough so I'd get hit by it?
Only 30 seconds left.
This isn't looking good.
What's taking Natsu so long?
This isn't good!
This isn't good!
20 second until Jupiter fires.
That won't work a second time.
I told you already... All fire is under my control!
What the...
It won't move!
That fire... It couldn't be...
He's resisting my control?
Did he figure that out during the fight?
Natsu!
How dare you move my fire!
What does it matter as long as you don't hit me?
What?
I wasn't aimin' for you from the start!
Look at that!
The cannon!
They did it!
They managed to destroy Jupiter!
Incredible...
Look here, bud.
Fire ain't gonna listen to people telling it what to do.
It responds to your heart's will.
I see...
Without defeating him and overcoming his control of fire,
it would have been impossible to destroy Jupiter!
I guess I was the one who wasn't thinking calmly.
Not bad there, Natsu!
Without Jupiter, we'll manage things somehow!
Now's our chance to push them back!
Wipe out the enemy!
The bratty children got their spunk back.
Start up the giant.
You can't manipulate my fire any longer!
It's your turn to get blown to smithereens, Phantom!
Stabilizing elements!
Activating lateral balance lacrima.
Wizards in dangerous areas, evacuate immediately.
It awakens!
What the... what?
It's tilting!
They plan to do that?!
This area isn't laterally stabilized!
Laterally?
Now what are they planning?
Hip joints stabilized! Standing up!
The giant has awakened!
It's over for you guys!
Natsu, hang in there!
No way...
What the heck is that?
I mean, seriously...
It's a giant... A magical giant!
You should grovel and beg for forgiveness, you damn kids.
Then you will learn your place!
Feast on despair until the end of your pitiful lives!
What should we do?
The Shades are coming back!
A giant and ghosts? What are they doing?
We'll concentrate on the Shades!
I'm sure that Natsu will find a way to stop the giant!
Sure, but...
Natsu and transportation...
Natsu, sheesh!
You get motion sick?
You can't eat fire as you are now.
I'll burn you to a crisp with my strongest magic!
Natsu!
I'll blow you to bits, Dragon Slayer!
What the...
If you're a man...
What is that supposed to mean?
You guys...
Too cool!
Gray, Elfman!
Mr. Natsu is so pitiful, he is.
If you're a man, then you should make the car sick!
So, are these the remains of Jupiter?
Aye!
Good job there.
It's stopped all of a sudden!
I'll take a look outside!
Letters? No...
That's... No way!
It's a magic circle!
That magic circle is for Abyss Break!
That's one of the forbidden magics!
At that size, we're in big trouble!
Magnolia itself will be destroyed in the wave of darkness!
What the heck?! I don't believe it!
We have no choice but to split up and find the power moving this giant.
Man... Out of the frying pan and into the fire...
Okay then, let's do it!
Yeah!
Mira, how long until that magic spell activates.
About 10 minutes, I think.
We have to destroy its power source somehow.
Our men inside must be thinking the same thing.
There're people other than Natsu in there?
Gray and Elfman.
Elfman?
But, why?
Why? He also wants to...
It's no use! Elfman can't fight.
You know that, Cana!
He can fight.
He helped us when we raided them before, remember?
Fighting with their lackeys is one thing, but if he goes up against their big guns...
As he is now, Elfman can't...
Hey, Mira...
When that happened, you, Elfman, and everyone too...
We all suffered a deep wound.
However, in his own way, he's forced himself to move forward.
I know you realize this.
Elfman... moved forward...
Lisanna...
I also have to move forward!
Hey!
Mira, what are you doing?
Don't! It's dangerous!
Oh, my...
You people are looking for me, right?
Stop your attack on the guild this instant!
This should at least buy everyone some time.
Master!
That's...
Begone...
You damn impostor!
But...
I knew from the start!
I knew that Lucy wasn't there.
Damn it...
How powerless am I... truly...
The Man, Elfman, will protect Fairy Tail with his life!
Oui?
Salut!
An Element 4?
Don't worry. Elfman can fight.
Because he's a Fairy Tail Wizard, too!
Elfman...
Oh, no!
Mira!
I detest girls like this who try to deceive me.
Witness your friend's final moments as I crush her slowly.
Mira!
Damn it, what the hell!
Mira-chan!
They've got to hurry and stop that giant!
Natsu... Gray... Elfman!
My name is Sol! Please call me Monsieur Sol!
Perfect timing. I'll force you to tell me how to stop this giant.
Beast Arm!
Black Bull!
Oh? Just your right arm? Are you sure?
It seems that the rumors are true.
I've had enough of your blabbing!
Didn't you have a little sister?
Sable Dance!
Roche Concerto!
Non, non, non...
Salut!
You really creep me out.
Non, non, non...
Three nons and you're in quite a sad state.
Unhand me, Monster Sol!
Monsieur!
This guy's way stronger than he looks!
Speaking of which...
You failed at a complete body takeover and went out of control...
Enough! Beast Arm Iron Bull!
Lisanna!
I apologize.
But as you were stepping on me previously, I read the gap in your memory.
Why, you...
What a precious little sister of yours.
I wonder where she might be now?
Oh, how rude of me.
She's buried in the cold, dark ground, isn't she?
Oh, how sad...
How could you do such a cruel thing?
Elf-niichan, my brother?
I won't be deceived... I've got to do this!
Non, non, non...
You can't do that.
What would happen if you made a debacle of a full body Take Over, and you lost control?
Did you forget what you did the last time?
Elf-niichan...
How could you forget?
How cruel...
Why?
Don't do it, Elf-niichan...
You shouldn't try to do what you can't handle.
It seems your magical power has weakened considerably.
You coward...
If you're a Man, then fight me fair and square, fist to fist!
If I'm a man, you say?
Non, non, non...
I cannot let that pass.
Not from someone with no right to question the manliness of others.
Trash like you who killed his own little sister!
Platre Sonate!
Elfman!
Elfman!
What?
Why?
Why are you there?
Nee-chan!
Oh? So she is your elder sister?
Which means she was once the feared Devil, Mirajane-sama?
Lost so much of her magical power...
What a pity! And who could be to blame for it?
She is being punished for attempting to deceive us.
It won't be long until she is crushed.
Run...
Run, Elfman!
Let my sister go!
You will lose your elder sister right before your eyes, just like the younger.
And that is because you are an impotent wizard who does nothing but spout bluffs about manliness!
As a gentleman, I cannot forgive you.
I will give you eternal suffering.
Sealing Magic, Merci la Vie!
You will become one with the land,
and continue to wander for eternity inside your own unpleasant memories!
No!
That's...
Me...
Elf-niichan!
Lisanna!
How in the world are you...
Cheer up, Elf-niichan.
It's my fault... It's my fault my parakeet died!
No, it's not!
It's not your fault, Elf-niichan.
Every living thing dies sometime, after all.
All living things... die?
Yes. That's the way it is.
But as long as you remember it, that bird will always live on inside your heart...
Inside my heart...
Don't talk like you understand me!
Elf-niichan!
No more...
Uh, I didn't mean...
Back then, I was...
Sheesh...
Nee-chan...
Fighting again?
Oh, Lisanna... You're back?
Natsu was really mean! He ate all my fish!
Wait...
This time is...
Hey, Lisanna, we got a job to do!
But didn't we just come back?
It's an S-class, too! We'll back Sis up on it.
No fair, man!
What kind of job is it?
Emergency Suppression.
We're heading toward the king of monsters, The Beast.
Natsu, you wanna come with us?
It'll be good experience for you.
Seriously? I'm against that.
A Man should protect his family on his own!
Aw, don't be so stuffy! Take me with you!
Don't! Don't go!
Or at least, take Natsu with you!
Elfman, hang in there! Wake up!
Elfman!
Elfman!
That's... me?
Elfman, get it together!
Mira-nee!
I evacuated all the people in the town... But what happened?
Run, Lisanna!
I was careless.
Elfman attempted to protect me, and he tried a Take Over on The Beast.
Then...
However its magical power was too great.
Elfman's lost his reason!
Oh, no!
What'll happen to Elf-niichan?
If he doesn't come to his senses soon, he'll be taken by The Beast!
Lisanna, what are you...
Elf-niichan, what's the matter?
It's your little sister, Lisanna...
Did you forget Mira-nee, too?
There's no way that you'd forget us, right Elf-niichan?
Because we both love you very much, Elf-niichan!
Lisanna...
It's no use...
Run!
So, let's go home,'kay?
Elf-niichan!
It's my fault...
It's my fault Lisanna...
It's not your fault.
Lisanna told you, remember?
Every living thing dies sometime.
You were listening back then, Nee-chan?
Lisanna will live on forever in our hearts.
Isn't that right?
N-Nee-chan...
So... We're going to keep on living!
For Lisanna's sake, too!
Nee-chan...
Lisanna...
Elfman!
Elfman, hang in there!
I can't... lose you too!
Now, it's about time for the finale!
Why's that?
Oh?
I vowed never to see my sister's tears again!
So what are ya' crying for?!
That light...
Don't do it, Elfman! You can't!
Who was it that made her cry?!
It's impossible! You are not capable of doing a full body Take Over!
Incredible!
O-Oh, my...
That's...
A full body Take Over!
Beast Soul!
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
chasing after your profile left only in my revolving dreams
You said, I never want to see your face again, when you left me
But the tears on your cheek said it all
Every time you felt like you'd be swallowed up in the waves of contradiction
you always held back your tears, you know?
What a strong person, they said, but everyone overestimated you
and before you knew it you lost sight of who you really are
Then the sun I thought would always be near me collapsed
and the light shut off...
Rubbing out the truths and the lies of one day, altogether
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
still, ironically, chasing after your profile in my revolving dreams
Hey, Happy... It seems like it's raining.
Yeah. Our guild's full of holes right now.
With this many holes, there's no lack of leaks in the roof.
Um, it's more like actual rain than leaks...
It's got an air of rickety ancient ruins...
Next time: A Flower Blooms in the Rain
We'd better fix it quick before we catch colds!
It's kind of like a giant shower though... Fun!
You take positive thinking too far...
