Quit screwin' around, Laxus!
Get serious!
What's he doing?
Laxus is getting beaten up?
Something doesn't feel right about this...
I don't sense anything
coming from that Alexei-san, though...
Oh, boy! What a one-sided development!
Is this as far as it goes for Fairy Tail B team and Laxus's tale of triumph?!
It's devastating, really... He's showing such great strength.
And yet I'm not sensing much magic power.
Perhaps it means he's not going all out yet?
Is that really Laxus?
The impression I got of him from you is totally different, Happy.
He does have a connection with that guild's master, so maybe it's making him hesitant.
This isn't like you,
Laxus!
Anti-Fairy Tail guild?
That's right!
Made up of Wizards who are masters at all of the Fairy Tail members' weaknesses.
And the four of us are the guild's elite.
Do you intend to go to war with us?
We know every detail of your weaknesses.
Shall I release the power that my guild has been accumulating these past seven years?
Gramps has already done a thorough investigation of you.
Ivan...
Laxus...
Wendy vs. Cheria!
A thorough investigation, you say?
Do I have to say it again?
The number of members, your guild's location, funding...
We know everything that's been going on these seven years.
What?!
It was Gajeel! He tricked us!
He seemed like a nasty fellow, and I guess that impression was correct.
Then he was a double agent?
He doesn't seem to be one for fine details, but it backfired on us.
What the hell?! Why is he havin' a tough time?!
Stupid Laxus... What, does he have a cold?! Crap.
Are those bastards talkin' trash about me?
An anti-Fairy Tail guild?
I already have info on my foolish son and his wizards,
but I don't have a precise report yet on some of them.
Particularly that Alexei person...
I have no information on his existence, let alone his background.
But isn't that strange?
Considering all of our secrets have been leaked, he hasn't really had any reaction.
Even though Gramps knew all that, he didn't make a move on you.
Hey, Gramps...
Are you sure it's okay to let them be?
You said my old man had information that could be damaging to Fairy Tail.
Seven years have passed since then.
But still...
During those seven years, there's been no sign any of that info has leaked.
You can't be sure of that.
No. I'm certain.
They're well aware of how dangerous that information could be if it gets out.
What is that information, anyway?
You're better off not knowing.
Every guild has their forbidden secrets.
I've heard that in these seven years,
Ivan hasn't been up to any mischief or done anything to harm our members.
As long as he doesn't make a move, I have no intention of stirring anything up either.
Maybe...
Because you're father and son...
Silence!
I've been waiting all this time for this day!
It was all to get Lumen Histoire!
I did your guild no harm for seven years? Of course not!
There's no way the dregs you left behind had any information on that!
Inside your guild, Magnolia, Tenroujima, too!
I searched every place associated with your guild!
But I still didn't find anything!
Where is Lumen Histoire?! Where is it?!
Tell me, Laxus! You're my son, aren't you?!
Even if it's for the sake of family,
the guild can't stand by if the lives of its members are threatened.
That's how the previous master protected this guild, too.
That's Fairy Tail.
The guild is our family!
It's our place to go home to!
I thought you were standing there a little too quietly...
You were taking measure of my magic, were you?
That part of you never changes.
Or is it just that you can't bring yourself to hit your father?
You're such a nice boy, Laxus-chan.
Laxus!
Obra! Do it!
Extinguish his magic!
Now, unleash the power of the anti-Fairy Tail guild!
Is this the guy who attacked Wendy and Carla?!
Scarlet Hair!
Needle Blast!
This is for Gray!
Gotcha!
This is for Lucy!
It can't be...
Sand Fake!
You...
I don't understand.
M-My elite team!
Damn you, old man!
I don't know what it is you're after,
but you're gonna pay for hurting my comrades!
W-Wait! I'm your father!
We're family! You would hit your own father?!
My family is Fairy Tail!
You ungrateful wretch!
Begone!
I crush
my family's enemies!
W-What in the world...?!
Laxus has a twin?!
Wrong, dumbass. Laxus disappeared and another Laxus appeared...
No. This is...
Ivan...
And the others, too...
Don't tell me...
Thoughtforms?
We were duped!
But what happened here?!
That face... The guild master-kabo!
Alexei was really Master Ivan-kabo!
Then the battle we were watching between Laxus and Alexei was just an illusion?!
Laxus is still standing! The match is over!
So we couldn't see it, but he was under attack by five people...
On top of that, the master participated in the tournament...
Any way you look at it, that's a breach of the rules.
That guy wiped out all of the Raven Tail members by himself?!
First, there was Erza, then Cana...
Fairy Tail's full of monsters!
At any rate, the victor...
It's like he got payback for me...
He beat all of'em?! Why does he get to steal all the glory?!
I just hope that Flare girl isn't abused again.
You really are a nice person...
That was playing dirty...
Ivan...
Laxus... I lost this time,
but remember this...
Lumen Histoire is Fairy Tail's darkness.
Eventually, the time will come...
You people are coming with us as well.
Don't touch me!
Enough! Come along quietly!
W-What's with this one?!
Stand up!
After some consultation, it's been decided that Raven Tail is disqualified!
And they're banned from participating in the tournament for three years.
Naturally!
We'll meet again...
Well, that result was an embarrassment,
but let's move on to our fourth match, the last match of the day-kabo!
From Fairy Tail A, Wendy Marvel!
I changed my outfit!
Good luck!
Versus Cheria Blendy of Lamia Scale!
I'll do my best!
Wendy...
It looks like they don't know Cheria's strength yet.
I can just picture the look of surprise on Gray's face.
That's not the face I see...
Laxus got revenge for my sock!
What am I doing?
Give it your all.
Right!
If you lose, you're gonna spin. You know that, right?
Alright, the moment you've been waiting for!
Both contestants are taking the field-kabo!
U-Um, are you okay?!
N-Nice to meet you...
Same here!
Is that girl gonna be okay?
To me, it looks like she's got magic and motivation in spades!
Knowing Wendy, I'm sure she'll be fine!
Wow. I can tell even from here...
She's improved enormously compared to seven years ago.
But still...
That Cheria girl's magic...
This is sure to be an incredibly cute showdown!
I'm rootin' for'em both-pyon!
Pyon?
Your character's changed...
Yeah...
Zeref...?
Jellal! You felt that, didn't you?!
In the arena?
Ultear, Meldy, stand by! Don't move!
Understood!
Be careful!
Alright, the final match of day three!
Begin!
Good luck, Wendy.
See Cheria's ability and be stunned, Gray.
Don't underestimate Wendy, Lyon.
Truly a cute combination! I'm tickled pink!
Was that girl in Fairy Tail?
Yes. I only know a little about her,
but she's a very courageous wizard.
After all my training, I have to do my best here!
Here I go!
Ready!
Arms, Vernier... Enchant!
Wing Slash of the Sky Dragon!
She dodged it?!
North wind, become the breath of the gods and blow on the land!
God of the Sky, Boreas!
Wendy!
Black wind?!
She's...
Wow! You dodged that, huh?
In that case...
Wind! Wind! Bore through the ground and make it dance up to the sky!
Dance of the Sky God!
I'm not done!
Talons of the Sky Dragon!
Roar...
Howl...
I don't believe it! That brat...
Lost Magic!
Sky God Slayer Magic...
Is this for real?!
Awesome!
Hey!
It's ferocious!
Cut it out, Obaba.
That'll be in my dreams!
Who are you?
A Sky God Slayer.
God Slayer?!
God Slaying Magic?!
So that guy wasn't the only one...
You know her?
That one guy from Grimoire, Shinpachiro or something...
Didn't he say it was Zancrow?
He used God Slayer Magic too?
God Slayer?! Nah, it wasn't that big a deal!
No matter who her opponent is, right now, Wendy has to face her on her own.
This is Wendy's moment of truth.
I'm surprised...
I heard about you from Lyon.
He said there was a girl in Fairy Tail who can use the same magic as me.
Maybe I was a little too rough?
Sorry. Did it hurt?
I'm fine. This is a battle.
Since we're here, let's have more fun, okay?
but I'll do my best for the guild!
I think that's fine.
I'll do my best for love and the guild, too!
Gadzooks! To the eye, they're as cute as can be, but both of them are impressive wizards!
Your wig...
Oh, my! Two wizards, both wielding Wind Magic,
but is Cheria-tan one rank higher?!
Cheria...tan?
Strictly speaking, it's Sky Magic.
Everyone...
Everyone has...
Elfman-san said the rest is up to me!
I don't like to fight,
but when I have to fight for the sake of the guild...
So you eat air, huh?
Then I'll do it, too!
Time to eat!
Well, well. Who would've expected Cheria to eat air during a battle?
Does that mean she recognizes her opponent as worthy?
Do it seriously! If you don't, you'll lose a sock!
Cool it. And socks have nothing to do with it.
Cheria is just warming up.
W-What are Wendy-tan and Cheria-tan doing?!
Is it my imagination or has the oxygen thinned out a bit?
Dragon Slayer's Secret Art!
Has she already mastered them both?!
There it is!
Go!
Wendy knows the Secret Art?!
Incredible!
She's as good as won.
What is this?
A magic wind barrier?
You've sealed us inside!
Light Burst: Sky Drill!
Cheria!
Yeah!
She did it!
I haven't mastered Milky Way yet...
I used all my magic...
W-Well, well...
You were wonderful, Wendy.
Maybe I went overboard...
But this way...
Cheria's down!
The winner, from Fairy Tail A...
Sorry! Wait a second!
I'm just getting started!
You're impressive, Wendy.
P-P-Pardon me!
Let the match continue-kabo!
What is she?
Look! Her wounds are gone!
Whereas Wendy can't heal herself, with Sky God Slayer Magic you can.
Sorry, but she has no chance of winning this.
What kind of girl is she?!
Damn you, Lyon... To keep a secret like this...
Even though I told her to give it her all...
Just how strong is she?!
That's my cousin!
She's far stronger than you!
Are you okay? Want to give up?
Wendy...
Excuse me.
No problem.
Mystogan?
Jellal, can you hear me?
Well? Have you found out anything?
No, nothing yet.
Cheria...
Don't tell me that girl is mixed up with Zeref...
Oh, no! At this rate, Wendy will be in grave danger!
I have a feeling Wendy and Cheria's cuteness ranking will go up after this match.
Certainly, people are gettin' pumped up about this in a weird way.
Even though I'm younger, smaller, and most importantly, cuter than them both!
Yeah, well, what difference does it make...?
It makes a difference! There are some fights that I'm not willing to just let go!
Next time: Small Fist!
And exactly what are you fighting against?
This world, where everyone makes a fuss only over people that stand out!
Good luck!
