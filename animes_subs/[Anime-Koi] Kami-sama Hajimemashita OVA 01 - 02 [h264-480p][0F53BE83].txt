The Deity, getting dumped
The Deity, going to hot spring
The Deity, going to hot spring
We'll be back soon!
Momozono Nanami's father ran away from home after losing all of his money on gambling.
She gets evicted, and some weird occurrences later, she becomes a deity.
She then fells in love with her familiar, the demon fox, Tomoe. They even go out on dates.
Though later she got dumped and felt very depressed.
And on a trip to the beach, Tomoe was imprisoned underseas.
She went all the way to the Dragon Palace to rescue him, and started feeling good again.
She even traveled back in time,
but Tomoe was a super scary villain!
Her love for him never changed, however.
Then she defeated the Earth Spider and purified the Mikaga Shrine from the miasma.
Tomoe gaver her a kiss.
Their relationship became more passionate and intense.
Now you must be wondering what happened next, right?
Let's take a look!
I have been kind of restless lately.
This are the real'flying legs'!
Oh, she sank.
Was that...
Can we formalize the familiar contract?
But we already did that.
From the bottom of my heart.
Yes, that was it.
But now I feel like I'm needed.
For now, this is good enough. I'm happy!
Tomoe, do we have something sweet to eat? We have some sweet potato cake, right?
Tomoe and Tanuko-san.
What you wanted is inside this box, Tomoe-sama.
Thank you for your hard work, Tanuko.
It's my pleasure.
I guess I don't need Nanami any more.
What?!
Oh you, Tomoe-sama.
Nothing to do. I just can't stand how selfish and annoying she can get.
I am not needed?
Thank you for all the hard work you did, but I don't need you any longer!
The horror! You just lured, used, and discarded me.
Die!
A lady in this kind of show always gets tricked.
What's wrong, Nanami? You don't like your red bean jelly?
Nanami-chan, I don't think it's poisoned.
Tomoe, do you think you don't need me?
What?
Red bean jelly is tasty all right, but I want to eat something soothing.
Tomoe-kun, what's this box?
It's nothing! Don't touch it!
Why not? So mean!
Oh, that's the box Tanuko-san brought. I wonder what's in it.
Just eat your red bean jelly!
I'm sure there's something in it he doesn't want me to see.
What's in it?
As usual, this shrine sucks.
I, the super star Kurama-sama, got some expensive crabs for you, poor people.
Appreciate it and eat!
How irritating.
I guess you don't have anyone to have a hotpot with. Poor Tengu.
What... What's inside the box?
Um?
What's wrong, Nanami?
You still don't feel like eating? You are always bothering me with talks about eels and crabs.
W-Was I that bothersome?
Kind of.
Mizuki, don't pour her sake.
She's not allowed to drink.
Then it's only for us. You can't drink either, Tengu-kun?
What? Are you kidding? Everyone knows I'm a heavy drinker!
Really?
He is just trying to lie.
What?
So you can't drink. How boring.
Wait a minute there. Don't you want to hear some of my awesome stories?
I want to hear them!
How stupid...
What do you mean'stupid,' you moron!
In that case, why don't you guys see who can drink the most?
We have a lot of sake in Mizuki's brewery.
That's a great idea!
Interesting.
The person who passes out first will be the loser.
Pour, pour, pour, pour, and pour!
Pour, pour, pour, pour, and pour!
Cheers!
Pour!
While they are distracted...
It's not here. Where did he put it?
I didn't know he thinks of me like that.
Useless. Weak. A puny insect.
I kind of knew, but I was still depending on his can-do-anything wizard-like skills.
I won't randomly tell him that I want to eat purple yum and chestnut cake ever again.
I'm so stupid. I didn't notice until it was too late.
In the kitchen?
I found it! In this box...
Inside this box...
Inside this box...
The secret weapon that makes Tomoe think I'm useless.
What?
What's this? A fruit?
You shouldn't eat it!
Tanuko-san!
Wh-What is this?
We heard Tomoe-sama was looking for some pears, so we gave him the best one we could find.
Why pears?
You told him you wanted some pear tart.
Oh no! You can't tell her that, Tanuko! He said to keep it a secret,
because it'd embarrassing if he can't bake it right.
I want something sweet! At a time like this, a pear tart would be nice!
Hey? Tomoe, are you listening?
I just can't stand how selfish and annoying she can get.
TL note: Yonashi it's a play in the words can mean pears and useless at the same time.
She's useless.
I'm jealous.
You're the only person who can speak to him freely.
Even if he acts cold or says mean things, he's always looking out for me, and that makes me happy.
Thank you, Tanuko-san, Tanuo-san.
Don't mention it.
I'll pretend I didn't see inside the box.
She's nothing like that!
Why? What is so different?
I am perfect Nanami!
She doesn't have those watermelon breasts.
You must be drunk, fox. I win.
You're the drunk one!
Yay, it's Nanami-chan!
She may not look like it, but she's pretty chubby.
Girls these days... Padding up their bras so their breasts look big.
That's so stupid. They would look way bigger were she to be doing that!
That's so true!
Even with pads she wouldn't look big.
S-Stop...
There were no pads in there!
I knew that already.
You freaking liar!
Liar!
You drunkards!
Give it to me more, Nanami-chan.
Hey, Tomoe...
What?
There're some holidays coming up.
I guess.
Well, we should go somewhere far and relax.
Mikage shrine doesn't have holidays.
That's true...
Where do you want to go?
Oh?
If Mizuki can watch the shrine, I guess we can take a one-day trip.
Really?
Let's go here!
A hot spring.
What? I wanna go too!
You can't.
Why just you?
Somebody has to be at the shrine, and I have to protect Nanami.
You protect the shrine. That's a familiar's job.
Tomoe-kun,
aren't you spoiling Nanami-chan a little too much lately?
What are you talking about?
Well, you are practically taking her place at school and you got pears to make her a tart.
Maybe's because you are just a good familiar,
but if you keep on doing that, she'll become a Deity that can't do anything on her own.
Nanami-chan was listening.
She is going to become an empty headed who can't do anything?
No way. An empty headed...
Nanami-chan gets shocked every time.
The word'empty headed' hurts.
That will not happen! Not as long as I'm her familiar.
This is bad...
This is bad!
Yay, we're here!
Nanami, this is just a one-day trip, right?
Yes, it is. Why do you ask?
You look like you plan to stay for a few months.
You're just seeing things.
I've brought all of this so he won't have to lift a finger.
I need this! I need this too! I need this just in case! And this, and this!
That's heavy, isn't it? Give it to me.
No, that's fine. It's like a feather.
It's okay... I'm okay.
I have to show him I can carry this by myself.
Or he'll get tired of me.
All right, let's go! The hotel is this way! Tomoe, follow me. This way, this way!
Nanami, isn't that the bus to the hotel?
If you would like to go to the hotel, please ride this bus!
Huh?
I guess this is another way to get there. Let's go, Tomoe. Hurry up!
This way, this way. Hurry!
Do you need a hand?
It's okay. I'm a reliable person.
Arrived to the hotel.
We're finally here! Must be a nice hotel since it choose it!
Nanami? Is that you?
Himemiko! Kotaro-kun too!
What are you doing here?
I came here for hot spring with Kotaro.
H-Hello.
So did you, guys?
Yep! We will stay here tonight! What a happy coincidence!
Really! Then we can enjoy the hot spring together tonight.
That's good, since I can't be in there with Tomoe!
That's good for you too, Tomoe! You will have Kotaro-kun to make you company.
I will go by myself.
Are you guys going to the Koiiwa too?
The Koiiwa?
There is a rock called Koiiwa. If you touch it with your partner, you will be together forever.
Kotaro heard of it from the female customers.
Kotaro is working part-time at the sweets shop.
Koiiwa, Koiiwa, Koiiwa! Blessing, Blessing, Blessing! Forever, forever, forever!
Staying together forever?
We'd planned to come this hot spring anyway, and I heard that kind was the spot for...
That's right. I'll tighten my bonds with him.
We'll go! Right, Tomoe? Tomoe?
Tomoe!
I'm not going to that superstitious place. You guys go on ahead.
While you're wasting time there, I'll be enjoying the hot springs.
It won't work if we don't touch the rock together, so we are going.
We came all the way here, so we are going.
The hot springs will feel better after some exercise, so we are going.
Okay...
Please keep an eye on our baggage!
Have fun!
The Koiiwa is just a little walk away from the hotel.
Oh! I found a sign.
I guess we'll follow it.
The slope isn't that steep, so a mile shouldn't be that much work.
Let's go! Tomoe, Tomoe!
The weather feels great!
Tomoe, I wonder what the Koiiwa looks like!
Enough about that... So you ended up bringing that big bag?
That's right! Look, I brought snacks and stuff just in case.
Let's eat once we get there. And I got caramel too! So if we get tired,
we can have a midway sweet.
I'm well prepared, aren't I? Want some?
No, I'm okay.
Tomoe is clearly impressed. Thank goodness I worked so hard.
This is starting to look like a mountain path...
Are you okay, Himemiko-chan?
I'm okay.
Let's go then.
Yep.
Be careful, Himemiko. There's a root over there.
Okay.
I'm glad those two are doing well.
Nanami, give me your hand.
I'm fine! I'm as good as it gets.
Let's go!
Himemiko-chan, It's steep here.
It's getting enjoyable now.
If you're gonna keep on grabbing my hands like this, then I wanna climb even more.
It's getting steeper, so be careful.
This is getting really hard.
Will you make it there with those shoes?
Yeah, they're perfect for this.
I left the sneakers in my other bag.
Here.
I'm all right, I'm telling you!
If I let him help me now, he'll think I'm useless again.
Nanami!
See? I'm okay.
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard today?
What're you talking about? Not at all!
Let's go quickly and touch the Koiiwa.
The signs says 10 more meters.
Look! It's pretty close now.
Thank goodness. I lasted enough.
What?
There is a very steep cliff in front of them.
Do we have to climb this?
That's enough. Let's go back, Nanami.
You can't do this in that outfit. Let's go back.
It's fine. I can use this and climb up, right?
That's enough! Do you really have to do all that?
We came here for hot spring! There's no need to go to such a remote place.
There is! I want to touch the Koiiwa with you and have an eternal bond!
Fine. Climb up then. I'll help you from down here.
No! Don't help me! I can go by myself!
I can do this...
As long as I am her familiar...
I don't want to disappoint him.
Nanami.
Here, grab my hand,
Nanami.
It's fine.
Here, Nanami.
I want to take his hand, but...
I wanted to walk with Tomoe while holding hands, but...
I'm fine. Where did this go wrong?
Why?
You're finally holding my hand.
Even if we don't touch a stupid rock, I will be next to you forevermore.
If you could do everything by yourself, I wouldn't have a reason to exist.
Nanami, depend on me more.
Okay.
On my own, I'm useless. But when I'm with Tomoe, the world is my oyster.
Nanami!
There are stairs!
What?!
Right here!
There are stairs.
Koiiwa it's written on there.
It looks completely fake.
This feels so good!
I'm happy for you.
Huh?
You were fighting with your familiar earlier, but you made peace, right?
It wasn't that big a deal. I was just being stubborn.
He feels strongly about you, you know.
You guys knocked us out.
We are human and ayakashi,
and we are Deity and familiar.
I hope I can be with Tomoe forever and ever.
No conversation in the men's hot spring.
So good! Local specialty: hot springs and sake!
It's fabulous!
Otohiko, I can't see the moon at all.
Why don't you take your glasses off?
The fox becoming a familiar is funny enough as it is,
but to be working for a human girl?
While I wasn't here, he became a big sissy.
I will make you remember what you used to be.
Tomoe.
