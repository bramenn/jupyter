Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather comes fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
Oh, crap...
What's the matter?
I forgot to bring the materials for my presentation today.
That really blows.
Did you leave them in your room?
Uh-huh, I put it all together in a pile last night and...
I'll go fetch them for you.
Huh?
Hey! Wait a minute!
Belldandy?
What's he up to? Belldandy?
Will she be all right?
Ah! Living Under One Roof Together
Oh, whatever. If she can't find it, she'll just come back, right?
Look at you, Morisato. Did Belldandy dump you or something?
No, she didn't.
Huh? Did you get dumped?
No, for god's sake!
What's up, you had a fight with Bell-chan?
Can I sit by myself for a second?
Why is everybody reacting this way?
Ahem.
What's the problem, Morisato? You look depressed.
Hey, where's Belldandy?
So now you're joining in, too. Belldandy's just...
Lucky you, Morisato. Getting yourself such a good-looking girlfriend!
Lucky you, Morisato. Getting yourself such a sweet girlfriend!
But, uh, Belldandy and I are...
What the...
Is it possible?
You've already gone that far?
Dai-chan!
Den-chan! Dai-chan!
We'll gladly bear the responsibility of finding the right name for your child!
You said it!
Wait a second, will you?
This is not to be taken lightly...
We'll get back to you after giving it some serious thought.
Just leave it to us!
A name... What kind of name...
I don't believe those two!
Hey, that was pretty quick...
Whoops! Miss Mishima?
Good morning, Mr. Morisato.
Good morning.
How unusual for you not to be with Belldandy...
Oh, well, I left something at home, and she went back to get it for me.
At home? You mean, your home?
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
See, I just got kicked out of the dorm.
So you live alone now?
Well, uh, not alone, actually...
Huh?
Don't tell me that...
I didn't tell you?
I had no idea that you and Belldandy were that involved already!
What?
Come on! Keep your voice down, will you?
But, is it true?
Well, I guess you could say it is.
She looks so sweet, but she's as bold as the next person...
But look, we just live together, that's all. There's really nothing going on.
What? Nothing going on? You've got to be kidding me!
There's nothing to kid about, and besides, I think you got the wrong idea.
Belldandy and I are just...
You two are?
Well, see, you know...
How should I put it...
I don't believe you! You're not in grade school anymore!
I just want to take it slow... not jump into things.
With an attitude like that...
Still, considering you once dared to make a bid for me, that girl should be...
You really think so?
The first thing you have to do is tell her how you really feel.
For the rest, you can come up with it on your own, can't you?
True, exactly what kind of relationship are we in right now?
Sorry to keep you waiting!
That was pretty quick of you, huh?
Yes. I wasn't sure which ones you needed, so I brought everything.
Oh, thanks.
They're heavy, so please take care.
Sure, I'll be fine.
Hey, listen...
What is it?
Um, the thing is... you and me...
Oh, never mind, it's nothing.
Keiichi?
The engine evolved as the double-valve system and was gradually improved.
Early engines used direct exhaust valves with camshafts, valves...
She is pretty cute, huh?
She did say she'd stay with me forever, but...
Well, no, not necessarily!
Belldandy hasn't shown any signs that she doesn't want to be with me.
I really wish I could find out for sure.
Keiichi? Keiichi?...tell her how you really feel.
That's it. This is something that I have to take the initiative on, right?
Tell Belldandy that I lo... lo...
You got that, Morisato?
Love her!
Oh, please!
So you love cylinder heads to that extent, do you?
Y-Yes...
Jeez, what's he thinking?
I had to go and do it, didn't I? I made a complete fool of myself!
But the thing is, I really am in love with Belldandy.
If I can just tell her how I feel, and all goes well...
Belldandy...
Keiichi...
No, wait, come on. We are living together, after all...
We can do something more mature.
Keiichi.
Huh?
I've warmed up the bed for you!
Oh, uh, thanks.
No, that's not right! I don't have those depraved thoughts!
All I want...
All I want is for Belldandy to go out with me.
All right, then!
But how do I do this?
What am I supposed to say?
Should I just be straightforward and ask her to go out with me?
But that didn't work with Miss Mishima...
Actually, isn't what I'm doing just another form of'night-creeping'?
Oh, man, what should I do?
If it was going to come to this...
But no...
How could I shackle Belldandy with a wish like that?
No other way but to go tell her myself...
Aww, I can't do it after all.
Ne xt, this just in...
Late last night there was...
Were you working on another report?
Yeah, that's right. I got so much done, see...
Hey, this is really good!
I'm glad to hear that.
But, since you have no classes today...
Yeah.
I guess I can take a nap later on.
Would you like to go on a museum tour with me?
I'm sorry.
That would be a breach of contract.
Keiichi? Keiichi?
You have a call from Mr. Tamiya.
Oh, I must've fallen asleep, huh?
Thank God it was just a dream!
He said he had something important to talk to you about.
Huh?
I can't believe he was really thinking up names for our kid.
Keiichi! Dinner will be ready soon.
So please wait.
Uh, sure.
She's good-looking, she's sweet, and she's a great cook...
What else could a guy ask for?
But if I confess my feelings and it doesn't work out...
Forgive me, Keiichi!
Oh, crap! What should I do?
I'm gonna give it a shot.
Because I never want to lose sight of that smile of hers!
Easier said than done, though... what should I do?
I guess it would be better to take the right steps...
But I got laughed at when I tried to go out with Miss Mishima.
And it's not like I have all these techniques at my disposal...
Techniques?
It's got to be around here somewhere!
Uh... lemme see...
Was it this box?
I could've sworn...
Damn, the seniors just dumped it all in every which way!
Hold it... hold it... found it!
The'Surefire Techniques for Love' how-to book I bought ages ago!
Now I'm all set!
Kiss Belldandy?
Kisu? Would you like kisu fish for your dinner?
Forget it... forget it!
Cleaning up?
Yeah, that's right!
Then I'll help you later on, all right?
Dinner will be ready soon. It won't be much longer!
Man, I knew it...
I'm nowhere near the kissing stage yet.
Confess your feelings at a restaurant that has a beautiful night view...
Sir?
I'm afraid our establishment requires formal wear for all its patrons.
Well, we can just have dinner right here.
So that's a pass.
You should confess in a romantic environment...
Keiichi?
I should've known that was too much to ask of this place!
Not exactly what you'd call romantic, huh? Wait!
That's it!
Found'em!
Candles
Well, better than nothing...
And I need some romantic music.
Heavy metal, Western pop singers, stand-up comedy, rakugo...
Damn, I guess I'm not the romantic type of guy!
Keiichi?
B-Belldandy!
Keiichi, are you not feeling well?
Belldandy, come to think of it, you can read peoples' minds, can't you?
Yes.
Damn! That means my plans to confess were all for nothing!
Although I can only see your emotions as different colors.
And I have to really look for it, too.
Is that right?
Yes.
An angry person appears to be red... blue when he's sad...
I can see it as a vague whirlpool of colors.
Oh, no, Keiichi seems a bit blue.
Now he's back to yellow.
My powers as a goddess have been...
Is that right? That's all I need to know!
Dinner is ready now, so please come to the table!
I'll be right there, so just hold on a second!
Okay... um...
What's this?
I didn't know I had this...
Oh, I know, it must be the seniors'. It got thrown in by mistake.
Great, this is perfect!
I see orange, he's a bit excited...
Um, Keiichi, is something the matter?
Huh? No, nothing's the matter.
What a lovely song.
Yeah.
Keiichi is all yellow with joy now. I'm so glad!
This is no time to be eating!
Belldandy...
Yes?
Uh... could you come with me somewhere?
My, how lovely!
I'm all set to go now!
All I have to do now is tell Belldandy how I feel about her!
What is this? My seniors setting me up again?
What was I thinking, going by that how-to book?
What's wrong with just being myself?
Blue...
Did something happen to make Keiichi sad?
Wait, now he's orange again.
B-Belldandy...
Yes?
Uh, the thing is...
I know it must sound weird to say this when we're living together...
I have something I want to tell you!
Heart rate 150 bpm, blood pressure 170! I have something I want to tell you!
And still on the rise...
His temperature's 101! This is terrible!
Belldandy?
Keiichi, you must rest now!
No, wait, I'm not sick...
Please don't talk now.
Your pulse is racing and you have a fever. Your blood pressure's surging!
Your face is red and you're sweating. This is what they call illness, isn't it?
I told you, I'm not sick!
I'm starting to lose consciousness...
Dammit, I can't let this stop me from...
I've got to...
Belldandy!
Belldandy...
Yes?
This has nothing to do with the contract, okay?
Just like any guy and girl, I want you to go out with me, see...
Keiichi!
So that's why you've been acting so strange since yesterday.
Keiichi...
It's true that I came to you on a mission from...
But there is no more deceit in my feelings than there is in yours.
I want you to be happy, Keiichi!
And that's more than a feeling... it is my own wish for you.
Sure...
I should've seen it from the start.
Whether we go out, or don't go out, or how it looks to other people...
It doesn't really matter, because after all, Belldandy...
Let's go, then, Belldandy!
All right!
One day when I woke up...
A day like any other... another one just beginning.
There you are, yawning... your face is still so sleepy.
Because each peaceful day we share is a miracle to me.
This is where my heart will always return...
Forever...
There's only one thing I wish for.
I chase after the same dream, wherever it may go.
The love I feel for you gives me strength.
May tomorrow be as joyful as today...
That's my wish...
The young girl has left her hometown to make a new start in a new land.
Not knowing that she might shatter the peaceful life of a goddess and a human!
