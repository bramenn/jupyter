Good job the other day. I noticed a lot of typos. And what does the Golubaeser in your blog title mean? Mizutani
All or Nothing
I have to face myself.
If these feelings won't go away, I need to stop running.
Yo.
You're awake, Shizuku?
What are you doing here?
Natsume and Sasayan want to study together,
so I came here to get you.
You need to buy a cell phone.
No, that's not what I meant...
This would be considered breaking and entering.
I tried to enter through the front door,
but your dad was surprised'cause he didn't know school was off today.
Why would Dad still be home?
He told me not to mention that he was home,
before chasing me off.
Dad.
Why are you still here?
I let myself in.
Went under?!
Y-You're saying that the store went under?!
When?!
A-Around two weeks ago...
Why didn't you say something sooner?!
I-I thought it would shock you.
No kidding!
Damn, I was too careless!
I relaxed because everything seemed fine the past few years.
See? I knew this would happen.
I should have just apologized.
We won't get anywhere like this.
I need to call Mom.
What?!
Really?
You're going to tell Yoshino-san?
Of course.
Hello?
Oh, Mom?
Looks like you're in the middle of something, Pops.
Uh-huh, this is Shizuku.
Should I leave?
Uh-huh, Dad's store went...
No, it's okay now.
I would rather have an oblivious kid like you around right now.
Again?
How long does he intend for me to work?
Uh-huh. Sorry, Mom.
Okay, I'll let him know.
Bye.
Die, stubby.
That was her response.
Stop!
Not with the same face, voice, and expression as your mother!
I'll go get changed.
You probably haven't started cleaning up the store.
Haru. Sorry, but can you leave for today?
Shizuku's incredible.
She's completely unflustered.
Well, this is the sixth time...
Sixth time?!
You're hopeless, Pops.
Yeah, I'm a hopeless father...
My wife works, so we manage to get by,
but Shizuku and Takaya must be lonely.
It would be cruelest to keep your hopes up
when I already know the answer.
She grew up to be an emotionless person.
She hasn't made any friends.
Well, she liked math problems more than dolls when she was little.
She has friends now.
Three, if you include me.
What?! Really?
Dad, I'm ready.
Shizuku, a girl your age
is supposed to take longer to get ready.
Whatever. Go put some clothes on.
Yes, ma'am.
What? I have.
I had a girlfriend in middle school.
What?!
Home Run
Is that true, Sasayan-kun?
Yeah, I heard a rumor that she liked me,
so I asked her out.
Yoshida, do you remember Yamase-san?
I think she was in your class our first year.
E-Everybody looked the same to me in middle school...
You went to the same middle school as me?
Wait, you just realized that?
That's cold.
So?
Did you do it?
What are you talking about?!
Just kidding. She dumped me in a heartbeat.
Honestly...
yrotsiH esenapaJ
If you're going to talk about that stuff, I'm leaving.
Oh, sorry.
I was just joking around.
So? What about you, Yoshida?
I'm really leaving!
Anyway, Haru-kun... Did anything happen with Mitty?
yrotsiH esenapaJ
Huh? Nothing happened.
It sounds like she's thinking things through right now.
Huh?
She said that she's going to think about our relationship.
When did she say that?
During the cultural festival.
A month ago?!
Oh, I think I understand...
why they're not making any progress.
Yoshida, how do I do this one?
Because of him.
Huh?
He's satisfied with the way things are,
Like I said, you just do this and this.
so it's all up to Mitty.
Can you explain it in a way I can understand?
If he doesn't do something,
Mitty will move on without him!
Here's the answer.
I wish everything was this easy.
Hmm? What do you mean?
I thought that people in love were supposed to get together,
but I'm not sure if anything's changed.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
What are couples supposed to do?
Well, I can think of one thing to do.
But we're talking about Mizutani-san.
I don't like where this is going...
Huh?
I-I completely forgot.
I told Haru that I was going to think about our relationship.
Oh! Mitty!
You're here!
I just stopped in for a minute.
Dad kept telling me I should come.
This is from him.
Yay! Sweets!
Were they waiting for me?
Haru, do you have a moment?
I brought him outside, but what now?
Was your dad's place okay?
Oh, you mean his store?
My dad called a friend, so it doesn't look like it'll take too long.
Your dad said that
you were lonely because your mom had to work.
Is that true?
Yeah, if that's what he thinks, he should go find a job...
I want to be like Mom.
I want to become a working woman.
But the pot...
Pot?
For holding water.
There was a large one in our yard.
We were going to keep goldfish in it,
but it didn't work out.
I wasn't that interested in the goldfish,
but I read books and bought food
and was all ready to have one, so I was sort of disappointed.
I concluded that I was disappointed because I built up my expectations.
Huh?
Was I lonely then?
Okay, I have something good for you.
Huh?
Come with me.
Stupid.
You can't feel lonely if there's no one else around.
Haru.
Stop! I don't need any crayfish!
What? But there's a huge one around here.
I wasn't saying that I wanted to keep a pet in the pot!
You'll change your mind once you see it.
Public Library
Excuse me.
I'm looking for this book.
It's on the second floor in the E area, towards the back on the right side.
Would you like me to show you the way?
No, that won't be necessary.
Thank you.
Um, the stairs are the other way.
Thanks.
That student's asked the same question five times...
This is a pain.
Why are they assigning reports that
require materials you can't find in a book store?
Oh?
I found it. A miracle.
Huh?
Yamaken-kun.
Are you looking for something?
I need a reference on economic policies.
Modern economics?
Do you have to write a report?
I would recommend this book on economic indicators.
Thanks.
I wanted to see you.
What's wrong with her?
Is she interested in me?
On the last mock exam, you beat me in English,
but I had the highest overall score.
Like I give a damn!
Now look here, Mizutani-san...
No offense, but I'm not trying to compete with you.
Is there any point to studying all the time?
No offense, but I think it's stupid.
Considering how I can fool around and succeed in life.
That's what you call a life that's not boring?
At least in academics, you can control the outcome,
whether it's good or bad.
Hmm? Is that why I like to study?
Haru's not with you today?
Haru?
He's been spending a lot of time by the river.
Huh?
It's November.
He wants to catch a large crayfish and give it to me.
I'm pretty sure there aren't any crayfish in November.
He has the mind of a kid in grade school.
The Japanese Economy and Business Cycles
Damn, why are we talking about him?
Wait, was I the one who brought him up?
But that's the only conversation topic I can think of.
And why do I need to think of a topic of conversation?
After thinking
about what you said to me,
I decided I needed to face everyone.
I don't remember saying anything about that.
Besides, why are you telling me this?
Hmm?
Why?
I was impressed by the advice you gave me during the cultural festival.
Oh, hello?
Yoshida? Where are you?
Is Mizutani-san with you?
Huh? The river?
Well?
Yoshida's playing around by the river by himself.
He said that Mizutani-san probably went to the library.
What?
They're taking it easy, huh?
Geez, Haru-kun is off doing weird stuff again.
That's why Mitty...
I happened to be someone who was easily accessible.
Whatever.
Let's do our best to prepare for finals.
Yep.
I'm telling you, it's true!
No way!
I heard that Kitano from Class 2 asked Natsume out.
What? That's the guy Miki likes.
That's too bad.
This seems to happen a lot.
Natsume might as well only make friends with boys.
Natsume-san?
What are you doing, Natsume-san?
Hey, look.
Yeah, it's her.
Is that her boyfriend then?
Really? Is he helping her study?
What's their problem?
Sa-Sasayan-kun...
S-Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
Natsume-san?
This is all my fault...
Sorry.
So like I said...
She hasn't changed.
Oh, it's Natsume-chan.
Didn't expect to run into you here.
What are you doing?
L-Let's go.
Hmm? What's up?
Aren't you getting on?
No, I'll take a taxi.
Okay, bye.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you realize who she is?
What am I doing?
If you can't give up one, learn to balance both at the same time.
Ah, that makes sense.
Priorities Stupid -> Haru Study (Future) Electronic Organizer Can't break free Family Finances What is love?
Why does it have to be all or nothing?
Are you a robot?
And why do I have to help analyze her state of mind?
You're pretty funny.
J-Just to be clear,
I'm only helping you out of courtesy!
I have no other reason for doing this!
I understand.
Thank you.
Damn it!
Why did it have to be Ha
The girl who's in love with Haru?
Every time I deal with another person,
I'm reminded how little control I have over my life.
I have an announcement.
Starting today, your mother
will start working because your father is a failure.
Have a safe trip.
Oh, hello? Mom?
I got 100 on the last test,
and the test before that.
Why are you a failure?
No mercy, huh?
Oh, Shizuku. Would you like a pet goldfish,
since we didn't get to go to the festival?
No, I don't need one.
I don't need goldfish anymore.
Why does it have to be all or nothing?
Because...
It's a waste of time to bother with anything uncertain.
Oh? You didn't go home yet?
Well, I just got a call.
Yeah, thanks for the heads-up.
Aren't you cold, Haru-kun?
Uh-huh.
Oh, Shizuku!
Haru, you're still here?
Shimoyanagi-kun and his buddies just left.
We were hanging out together.
Shimoyanagi-kun?
He must have been scared.
Man, you look like you're having a lot of fun down there!
Really?
Natsume-san, why are you so hyper?
So did you find any crayfish?
Right, crayfish.
I found one, but it was asleep.
Hiding behind a leaf!
He must have forgotten his original objective.
But I had lots of fun.
That's nice.
I couldn't find any crayfish,
but I'll find something better for you, so don't worry.
Okay... Thanks...
Actually, my brother's using that pot now for storage.
Why does he care so much about the things I find meaningless?
In the end, I'm still letting him build up my expectations.
Oh, excuse me.
Could you pull over?
I'm going to return this.
Then I'll never bother with her again...
Hey!
Are you going home?
Oh. Yes.
Oh, I left my bag down there.
We'll go on ahead then.
Okay.
Yo.
Haru.
Give that back to Mizutani-san.
Why do you have something that belongs to Shizuku?
No reason.
I ran into her at the library today.
Yamaken.
Are you in love with Shizuku?
Is that a problem?
Yep, winter break is coming up.
I can't wait.
You have remedial classes first, right?
Yep.
I've been wondering.
How did you get into this school?
A super parlor trick!
Oh.
Oh, the choose-your-own method of application.
Huh? Where's Yoshida?
Stare...
It's still warm.
Huh? Wait, he left a letter behind?
I went to school. -Yoshida.
