What's that?
Is this like the entrance exam where the lessors already started?
Don't move!
Those are villains.
Thirteen... and Eraser Head, huh?
The teacher's schedule we received the other day...
The trespassing the other day was the work of these scumbags after all, huh?
Where is he?
I went through the trouble of bringing this whole crowd, too...
All Might...
The Symbol of Peace...
And he's not here?
I wonder if he'll come if we kill some kids?
What the pro heroes fight against...
What? Villains?
No way...
There's no way they could get into a hero school!
Teacher, what about the trespasser sensors?
We have them, of course, but...
Did they only appear here, or around the whole school?
Either way, if the sensors are not responding...
An isolated area separated from the main campus
during a time when a class is supposed to be here.
They might be fools, but they're not dumb.
This surprise attack was carefully planned with some sort of goal in mind.
Thirteen, start the evacuation.
Try calling the school.
These villains even had something to counteract the sensors.
It's possible someone with radio-wave-type powers is interfering.
Kaminari.
You try contacting the school with your Quirk, too.
Yessir.
What about you, sir?
Will you fight by yourself?
With that many, even if you can erase their Quirks...
Eraser Head's fighting style is capturing after erasing the enemy's Quirk.
A frontal battle is...
You can't be a hero with just one trick.
I'm leaving it to you, Thirteen.
Shooting squad, let's go.
Didn't our intel say it would just be Thirteen and All Might?
Who's that?!
I don't know!
But if he thinks he can come at us from the front by himself...
Huh?
My Quirk...!
The bullets won't come out?!
Idiots!
He can erase Quirks just by looking at them!
It's a Eraser Head!
Erase?
Are you gonna erase the Quirks of heteromorphic-type villains like us, too?
No, I can't!
But the skills of guys like you...
He's also strong in hand-to-hand combat.
And since he's hiding his eyes with goggles...
When he fights against a group, that makes it harder for them to work together.
I see.
I hate pro heroes.
The masses don't stand a chance against them.
Wow...
Teacher actually good at fighting by himself against a lot of people, huh?
This is no time for analysis!
Hurry up and take shelter!
I won't let you.
Damn!
I just blinked once and the guy who looks like the most trouble got away...
Nice to meet you.
We are the League of Villains.
It may be presumptuous of us...
but we have invited ourselves in to the home of the heroes, U.A. High School...
Huh?
I believe All Might should have been here.
Has there been some kind of change?
Well, that is neither here nor there.
This is the part I am to play.
Did you consider that you'd get beaten by us before you did it?!
Oh dear, that's dangerous.
That's right.
Even if you are students, you are excellent golden eggs.
This is bad!
Move away, you two!
My job is to scatter you all and torture you to death!
What the?!
Ribbit...
Everyone...!
A warp?
Is that his Quirk?
They want to kill All Might?
What in the world is going on?
What the heck?
Here he comes!
I don't have anything against you, but see ya!
Midoriya!
Ribbit!
See ya...
See ya.
For a frog, they are pretty big...
Ribbit.
Thanks, Asui.
Call me Tsu.
Asui Tsuyu!
Quirk: Frog!
T-T-T-T-Tsu, thanks!
She can do pretty much anything a frog can!
As expected!
This has turned into a bad situation, though.
Yeah.
What the villain said earlier...
All Might should have been here.
Has there been some kind of change?
They knew U.A.'s schedule!
Looking at the big picture,
those guys must have set up the media intrusion the other day to get information.
They were waiting to pounce, just as Todoroki said.
But, but!
It's not like they can kill All Might!
Once All Might comes, he'll pound those guys!
Mineta.
Huh?
Don't you think they are trying so hard because they have a way to kill him?
Guys that strong just told us they would torture us to death, you know.
I wonder if we'll be able to hold out until All Might arrives...
Even if All Might comes, I wonder if we will all make it out in one piece...
M-M-Midoriya!
What the heck is that?
Ribbit!
You bastard!
I'll kill you!
There's a ton of them!
Those guys have a way to defeat All Might.
She's probably right about that.
I can't think of any other possibility.
Why do they want to kill him?
Because he's become a person who deters villains and evil?
Because he's the one and only Symbol of Peace?
No.
I mean...
You...
I like that!
Right now... I don't...
Come, young Midoriya.
Congrats on getting accepted.
I don't...
It's fine now.
Why?
Because I am here.
I don't...
If those guys...
Ribbit.
By fighting... and winning!
It's pathetic to lose against a single child
Get a hold of yourself.
You're an adult, aren't you?
The number you have dialed is not in service, or has been temporarily disconnected.
I can't reach Thirteen or Aizawa...
Whatever the reason,
I am neglecting my teaching duties because of what happened outside of work hours.
I did something very foolish.
What if I go say something at the end?
My body will last for another ten minutes or so.
I will g
Hold your horses.
Principal Nezu!
Yes!
Am I a mouse? A dog? A bear?
My real identity is...
Your fur is well-groomed today, as usual.
The secret is keratin.
Humans can't get this kind of color and luster.
But let's talk about that later.
Look at this!
All Might Resolves Three Incidents in Only One Hour!
The fault mainly lies with the ruffians who still cause trouble in this town even with you here...
You really haven't changed at all, have you?
Your hero activities are limited because of your injury and its aftereffects.
Along with that, you need to train your One For All successor.
Since you insist on remaining the Symbol of Peace,
the only way you can keep the world from finding out about both of those
is for you to come here.
That's why I suggested you become a teacher.
I think you can stay here and relax for a little longer.
In actuality, you can only teach this next class for a little bit, right?
I'm the one who suggested it,
but since you have accepted the position, I wish you'd prioritize your teaching duties.
I mean, there are a lot of hero agencies in this town.
It is as you say.
But that is why I was preparing to go to USJ.
Even if you went now, you would be forced to return right away, right?
if that's the case, then you might as well listen to my theories on teaching
and use that to help you in the future.
He's pouring tea...
Have a drink.
He's always been long-winded.
What bothers me most is that I didn't get a voicemail and couldn't connect at all...
First of all, regarding the vulnerability and responsibility of being both hero and teacher...
You haven't changed at all either, sir.
Shouji!
Is everyone here?
Can you check?
Everyone's scattered, but they're all in this building.
Damn it, physical attacks can't hit him, and he can warp things...
His Quirk's the worst!
Class rep!
Yes?
I entrust this duty to you.
Run to the school and tell them about what is happening here.
The alarms are not sounding, and our phones don't have signal.
The alarm system is based on infrared rays.
Even though Eraser Head is erasing people's Quirks left and right,
they are still not working...
It would be faster for you to run than for us to find that person.
But it would be a disgrace as class rep to leave everyone behind
Go, Emergency Exit!
If you can get outside, there are alarms.
That's why these guys are only doing this inside, right?
As long as you go outside, they won't follow you!
Blow away this fog with your legs!
Use your Quirk in order to save others!
I can totally support you like I did in the cafeteria!
I will!
Please, class rep!
Even if you have no other choice,
are there really idiots who talk about their plans in front of the enemy?!
We did it because it doesn't matter if we're found out!
Black Hole!
What do you mean, fight?
Are you stupid?!
These guys might kill All Might, right?
You're contradicting yourself, Midoriya!
The best plan would be to sit tight and wait for the U.A. heroes to come save us, of course!
Mineta...
Are you ignoring me?!
Does that mean they knew what was in these facilities before they gathered people?
Yeah.
For people who gathered that much intel so meticulously,
there's something strange.
They sent you, Asu
Ribbit?
I mean, T-Tsu to the shipwreck zone.
Your own pace is fine.
Oh, is that right?
Well, what about it?!
This means, in other words, the villains probably don't know what our Quirks are.
Ribbit!
That's true...
If they knew that I was a frog...
They probably separated us because they didn't know our Quirks
so they planned to overpower us with numbers.
We have inferior numbers and less experience.
Our only hope...
The enemy isn't trying to climb the boat.
That supports my hypothesis!
But that...
I'll tell you more...
I can jump high...
I can also spit out my stomach and wash it,
and secrete toxic mucus...
Secrete...?!
The last two are practically useless, so you can probably forget about them.
Secrete...
I already kind of knew, but you're really strong.
I have super strength, but...
It's like a double-edged sword.
My Quirk lets these...
Depending on how I'm feeling, they can even stick for a whole day.
They grow back after I pull them off, but...
They don't stick to me.
They just bounce off.
That's why I said we should just wait quietly!
My Quirk is totally unfit for battle!
Th-That's not it!
It's an amazing Quirk, so we should think of a way to use it
I'm getting impatient.
Let's end this quickly!
What power...!
The ship's broken.
You can't give up!
What are you doing?
The enemy will figure out your Quirk
What the heck are these? Gross.
They're being cautious and not touching them?
The boat will sink in less than a minute.
Once they get into the water, we're sure to win.
That's true...
Mineta, did you really enter U.A. to become a hero?
Shut up!
It's weirder to not be scared right now!
We were only in junior high until a little while ago!
Who would have thought that we would be almost killed right after starting school?!
I wish I could have at least touched Yaoyorozu's boobs first!
When the enemy...
When the enemy becomes certain of their victory, that will be our chance.
All Might said so before on TV.
What...?
This is the only way...
You really must be kids, with all the chirping and screaming.
Hey, Shigaraki said just don't let down your guard, remember?
Don't judge them by their ages.
Look at their Quirks.
It's common sense, isn't it?
Because our Quirks will definitely have an advantage in the water.
Act like Kacchan...!
You serious, Midoriya?!
Die...!
He's a kid after all.
Even if it's a smash, I can't get them all at once if they form a circle.
Anyway, even if we get through this shipwreck zone, there are still other enemies.
I can't sacrifice my arm!
After he hits the water...
I know!
Imagine...
Mineta.
Even though he's shaking...
Even though he's the same as me...
Even though he's scared...
Why?!
Why?!
Delaware Smash!
Tsu! Mineta!
Ribbit!
Damn it!
What the heck, Midoriya?!
Why are you acting so cool?
Even I...
Even I can...!
Hey!
I m getting dragged in...
Is this that kid's?
What is it? I can't get it off!
If a strong force is applied to the surface of the water,
it'll spread...
Move!
Get away!
You too!
You're in my way!
Rounded everyone up at once.
I guess...
You're both amazing!
Everyone, do your best until Iida comes back with help!
Next time, Game Over!
There will be a violent explosion in Yaoyorozu's physical development!
Go beyond!
