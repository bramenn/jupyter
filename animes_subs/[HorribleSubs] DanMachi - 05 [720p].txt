Listen, Miach!
Bell-kun... Bell-kun...
Damn it! Who is that girl anyway?
Bell-kun is mine!
Now, now, Hestia.
Bell doesn't belong to anybody.
I know that!
I just said it to say it!
No, I wanted to say it!
Bell-kun...
Please, don't leave me alone!
Now, now, you're being loud.
I love you, Bell-kun!
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Grimoire Magic Book
Are you okay, Goddess?
G-Goddess? Is something wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
What's with you, Bell-kun? You cheater!
Um, Goddess...
This may not be the time,
but when's your next day off work?
Day off?
Why?
I've started to make a lot of money in the dungeon lately,
and I wanted to repay you for everything you've done for me.
So, um...
Would you like to go get a nice dinner or something?
A date?
Let's go today!
Huh?
I want to go today!
But...
We're going today!
But aren't you feeling...
I'm all better!
Sniff, sniff...
Bell-kun, I'll see you at six o' clock this evening on Southwest Main, at Amour Square!
A date with Bell-kun!
A date with Bell-kun!
Oh, Hestia?
Hey, Demeter!
It's been a while!
They're as big as ever, I see.
Yours are pretty big, too, aren't they?
I'm surprised, though.
Isn't this the first time you've visited the Divine Bathhouse?
Actually, I'm meeting someone after this.
I want to go all-out for it.
Could it be...?! Are you meeting a gentleman?
What if I am?
Oh my, oh my!
Hestia, of all people?
Listen, everyone!
Hestia's got a man!
Hestia, who was always so totally hopeless in heaven?
Loli Big-Boobs? That Hestia?
Who is it?
Tell us!
He's a child from my familia.
A human.
Jeez, you guys are annoying!
I have to go.
Hey, Hestia.
What do you like about him?
Everything!
Bell-kun!
I'm sorry, Bell-kun.
Did I keep you waiting?
Not at all!
I just got here!
Oh! Is that Hestia's new man I heard about?
Goddess!
He's so cute!
Gotcha!
Me, too!
Wh-Wh-Wh-What
Sorry, Hestia.
We were curious so we followed along.
Please let me go.
Oh my, so cute!
Bell-kun!
Hestia's running away!
W-We finally escaped, huh, Goddess?
This is the problem with deities!
They're a pack of fun-starved hyenas!
Thanks to them, it's already so late.
And my date with you...
But it was kind of fun.
And there.
Take a look, Goddess.
Aren't they pretty?
Yeah.
Goddess, let's come back here sometime.
Next time, I'll actually buy you dinner.
I'll be looking forward to it, Bell-kun.
There.
Better than usual, huh?
But that's still not nearly enough, is it, Arde?
Who's responsible for the fact that a
useless supporter like you can be part of the Soma Familia with us?
It's thanks to you adventurers.
If you know that, then go work until you drop dead!
Did you see how she fell?
We need you to keep making that money for us.
Thanks to you adventurers? .
Well, it doesn't matter.
I only owe a little more.
I'll get my hands on that knife...
It's all thanks to you, Lili.
Really...
He's weird.
Hey, did you hear, Eina?
Another Soma Familia adventurer got in a fight with the money exchange.
I see.
Why are they always so desperate?
I don't know.
They sell plenty of drinks, so I can't imagine they're hard up for money...
Bell-sama, at your feet!
No!
Oh, no.
I used my magic weapon!
Bell-sama, are you okay?
Lili, thanks.
You saved me.
Hey, Lili, you just used magic, didn't you?
No, that was a magic weapon.
A magic weapon?!
You used something that valuable for my sake?
Thank you!
W-Well... I, uh...
I'm glad to do it for you.
Isn't magic amazing?
Here.
I got this as a present, but...
Thank you.
Um, Bell-sama...
May I have tomorrow off?
Sure, but... do you have plans or something?
My familia is having a meeting, and I have to be there, no matter what.
I know this violates my contract,
and I'll accept the penalty.
Oh, don't worry about that!
Anyway, I'm sorry, Lili...
I didn't think of that.
When you want a day off, just tell me.
Thank you very much.
You aren't going to the dungeon today?
Yeah, I've suddenly got some free time.
What do you do on your days off, Syr-san?
Let me see...
Reading, maybe?
Reading, huh?
But all the books my Goddess has look really hard.
Modern Magic That Even a Goblin Could Understand...
Interested?
One of the customers left it here.
And it doesn't seem like they'll come back for it.
I'll lend it to you, if you want.
Really?
It's not like I'll be missing it.
Just give it back when you're finished reading.
Okay.
Magic, huh?
Okay...
Um...
There are two types of magic. The first is what certain races are born with.
The second, called Farna, is granted by a deity's blessing.
The latter is, in a sense, a form of self-expression.
What are you interested in?
What do you accept? What do you hate?
Desire? Sorrow over?
Worship? Or vow?
What do you truly long for?
The trigger is always within you.
Okay, let's start.
What is magic to me?
A strong power.
A weapon to defeat my inner weakness, and make me stronger.
What sort of thing is magic to me?
A flame.
One that burns strong and hot.
A red flame that doesn't suit a weak person like me at all.
What do I seek from magic?
The woman who's faster than anyone, like a lightning bolt...
I want to catch up to her.
Is that all?
If it were possible...
I'd like to be a hero.
Like in the fairy tales I read when I was a kid.
A hero they'd be satisfied with.
You're such a child.
I'm sorry.
But that's who I am!
That's who I am!
Bell-kun!
Bell-kun!
What are you doing?
G-Goddess?
Huh?
So you actually read a book for once,
and it put you to sleep, huh?
I guess so.
That's cute.
Goddess?
Magic...
You developed magic!
Wha
Goddess?
Firebolt.
I never thought you'd develop magic!
This is because of that skill, too.
G-Goddess?
Magic!
Magic!
I can use magic now!
Bell-kun.
You know you need to chant a spell to use magic, right?
Normally, when you first become able to use magic,
the spell is displayed along with your status.
But in your case,
there's nothing there except the note Swift-Strike Magic.
Yes...
My guess is that maybe your magic doesn't need a chant.
Anyway, when you go to the dungeon tomorrow,
give it a try on something.
Huh? Tomorrow?
Don't worry!
There's no need to rush. Your magic isn't going anywhere!
I'm sorry, Goddess.
I want to use it right now.
Forgive me, fried potatoes!
Hephaestus is freshly-cooked!
Firebolt!
It worked...
All right!
Firebolt!
Firebolt!
Firebolt!
Firebolt! Firebolt!
Firebolt! Firebolt! Firebolt! Firebolt!
Oh, no. I didn't mean to go this far.
I need to get back.
When we get back everybody's going to be
surprised that you defeated a floor boss all by yourself.
Mind down, it looks like.
He used too much magic without thinking about it.
That kid...
What, you know him, Aiz?
I've never spoken to him myself.
Um, but when that thing happened with the minotaur...
I see.
He was the kid who got caught up in our mistake, huh?
Riveria, I want to make it up to him.
Do what I just said.
That's more than enough to atone.
Is that enough?
Yeah.
I'll be going back ahead of you.
Mom...
Sorry.
I'm not your mother.
Am I hallucinating?
You're not.
Why does he always run away?
I-I ran away again...
I'm so dumb!
What's wrong, Bell-kun?
Did you have a bad dream?
Think it's because of this book you read yesterday?
A grimoire?
Yes.
A book that lets you use magic as appropriate
to your latent ability when read.
It's truly a magic book.
Where the heck did you get this?
I borrowed it at the tavern.
They said somebody forgot it, so I could read it.
Somebody forgot it?
Is something wrong, Goddess?
Bell-kun, listen.
A grimoire loses its power once somebody reads it!
Where are you going, Bell-kun?
I need to apologize and pay them back
Impossible.
Do you know how much a grimoire costs?
As much as a top-grade piece of equipment from the Hephaestus Familia!
Or maybe even more!
Listen, Bell-kun.
You haven't read the book.
Just tell everybody that.
I'll take care of the rest.
Leave it to me!
No, Goddess!
Don't stop me, Bell-kun!
Sometimes you have to do these things in the lower world!
The world is more whimsical than a god!
Don't come up with great quotes at a time like this!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
What a big problem you've caused, Bell-san.
Syr-san, why are you acting like you're not involved?
Is it not going to work?
You're very cute, but it's not.
Mia-san?
Forget it.
B-But...
You read it, so there's nothing we can do now.
It's the fault of whoever left it here.
B-But...
I-I'm off to the dungeon!
Um...
Where is it?
Oh, here it is, Riveria!
Soma wine!
Buy it! Buy it!
It's fine, right, Mommy?
Who are you calling Mommy?
I'm here to replenish our item stocks.
I'm not here to buy you drinks.
R-Riveria-sama!
Is that you, Eina?
I'm sorry, Riveria-sama...
Making you buy such an expensive drink for my sake...
I was going to have to buy some anyway.
I'll feel better if it's at least helping you.
You promised.
Answer Eina's questions.
I know.
Um, you were asking about the Soma Familia, right?
Yes, please!
Well, basically, the children there don't worship Soma.
They worship wine.
Is Bell-sama here already?
Is Lili not here yet?
There she is.
Lili!
You're that guy from before...
You're with that kid?
Then you must know something.
About what?
Don't try to fool me.
Help me.
We'll trap her together.
Don't look at me like that.
You're after the money she's saved, too, right?
We're both adventurers.
Let's work together and get some cash from that useless pack mule.
Okay?
No.
Never!
Stupid brat!
Bell-sama...
Lili, when did you get here?
What were you talking with that adventurer about?
No, it was nothing.
Just some small talk...
Anyway, what about you?
It was like a fight almost broke out.
Are you okay?
Yes.
It was nothing.
Let's go.
Maybe it's time to say goodbye...
