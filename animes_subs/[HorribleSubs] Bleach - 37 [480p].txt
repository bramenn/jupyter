Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
It appears he broke through the station gate.
Captain Kyoraku!
Huh?
What, hes here already?
Oh well
I guess Id better head out
Will you really be going?
Its just one Ryoka
and as your lieutenant, I should suffice.
You see, Nanao
Its Old Man Yamas orders, so it cant be helped.
He doesnt want anyone to think
that the Ryokas are giving him any more trouble.
Oh, dont look so worried
Itll be over soon.
Its just a little distraction.
Wait!
Youve come far enough, you foolish Ryoka!
I am the lieutenant and third seat of Squad Eight,
Tatsufusa Enjoji!
You have chosen the wrong path!
From the moment I appeared here, this path came to a dead-end!
Now, now, whats the matter?!
Cant make a move?
Nothing to be ashamed of. That is normal.
After all, this is the technique of the great swordsman, Tatsufusa Enjoji!
So far, not one has defeated-!
In the beginning, two blasts a day was my limit.
Now, I dont tire even after firing more than five blasts
Ill have to thank Yoruichi for training me.
Whew! Good job!
Im Squad Eight Captain, Shunsui Kyoraku.
Pleased to meet you.
Squad Eight Captain
Yup, how do you do?
Hey Nanao!
Thats enough flower petals!
Huh? Maybe she didnt hear me.
Hey, Nanao?
Hey! Enough flower petals! Cute, cute Nanao!
Lovely, lovely Nanao!
Sorry, but
I dont have time for your skit.
Let me pass
What, cant you get in the groove a bit?
Everyones so indifferent.
Im in a hurry, please move aside from there.
You dont seem like a bad guy.
If possible I dont want to fight you.
Hmm Youve got me there.
Neither one of us wants to fight. But I cant let you pass, either.
Isnt there any way you could just withdraw?
I cant do that.
I see. Then you leave me no choice.
Lets have a friendly drink!
Huh?!
Well, if you cant withdraw,
I thought maybe you could stop here for a while at least.
Its just for a little while
I cannot!
Aww, come on
It's the law.
Minors cant drink alcohol.
Oh, yeah. Thats a problem. Thats no good, is it?
Never mind then.
The other captains are on the move too. Soon this battle will be over.
So if you could sit out until
The other captains?!
So, Ichigo and the others are being pursued by the captains as well?
The situations changed.
Kyoraku, please move out of my way now!
And if I say no?
I wont let you!
My, oh my
This sure is becoming cumbersome.
You missed again.
Why How come?
He deflected the first blast with one hand.
And since then, hes dodged every single one.
Why hasnt a single shot landed on target?
He doesnt even have a scratch
The last guy said that he was a lieutenant
That should be only two levels between him and the captain.
Just two levels, and yet so far apart
Is the captain class on such a different level?!
Stop already, Im sure you realize
your skills are certainly great.
Its hard, fast, and for a human, you have an impressive destructive ability.
But, you cant hit me.
Im sure you can see where this is going.
Why dont you give up and go home already?
Thanks for the warning!
But I cannot withdraw!
Stop it, already
Im sure you realize
There are techniques which completely run out at the point of exhaustion,
and those you can push beyond that, at the expense of draining your lifeforce.
Your attacks are obviously of the latter type.
I wont say anything rude, so just go on home!
If you keep going like this, youll really die!
Oh boy, what a problem.
Why do you have to keep fighting so?
Whats your purpose? Why did you come here?
My purpose is to save Rukia Kuchiki!
Rukia?
Wasnt it just this spring that she went missing in the human world?
Thats too short. Its a shallow friendship.
I would hardly think thats worth risking your life for.
Its true I know nothing about her
And that it may fall short of being worthy of risking my life.
However, Ichigo wants to save her!
So thats enough!
I dont need any other reason to risk my life!
Aw geez, what a problem.
Well, if youre that determined,
then it would be insulting to ask you to go away.
I guess it cant be helped.
Then, I guess Ill have to take your life!
Ichigo
I willdefeat him.
I will probably have to risk my life.
Should I survive, this time, I will vow
The same promise as that time, in the same words as that time.
Damn you!
Take that!
How's this?!
Damn!
Youre so stubborn!
Drop dead!
Y-Youre
Oh no, lets get out of here!
Aw damn!
You remember this!
Why were you just standing there, Chad?
Its Sado.
Enough of that already!
This time, you were lucky I happened to be around,
but you could have gotten seriously hurt.
Youre incredibly strong.
Whyd you let those guys beat you up like that?
Why didnt you go at it like the time you saved me?
I made a vow
to never use my fist for myself.
Its a promise I made with Abuelo.
Abu come again?
Abuelo. It means Grandpa.”
His name is Oscar Joaquin de la Rosa.
What ethnicity is that?
Mestizo.
Hes Mexican.
Before I came here, I was in Mexico.
Last month when you introduced yourself,
you said you were from Okinawa!
Did I?
Yeah, you did!
Oh, never mind! Say whatever you want.
Fine, I wont save your hide the next time!
By the way, that thing youve always got around your neck
Is that something precious?
Yeah Sure is.
Its precious
Probably more than my life.
Looks like a foreign coin.
Wheres it from?
Mexico.
Geez! There you go again. Hey?!
Hey?!
Whose is this?
It might belong to one of that earlier bunch.
It's a hassle
but I guess Ill get it back to them.
You should just throw it away!
Neither was a lie.
I was born in Okinawa, and went to Mexico.
Thats all
I lost my parents when I was young.
With no other relatives,
I was taken in by my Abuelo in Mexico.
I was eight years old.
Yasutora!
But I was a rotten kid, hopelessly spoiled.
I relied on my size and if anyone so much as irritated me,
I would punch them out.
And the one who strictly scolded me into shape was Abuelo
Back then, I was truly, hopelessly spoiled.
Andon that fateful day, I was hopelessly careless.
Huh?
These wires are awfully thick. I dont think I can break out of these
This is the end for the Chad of Mashiba Middle School.
So, how does it feel?
Does it hurt enough to make you want to piss? Huh?!
So if it hurts, Im supposed to piss?
Then I guess itll be a while
Sorry.
Oh yeah?
Then, hows about this?
I know! You value this more than your life.
So if you lost this, then youve got to die, right?
So die, you fool!
Wait!
Those big and strong fists of yours
for what purpose were you blessed with them?
Learn about that. This amulet will help you.
Thanks to Abuelo, I grew up to be a decent person.
I could thank him until my voice went hoarse,
and it still wouldnt be enough.
Eh? Wha?!
No way can you break that. Kick him down-
Bastard!
Huh?! What the-?!
Thanks!
Youre
Ichigo Kurosaki of Mashiba Middle School!
Hey, listen up!
Why are you fishing around in Yokochins pocket?
Oh! There it is!
Yokochin, are you all right?
Yokochin!
D-Damn it! I told you guys not to call me that name
How many times do I have to tell you?!
Yokochin!
Ah, excuse me. Id like to call an ambulance.
A-An ambulance?
Damn you!
Are you worried about Sado before you even fight us?
Dont mock us!
The location is on the second block, under the bridge.
Number of ambulances
One, two, three, four, five
Five ambulances.
Damn you! Damn you!
Hey, hows about this, Chad?
You stay the same and not throw any punches for yourself.
Instead, you throw those punches for me.
And Ill throw the punches for you.
If youre going to stake your life to protect it,
then Ill stake my life to protect it, too.
Its a promise.
Yeah
Thats right. Its a promise.
Thats why I cant lose
Those big and strong fists of yours
for what purpose were you blessed with them?
Im sorry
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll always stay close to you
Now and forever
Kenny, one of your bells fell off.
Oh yeah? Wait a sec, I'll fix it right away.
Did you set your hair yourself?
A man's got to look good!
Kenny, you're so talented!
Want me to do your hair, too?
No, no thank you.
Don't be bashful.
Really?
