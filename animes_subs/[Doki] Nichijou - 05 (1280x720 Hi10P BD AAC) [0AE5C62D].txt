H!
O?!
I do fall in love!
I just realised it for the first time
That I had fallen in love
Twenty-four hours a day thinking of you, you and nothing more than you!
It's something I wasn't consciously aware of
Somehow ( somehow) I'm feeling different from the usual
With you ( the two of us) and our dull chatter
Don't tell me ( mutual love?) Nope, it's a one-sided crush
This is bad! Our gazes met!
What, what? Why is my heart pounding like this?
Did a short circuit just make a mess out of my mind?
This is my first time... feeling like this...
I wonder if I have a fever
Suddenly and precipitately, love has arrived.
Instantly igniting my face into a bright red
T-That's stupid?! My hands are shaking
Is this really what they call love?
I-I did it! A conversation filled with stutters
This awkward silence... *mumble mumble*
Your... ( Your...) I want to know your feelings.
O-One-sided love
First love! The usual way to school
The shining light. I do fall in love!
I feel I could fly towards the sky
O-One-sided love
10
H H!
Woke up in the morning, brushed my teeth
In the blink of an eye, it's 10pm
Today, we laughed a whole lot
We had a great time
At times, with my friends, acting like fools, being noisy
Fluttering, our eyes met.
It's a coincidence, right?
I wouldn't call this my first love
It's not my character.
Say, will we be able to meet again tomorrow?
As my eyelids close
I see you sparkling all over the place
Today was fun, too, wasn't it?
I'm in love
So happy, so happy
It is my pleasure to meet you, my new-found love.
Surely, we'll meet again tomorrow
Have a good night
We'll meet immediately in our dreams
So have a good night

Yes, yes.
Nano!
Look, look!
It's Professor, nyan!
Nyan.
You too, Sakamoto... Look, look!
It's Professor, nyan!
It's Professor, nyan!
Professor.
That's probably... moe!

The Shinonome household was at peace again today.
Why is the Earth round?
Why do rockets fly?
Why do magnets pull toward each other?
Everything in this world can be proven by science.
In this world, there are talks about the afterworld,
ghosts, ghost stories and other spiritual phenomena.
There's no way those kinds of sleep-inducing things could be real!
It'd be bad if they were...
In other words...
I don't believe in spiritualists!
Using my day off, I spent 8 hours going one-way to Mt. Osore.
Getting closer to the summit, the beating of my heart increases.
I wonder if a spiritualist really exists here.
If so, where?
I wonder if she would live alone here.
Or...
There she is!
A-All right!
Let's have her summon something already.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Um... Please summon some soap!
Ah, okay.
Bubble, it's Soap!
Mic test... mic test... mic test, test, test.
What's this sensation of helplessness?
Could it be there's someone called Soap...?
I-It's S-Soap.
No, there can't be.
What if I keep asking... Eventually, a contradiction point will appear.
I have a question.
What's the blood type of Soap?
Who knows?
Let's try a simpler person.
Excuse me.
Nobunaga... Please summon Oda Nobunaga!
Please give me a break.
Rejecting me before even trying to summon him?
No, she's old after all.
She has to look after her health.
I shouldn't scold her here.
Excuse me.
Let's go home.
Scolding people is not for me.
Just by knowing that, I should reap what I've sown.
Oh, Onii-san?
That'll be 5000 yen.
No way!
Okay, here goes.
Rock, paper, scissors.
W-Whoa!
You got it wrong, Mai-chan! Didn't I just explain it?
You have to hit me if you win!
It's amazing. You've got incredible concentration.
In a way, it's even crueller than hitting me.
Listen.
As I've just explained,
when you lose, you defend. When you win, you hit. Okay?
Not now! Why did you hit me now?!
Because I won just then.
It wasn't now, was it? It was just then!
It's the moment!
Live for the moment!
We're that kind of living thing, you know!
First comes rock, next comes paper. Rockscispaper doesn't count,
rock, paper, scissors!
It's Nano, nyan
Okay then, let's do it again.
Rock, paper, scissors.
You have zero motivation to play?!
You are a clown!
How much of a clown can you be?!
Something is coming... mentally.
Ah, hold on, Mai-chan.
There it is.
Mai-chan, w-what's with that?
I carved it.
Thank god!
I thought it had been reincarnated!
I will put this here.
Somehow, she looks really happy.
Ah, well, that doesn't matter. Let's start.
Okay. Rock, paper, scissors.
M-Mai-chan.
That's...
No way... such a brutal...
Seriously, Mai-chan, that doesn't count.
Rockscispaper doesn't count.
Also, hitting with the Buddha doesn't count either.
Okay, let's do it again.
First comes rock -
Rock, paper, scissors.
Mai-chan...
That, that!
That's it Mai-chan.
See, you can do it if you try!
Okay, let's do the next one.
First comes rock -
God is dead!
God has died.
Hey, why did you hit me?!
You did it properly just now!
How do I say it... Because I don't want to play.
Can I take a look at your Maitreya?
Sure.
Then, I'll be going to the library to return the books!
Make sure you look after the house, okay?
Yes!
I wonder why Nano's daruma has only one eye...
That's it!
If Professor gave it another eye, Professor might get praised!
Or perhaps...
I might've got it a little bit wrong...
It's Nano's, so what do I do...
Oh!
She might get mad at me!
You won't get any snacks for a long time!
Um... here... and here...
What are you doing?
S-Sakamoto, what should I do? This...
What is this?
What were you doing?!
This is hers, right?
You see, it didn't have an eye...
It can't be helped, try doing what I say.
I'm home!
Stay in good health.
Ah, Sakamoto!
Ah, Sakamoto-san, you're going out?
Professor, I'm home.
I'm late because it took me some time to choose some new books to borrow.
What are you doing?
Eh, what's with that stomach of yours?
It's not Ehehe!
I-It'll be born!
No, no, no, that's not possible.
It'll be born!
It'll be born!
It'll be born!
Um, is this some kind of game?
No, it's not!
Nano's little brother is about to be born!
It's your little brother.
T-This isn't good.
Mio-chan, Mio-chan!
What is it?
Let's play Kokkuri-san!
Hm? What's that?
Oh, you don't know it?
I don't.
Okay, I'll briefly explain it then.
First, you need to prepare a piece of paper by drawing a gate in the middle like this,
then you write yes, no and the 50 characters of the Japanese syllabary on the page.
Mm.
Although in some regions, you're supposed to draw a fried tofu on the paper instead...
For now, let's just keep it simple.
Mm.
Then, for Kokkuri-san to be able to come in,
you open the north-facing window.
Mm.
Then you set this 10-yen coin on the gate.
We put both of our fingers on it and ask a question that you want to know about,
such as a person's secret, or who someone likes, or something that's bothering you.
Mm.
If you do that, the 10-yen coin will move all by itself and Kokkuri-san will answer your question.
Isn't it amazing?
There are some taboos, though.
First, don't do it by yourself.
Second, don't mess around when doing it,
or else you will be haunted by spirits...
Also, if you stop halfway through, you will be haunted, so be wary.
I see.
It's something like that.
It's a pretty dangerous game, don't you think?
Anyway, why don't you give it a try?
It's okay.
What?
Um... well, that's all for today.
Tomorrow we have a mini-test, so everyone please study for it.
Eh? Postpone it, postpone it!
Wouldn't the outcome be exactly the same for you no matter how long it's postponed?
Probably.
Sakurai-sensei.
What is it, Aioi-san?
There's something I want to ask you.
Yes?
Um... about the test we had before.
What is this?
Um... That's a fly.
No, not the answer.
I'm talking about this thing that looks like it'd vanish pretty easily. Did you draw it, Sensei?
Yes. I thought that if I included some pictures, the test might be a little easier...
You draw very interesting pictures, Sensei.
I'm sorry.
I'm bad at drawing, so it was hard to understand wasn't it?
Ah! That's right.
Could you include a picture that I've drawn next time?
I'll draw something really cool!
Okay.
Ah, Mio-chan!
Listen, listen.
My picture's going to be in the test.
Eh? Why?
Sensei said she'll put them in.
If you draw something right now, she'll definitely put yours in, maybe.
It's definitely, but it's still maybe?
Uh... you're not going to draw something?
No, I'm fine.
I'll pass on that.
Besides, I have to return this.
Oh, really?
All right!
One cool guy -
Something like this?
Uwah! He's so cool!
Aioi-san, you're so good at drawing.
You have my respect.
No, I'm not that good... I'm awesome at it!
Just kidding.
Incidentally, his name is Samidare George.
That's even cooler.
Cool?!
Hold on a second you two.
Normally, what you'd call cool is...
Piss off!
Uwah! Amazing!
It's just like a manga.
Naganohara-san, do you draw manga or something?
No - Well, only a little.
Amazing!
Please show me next time.
That is, well...
Eh? You can't?
I want to see it.
Please show it to me.
Eh... Ah... But...
Give that back to me!
Mine are much cooler.
You just ripped off mine!
I didn't rip it off.
Yes, you did.
This kind of rip-off is known as a homage.
You just admitted it!
Uwah! So cool!
Anything works for you?!
Well, how about this?
Glasses!
An intelligent and cool look that appeals to all women of any era!
Glasses, huh?
Is his eyesight bad?
He should just wear contacts.
These two just don't get it!
Then I'll do... this!
They're underneath his ears!
Anyhow, this is a rip-off too!
Tsk, tsk, tsk... they're sunglasses.
Uwah! So cool.
You're okay with it?!
Then... how about this?
A butler!
From picking you up to serving you tea... you'll feel like a real lady.
Feel the magic of Darjeeling!
Glasses again?
I'm sorry, I don't really get it.
She didn't listen to my advice about contacts...
Mio-chan, you don't get it, do you?
You see, what's really cool is...
It's floating!
No, hold on... This... It's running?!
Uwah! It looks so fast and cool!
I can't believe this!
What cool is...
What cool is...
What cool is...
Rationally speaking...
If you think about it rationally...
Cool is...
Oh no...
Just kidding!
I drew this while listening to jazz music.
Morning!
Ah! Sensei, good morning!
Who are you calling sensei?!
Well then, I'll hand out this morning's mini-test,
so please pass them around.
I'm done for...
I wanted to keep secret the fact that I draw.
I can't believe I drew a picture like that...
Anyway, even though I lost control, only going to that level was a blessing amongst all the misfortune.
It was pretty close.
Yukko's going to tease me for two or three days though...
No, no!
I have to keep my chin up and move forward.
Mio-sensei, hurry up.
Um... begin!
Mio-sensei!
Pleased to meet you.
I'm onomatopoeia!
You can't help but say Cock-a-doodle-do in Japanese even though it's not Japanese.
The next Nichijou is the sixth. Look forward to it.
