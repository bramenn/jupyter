Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
Hitchhiking, huh?
Yes!
So where are you headed?
To Nekomi!
So now I'm going to be a college student, too, huh?
There's Honshu...
Kei's there somewhere...
Hey...
We're gonna be docking soon.
Oh, okay!
Ah! A Blessing in Every Bargain?
Three days to go before I get paid, huh?
That's right...
Here it is, my day off... and I'm totally strapped for cash...
But you know how chaotic it's been ever since we met, Keiichi...
I rather like the idea of taking it easy once in a while.
Uh, sure... you're right!
I guess it is kinda nice, sitting here like this.
But there is just one small problem...
Gotcha.
Unless we do something about this, I won't be able to cook for you.
Don't worry about it. I can go without eating for one day.
I'll just get a job that pays by the day tomorrow. We'll make it through this.
All right, then. Why don't you let me take care of this?
What? Take care of... how?
Can you conjure up money, too?
No. But I have a spell that will bring good fortune to you, Keiichi.
Here is a wandering soul.
Provide the soul that resides here with the sustenance...
Apparently, we have a guest.
Yeah.
Hello, anybody home?
Can you tell me if there's a Keiichi Morisato living here?
Coming!
Huh?
Hello!
If you're here to see Keiichi, he's right inside... so please, come in!
Keiichi... you mean, Keiichi Morisato?
Yes.
Belldandy? Who's that at the door?
Oh... Keiichi, we have a guest.
Kei!
M-Megumi?
I'm Kei's kid sister. My name's Megumi Morisato.
Well! To think you've come all this way to pay us a visit...
Thank you so much.
Aren't you supposed to be in school?
Really, now... Aren't you supposed to be in school?
Who would've thought you'd be able to rent a great house like this!
That's a really long story...
Not only that, but you're living with such a gorgeous lady, too.
Man, that's so not you!
Didn't anyone ever teach you to have a shred of respect for your big brother?
Hey, Kei... aren't you going to introduce us?
Forgive me for not introducing myself sooner.
I was sent here from the Goddess Help Line, and my name is Belldandy!
Goddess... Help... Line?
What she means is... she works for a volunteer group.
So her community service includes going out with you?
Oh, shut up! Stop asking those nosy questions!
You see, I have a contract with Mister Keiichi Morisato...
It's a pleasure to meet you!
She's quite a character, isn't she?
I guess so...
Anyway, Megumi... What the heck are you doing here?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I happened to get accepted to a college in the Kanto area!
What the...
My, my... congratulations!
So I decided to pay you a visit while I was here looking for an apartment.
Hold on! What about those two? Weren't they opposed to your applying...
Well, I guess it just goes to show how much they trust me.
But they were so against my applying to college here.
I've got to get back in time for graduation...
But since you've got plenty of room, I guess I can stay for a few days...
In that case, why don't you just settle down here with Keiichi?
Well, if I can't find a place I like, that might be an option.
Just hold up a second!
You seriously think you'd have fun at college living with me?
You'll never be young again!
Don't you want to spend it without anyone breathing down your neck?
Can't you tell I was just kidding?
I mean, if I was around, it would just kinda spoil things, wouldn't it?
Oh, if you're talking about me, I have no problem whatsoever!
Uh-uh!
Megumi made the decision to come over here and be independent.
So let's do everything we can to help her find her own apartment!
All right, I'm behind you.
You're such a caring older brother, aren't you?
Well, no...
We'd better find her a place before she finds out who Belldandy really is.
I can't even get romantic with her when there's no one else around...
Remember, it's only until you find your own place.
Kei, you're the man! Okay...
Then, this is my way of saying thanks!
My, how impressive!
What's all this?
I thought you might be craving some home cooking by now.
I brought all this from Hokkaido!
You did, did you? Man, you really saved the day!
I don't have any money for food right now!
Then maybe I can get you to help me out right away.
I don't know much about this city, so I'm actually at a loss about what to do.
You can just leave that to me!
So what kind of apartment do you have in mind, Megumi?
Oh, something like this, more or less...
2 six-mat rooms at the very least?
Private bathroom... Kitchen... an absolute must!
A southeast-facing room with plenty of sunlight... Non-negotiable!
No more than a 10-minute walk to the nearest train station?
Built within the last 5 years...
For less than 15,000 yen a month? Built within the last 5 years...
For less than 15,000 yen a month?
Well, if worst comes to worst, I'm willing to go up to 20,000.
What's so funny?
Are you out of your mind?
Look, you... you really don't have a clue, do you?
Let's go!
Where?
Let's just say I'm going to give you a dose of reality...
Huh?
Huh?
Listen up, Megumi!
The best you can possibly do with your pitiful budget is a place like this!
I don't think I could stand it.
A room that stinks of testosterone?
It is a very unique room. A room that stinks of testosterone?
I let half of my precious youth go down the drain, jerked around by the seniors.
Do you think you could survive a living hell like this?
A full-on workout, 100 push-ups, 100 squats per leg every morning...
Morisato!
Huh?
What did you say happened to half of your precious youth?
Hey, Belldandy, who are these guys?
These are the members of the NIT Auto Club.
Morisato, you've really got some balls...
Not once, but twice, actually...
You dare to bring women into our male sanctuary, so laden with tradition...
Hey, no, you've got it all wrong...
Not only that, but you've reviled this sacred ground by calling it a living hell.
I hope you're aware of the sheer enormity of such crimes.
Out you go!
Kei, you sure have some colorful seniors running this club of yours.
Never mind that! You see where I'm coming from now, don't you?
It's hard enough in Hokkaido...
But finding a place to live here is a freaking nightmare!
Hey, listen, don't let it get you down, okay?
Gotcha! Of course I checked out the market before coming over!
But you never know where you might find a really great bargain, right?
Yes, if we just look hard enough, I'm sure that we'll find a lovely place for you!
Okay, so maybe I wasn't being realistic, thinking I'd find a place in one day.
But just watch me! Tomorrow I'm really going to pound the pavement!
And we'll do whatever we can to help you.
Won't we, Keiichi?
Do you really think it's going to be that easy?
Oh, boy, it's been ages since I last got to hang out with you like this.
Listen, could you get real for a second?
We've only got today and tomorrow. You need to get a grip on yourself...
I hope I find a nice apartment!
I hope we find someplace that meets all of your requirements!
Yeah, I certainly hope so, too... for god's sake!
Real Estate
Nothing.
Property, Buildings
Unfortunately, we do not have anything available.
Rentals
Nope.
I mean, you really think we'd have one?
Oh, you're absolutely right!
Houmei Realty
Property, Homes, Apartments
No...
About the sunlight... I can live without it...
Keiichi...
Belldandy?
Megumi...
Why don't you have some tea with me?
Uh... Megumi. It's about your apartment...
Huh?
The way things are going, it doesn't look likely that we'll find the kind of place...
Oh, hey, you don't have to worry about that!
If I can't find my ideal apartment, all I have to do is modify my wish list.
I don't want to make poor Kei suffer any more.
I know what you're thinking, you're going to ask him to let me live here, aren't you?
Yes.
I wouldn't do that, it's only going to disappoint Kei.
You mean it would disappoint him to have to live with you?
Don't you get it?
No...
Well, I guess it's because you're so considerate that Kei fell for you...
Doesn't it wear you out to be that way all the time?
No, not at all.
Well, what more could you expect from the Goddess Help Line?
Okay, we've got a long day tomorrow, so I'm going to bed.
All right, good night, then!
Belldandy?
Yes?
Look after Kei for me, will you?
Yes!
O dwelling that I seek, you are at rest somewhere.
Please reveal your resting-place to me.
And I shall release you from your slumber...
Belldandy, huh?
If angels and goddesses really do exist, I wonder if they're just like her...
Real Estate
Oh, we've got one. An apartment that meets all your requirements.
Do you really?
This is wonderful, isn't it, Megumi?
All right! This is amazing!
But I think you should pass on it. All right! This is amazing!
Built 4 years ago. Has its own bathroom, 2 six-mat rooms and...
Has a room facing the southwest. It's on the 1st floor of a 2-story complex.
The rent's 20,000 yen a month! It matches my wish list exactly!
Hey Kei, I want to take a look inside right away!
Good idea.
This room...
Wow!
Kitchen? A+!
Bathroom? A+!
Both rooms? A+!
I'm sold, I'm taking this apartment!
Well, it sure is a steal at 20,000 yen...
Now that it's settled, I better go sign the lease right away.
I'll be right back, guys, okay?
Hey, we'll go with you, then.
Oh, no... you two stay right here!
Don't you guys want to be alone for a change?
Hey!
For god's sake, that Megumi...
Keiichi...
What's the matter, Belldandy?
This room...
Don't you think it's rather chilly for a room facing the southeast?
Well, now that you mention it...
There's something here...
Did you hear that just now?
What was that?
Just as I thought...
I know you're here! Show yourself at once!
Get out!
This place is mine, get out!
Keiichi!
Where are you? Why are you doing such a terrible thing?
Belldandy!
I want you to stay right there... don't move.
Keiichi!
Belldandy!
Keiichi! Keiichi!
Belldandy!
Dammit, why won't the door open?
Damn you fool, for refusing to heed my warning!
Keiichi!
Resign yourself to the judgment of the gods!
Shield!
What the...
You're an Earth Spirit, 3rd Class.
Belldandy!
Why would you do such a thing?
Well, I never thought someone in this dimension would recognize me.
I can see that your powers have weakened considerably.
I don't want to fight you. You must return to the earth at once.
That I cannot do!
Oh, no!
Belldandy!
That body of yours...
I won't let you!
Arrest!
Such power...
You must be... Impossible...
Goddess 1st Class, 2nd Category, Unlimited License...
My name is Belldandy.
If you care to explain, I'm listening.
Please... please forgive me...
Thank goodness!
If he'd possessed you, it would've taken three days to exorcise him!
Belldandy, who is that guy?
He is known as an Earth Spirit, 3rd Class. Normally, one who controls the earth...
But ever since a stake was driven into my Earth Power Line, I lost my abilities.
That's why you've been terrorizing the occupants of this apartment?
To force them to move out...
That's right.
An Earth Power Line?
It's the path traveled by an Earth Spirit, as well as his power source.
If this route is severed, the Earth Spirit weakens...
Really... so that's what happens.
If the Earth Power Line is restored, then will you resume your former duties?
I swear to you on my name.
I'll use some of the energy from the Earth Power Line.
As you wish.
Transform the Earth Power Line into an amplifier... let my powers be multiplied!
Shift the Earth Power Line at once...
I thank you, Lady Belldandy.
If you ever find yourself in trouble, do not hesitate to summon me.
In that case, a friend of mine will be moving in here.
Will you please protect her?
As you wish.
Now then, you may take on your chosen form...
I'm leaving Megumi in your care.
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Did you sign the lease?
I'm all set! See?
Now you can start college without any worries. Right, Megumi?
Right, since this place is close to school...
Jeez, I just can't wait until spring!
You said'close to school'...
Come to think of it, which college are you going to, anyway?
The Nekomi Institute of Technology.
Huh?
Oh, my!
The Nekomi Institute of Technology?
That's right. I'm going to be a freshman at your school this spring.
You gotta be kidding me!
That means we'll all be together at school, doesn't it?
I guess it looks that way. I'm counting on you to look out for me.
You'll be my senior!
Why is this happening to me?
One day when I woke up...
A day like any other... another one just beginning.
There you are, yawning... your face is still so sleepy.
Because each peaceful day we share is a miracle to me.
This is where my heart will always return...
Forever...
There's only one thing I wish for.
I chase after the same dream, wherever it may go.
The love I feel for you gives me strength.
May tomorrow be as joyful as today...
That's my wish...
The human struggles, not knowing what's in the heart of a goddess.
The goddess ponders...

I know I love motorcycles, but this is too much...
