Vajarois wakes with the midnight toll at the close of the Festival.
Unable to forget the agony of losing her friends, she demands sacrifices to...
Chomp.
Chariot was chosen as the Moonlit Witch of the Samhain Festival because of her transformation magic,
but that wasn't actually her intention.
That's why I want us to put on a fun metamorphosis magic show and make that Vajarois the Wailing
Huh? Well, isn't it awful to have this whole ritual about people staring at Vajarois crying as she's eating sacrifices?
Huh? Don't you think it's awful to have this whole ritual where everyone just stares at Vajarois cry and eat sacrifices?
Magic is meant to make everyone happy.
Let's use metamorphosis magic to blow her tears...
But that'sTrue, I guess...
But that'sI mean, true...
Lotte and Sucy keep telling me we shouldn't change anything.
But I think that if we use the metamorphosis magic Chariot did at her Samhain Festival,
we could make everyone feel excited too.
Sure, I will always make time for you.
Sure, I'll always lend an ear.
You think that's enough to get our forgivenes?
It is not! How much humiliation do you think we faced?
Since you unfortunately ended up becoming the sacrifices, we'll let it slide.
Considering that you have to be the pifitufl sacrifieces, we'll let it slide.
Oh, I can hardly wait to see you mocked and ridiculed by everyone!
Yes, I can hardly wait to see you become laughingstocks.
There could hardly be better sacrifices.
Akko the buffoon and creepy Sucy.
Plus the one who may as well just not be there, Invisible Lotte!
Plus Invisible Lotte, whom nobody would even notice is missing!
Wallflower Lotte who nobody would notice is missing.
The group of leftover losers.
Metamorphie Faciesse!
The first successful greenhouse horticulture of purple mandrake was by Doctor Weather, thirty years ago...
Invisible Lotte who may as well just not be there, huh...
Wallflower Lotte who nobody would notice is missing, huh...
Let's see... found it!
Records state that a certain curse caused her to remain as a ghost after her death.
I guess I really will need to search older documents.
She flounders and suffers, and yet she keeps reaching for what she can't possibly reach.
She keeps reaching out to things beyond her reach despite failure and pain.
Isn't she just an idiot? And a stubborn one at that.
What's this...?
But together, we might just be able to make something happen.
We did some thinking, and it would be best if you used metamorphosis magic by yourself.
It'll be much more interesting with us in assisting roles.
If we just assisted you, that would make it much more interesting.
Back when I felt like magic was fun.
The lights have been lit above the stage on Luna Nova's field.
As our guests of honor, Miss Marjolaine, Minister Dorlin, and Madame Ural look on,
At the completion of the Festival, the most exceptional witch out of all the students will be chosen
The Samhain Festival is underway!
Quite the performance.
This is what you get when you let Holbrook head the school.
This is what happens when you let Holbrooke be headmistress.
She's probably just practicing until the last minute.
She's training as much as she can to see what she believes through to the end!
We're about to see committee chair Diana with her summoning magic!
It's committee chair Diana with her summoning magic!
Behold this water summoning magic, passed down from the ancient times.
Behold this water summoning magic, passed down through antiquity.
Shriare Muruere.
Tiefille Lillianna!
Sorry, my bad. I lost track of time practicing.
As soon as the midnight toll rings, the ritual sacrifice will begin!
Ready, folks?
Fun?
Sacrifice show?
Look over here, Vajarois!
This is unprecenented! The sacrifice is escaping!
The stage is destroyed, but what about Akko?!
Thanks guys!
It's actually intriguing.
Troute Estaeda!
Vajarois has sneezed them far into the sky!
Professor Urusla's familiar!
She has cast a curse of eternal sorrow on herself so she'd always remember her friends.
That's Vajarois'... original form?
Pretty damn good!
That was well worth seeing.
They haven't finished counting, but you're on track to be the Moonlit Witch.
Vajarois wakes at the close of the Festival, when the midnight bell tolls.
Unable to forget the agony of losing her friends, she demands sacrifices to...
Chomp.
Will that happen to us too? Just the thought...
Sends a shiver down my spine!
All right!
Let's make Vajarois burst into laughter during the ritual sacrifice!
Huh?
Chariot was chosen as the Moonlit Witch of the Samhain Festival because of her metamorphosis magic,
but that wasn't why she performed it.
As far as I could tell, she just wanted to give everyone a thrilling time!
That's why I want us to put on a fun metamorphosis magic show and make Vajarois the Wailing
double over with laughter!
For what reason?
Huh? Well, don't you think it's awful to have this whole ritual where people stare at Vajarois cry and eat sacrifices?
Magic should be more exciting and thrilling!
It's supposed to make everyone happy!
Like Chariot did...
Listen, what's the point in going that far?
It's not like anyone asked us to.
I think following tradition is good enough.
But then Vajarois will keep crying forever!
Let's blow away her tears with metamorphosis magic, and...
The ritual's always been done the same way.
Besides, you can't even do regular metamorphosis magic right yet.
But that'strue, I guess...
Akko...
I understand your feelings...
But we can't always keep up with you.
But I want everyone to see how fun magic is!
I'll work as hard as I can so you two can understand too.
Just watch me!

I see.
I don't want to give up.
Lotte and Sucy keep telling me we should stick to how it's always been done.
I just think that if we use the metamorphosis magic Chariot did at her Samhain Festival,
we could make this really exciting for everyone...
The magic Chariot used at the Festival...
Arae Aryrha. The third Word.
Do your best, Akko.
I'll do some research on Vajarois the Wailing.
You keep practicing on your own.
Okay.
Thank you very much. I'll come back if I need your help again.
Sure, I'll always make time for you.
The reason Vajarois is drowning in sorrow...
If I prove to Lotte and Sucy that I can do it, they'll definitely be on my side.
A word, Akko.
You certainly pulled a fast one on us the other day.
I-I apologize for that.
You think that's enough to earn our forgiveness?
It is not! Just how much humiliation do you think we've had to face?
Still...
You know...
Considering that you have to be the pitiful sacrifices, we'll let it slide.
Oh, I can hardly wait to see you become laughingstocks!
I can't imagine better sacrifices!
Akko the Buffoon and Creepy Sucy.
Plus the girl with a presence as thin as air, Invisible Lotte!
A real merry band of leftover losers!
What's with that face? Got something to say?
Would you please not get mad when all we've done is said the truth?
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Metamorphie Facie
The first successful greenhouse cultivation of purple mandrake was conducted by Doctor Weather thirty years ago...
Metamorphie Facie...
Invisible Lotte with a presence as thin as air, huh...
Look sharp! The Samhain Festival is almost upon us!
Yes!
Let's see... there it is!
Princess Vajarois of the Book Kingdom.
Records state that a certain curse caused her to remain in existence as a ghost after her passing.
That's it?!
I guess I really will need to dig into older materials...
Vajarois's Vestige?
Can be found in Luna Nova's reference archives.
It's been three weeks... Akko's working hard.
Three weeks and three days. Though she hasn't improved a bit.
Hey, Sucy... why do you think Akko can keep it up?
She flounders and suffers, and yet she keeps reaching out for things beyond her grasp.
Isn't that just because she's an idiot? And a stubborn one at that.
But that part of her is amazing.
What's this?

Lotte? Sucy?
You really are someone who can't do anything by herself, Akko.
But the three of us just might be able to make something happen.
We did some thinking, and it would be best if you handled the metamorphosis magic by yourself.
It'd be much more interesting with us as your assistants.
Even if you mess up, we can cover for your mistakes.
Then...
Watching you brought back memories.
I remembered the excitement I felt talking to faeries for the first time as a child.
Back when magic meant nothing but fun to me.
Maybe having fun with you isn't such a bad option.
Thanks, you two!
Too tight!
It's the long-awaited Samhain Festival!
Alumna have gathered from around the world via the leylines.
Vajarois's Vestige should be in here...
The lights have been lit above the stage on Luna Nova's sports ground.
With our guests of honorMiss Marjolaine, Minister Dorlin, and Madame Uralin attendance,
the Samhain Festival committee chair, Diana Cavendish, will deliver the opening statement.
I hereby declare the start of the Luna Nova Samhain Festival.
Also, at the close of the Samhain Festival, the most exceptional witch out of all the students will be chosen
and earn the title of Moonlit Witch!
Now, who will claim the crown?!
Not this one, or this one either!
Little Witch Academia

Nothing to write home about, just like every year.
It's no wonder magic is dying out.
This is what you get when you let Holbrooke head the school.
Hang in there! Don't give up!
You'll be fine! Just fine!
Akko sure is late.
She's probably practicing until the very last minute.
Has Akko arrived yet? There's precious little time left.
Maybe she's finally realized how worthless she is...
She ran away from her responsibilities, leaving all the burden on your shoulders.
Diana, you're up next.
How pathetic.
You have my condolences, being forced into a group with her.
Akko wouldn't run away!
She's pouring everything she has into making what she believes in happen!
She may be stubborn, but that's what makes her Akko!
Metamorphie Faciesse!
It's time for the headliner!
Stepping forward is committee chair Diana with her summoning magic!
It's the Cavendish's girl, Diana.
I'll see if she's worthy of carrying on her prestigious family's name.
It's finally time.
Luna Nova's star!
Indeed.
Behold this water summoning magic, passed down from ancient times.
Shurial Muryuelle.
Creature of the holy mane...
Absorb the light of the stars and rise from this gushing spring!
Tiphillie Lirullianae!
Magnificent!
As expected of Luna Nova's star!
Sounds like Diana did great.
Yeah, well it is Diana.
Sorry I'm late!
Akko!
Geez, you took your time!
Sorry, my bad! I lost track of the time practicing.
All right. Lotte, Sucy.
Let's do everything we can!
Yeah.
We've reached the last act of the Samhain Festival!
As soon as the midnight bell tolls, the ritual sacrifice will begin!
This year's sacrifices are Lotte Jansson, Sucy Manbavaran, and Atsuko Kagari!
Akko...
Watch me.
Are you ready, folks?
It's time for the super fun sacrifice show!
Fun?
Sacrifice show?
Headmistress!
Vajarois the Wailing makes her grand entrance!
Akko!
Over here!
What's this? Have they left Akko to be the sole sacrifice?
Look at me, Vajarois!
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Metamorphie Fac
The poor girl has fallen prey to Vajarois...
W-Wait?!
What a surprise! She transformed into a mouse to avoid the danger!
This is unprecedented! The sacrifice is escaping!
Wh-What has she done?!
Let it be.
Come on, Vajarois! Catch me if you can!
The stage is getting destroyed, but what about Akko?!
They've changed things up this year.
I must admit it's rather interesting.
And now Akko has turned into a flying elephant!
How adorable!
Headmistress!
I can't keep afloat!
Nice support. Guess I should help out too.
What's happening now?
Mushrooms! Mushrooms have begun to sprout!
Thanks, guys!
Akko, look out behind you!
Now! Lotte, Sucy!
We're on it!
Yahoo, Vajarois!
Don't be so sad! Let's turn that frown upside down!
This is so vulgar.
Hea
What are they doing?
Look at her head!
Vajarois! Are you having fun?
Blow away your sadness with a smile!
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Show me that smile of yours, Vajarois!
Akko just never gets it right.
But she's getting laughs, and that's what counts.
What's with that crappy magic!
This is actually rather intriguing.
Nice one, Akko!
How's that, Vajarois?
Having fun y
Lotte! Sucy!
Doesn't seem like Vajarois herself is having much fun.
Huh?
Vajarois...
I've finally found it!
I was worried it was gone forever.
Triutoi Estida!
O ancient faerie, heed my call.
What is the truth of Vajarois's curse?
This is... the seed of sorrow?
Having lost many a friend, Princess Vajarois swallowed the seed of sorrow so as not to forget them.
The seed spreads its roots within whoever swallows it, making their sorrow eternal...
So, what now?
Vajarois... why are you so sad?
The rod!
Vajarois has sneezed them high up into the sky!
Akko! Akko!
Professor Ursula's familiar!
And the Shiny Rod too!
Listen carefully, Akko.
A seed of sorrow has spread its roots inside Vajarois.
A seed of sorrow?
She cast a curse of eternal sorrow on herself so she'd always remember her friends.
You have to pull the seed of sorrow out!
Use Chariot's magic! You three can surely succeed!
Okay!
Where's the source of her sorrow?!
Hey, isn't that it?
It can't be anything else.
Okay! Let's do this, Lotte, Sucy!
Vajarois, think back! Remember all the smiles and laughter you shared with your friends!
Arae Aryrha!
And pull!
What's this! Something's happening to Vajarois!
Akko...
What could possibly be happening inside Vajarois?!
Vajarois...
Your friends wouldn't want you to live in sorrow!
They surely want to see you smile, Vajarois.
Open your heart!
Let's laugh together!
Arae Aryrha!
That's Vajarois's... original form?
Th-This is incredible! The three sacrifices have done the unimaginable!
That wasn't half shabby!
It was well worth seeing.
With this, Luna Nova should have no more reason to conduct the ritual sacrifice.
Yes.
You did it, Akko.
Lotte! Sucy!
I couldn't have done it without you!
Wasn't that fun, Akko?
I give it a passing grade.
Diana!
They haven't finished counting yet, but you're on track to be the Moonlit Witch.
What about Akko's group?
They broke the rules, so they're out of consideration.
But they sure did do a nice thing.
There's the award ceremony coming up, so get ready.
Back to Akko! She's so moved by breaking Vajarois' curse that she can hardly speak through the tears!
What is it...
That has filled me with this emotion?
