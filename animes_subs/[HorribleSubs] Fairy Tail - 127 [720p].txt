Never before in all the world had such a mysterious phantom manifested...
And whenever that strange figure appeared before people,
they all felt a chill run down their spines...
You're out of places to run, serial jewelry thief!
Villain! Surrender!
Fools! You really believe you can capture me?!
Monster!
An invisible person!
Yes, be shocked! And cringe in fear!
This is my true form!
Was there ever anything more fearsome in this world
than this absolute hollowness, this infinite nothingness?
To the people involved, it was like glimpsing a rip in the fabric of the world.
They shivered in terror, shaken to their very souls...
Huh... So this is the kind of story Lucy writes...
Hey, hey!
I never said you could read it!
Yo, Lucy.
So this time it's a story about an invisible person, huh?
W-Well, I thought I'd try tackling sort of a different genre, so...
Everybody's thought at least once about what would happen
if they became invisible, right?
And I had a feeling I could write an interesting story about it...
Fools! You really believe you can capture me?!
Yes, be shocked! And cringe in fear!
This is my true form!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
What did you two come here for?!
If you've got no reason, then get out!
We're here to invite you out on a job!
If you don't work, you're gonna be flat broke.
I'm busy right now!
I'm sure you two can handle whatever the job is.
That's not the way it works. We're a team, remember?
Aye!
And when we work together as a team, it's gotta include you.
Natsu...
Plus, I'm starving!
Do you have anything to eat around here?
You know...
This isn't a restaurant!
The Terror of Invisible Lucy!
I lost all my concentration!
Think I'll clear my head with a bath...
Magic ointment...?
Oh, that's right. I prepared it myself, didn't I?
Using this will make my skin so beautiful, it'll almost be translucent.
It's been a long time, maybe I'll put some on...
An invisible person...
I wonder what I could do if that really happened to me.
Surprise everyone...
And maybe it would be useful for work...
What a dreamer!
Feel a little dizzy...
Huh?
What? What's this?!
I've really become invisible!
I see... I made this ointment seven years ago.
Maybe is got so old that the effect has changed!
I can't just stay like this!
I need Natsu and the rest to help me!
This is bad... If I go outside like this, it'll cause a panic!
Huh?
That's strange. No one's there, but...
No one can see me, so I'd better be careful or they'll bump into me...
Oh, I know. I'll stay off to the side.
I came out in a hurry, but now that I think of it, I'm naked.
If the ointment wears off...
Although come to think of it, now that nobody can see me,
even if I do this weird pose...
Or this pose... or this pose...
Nobody can see it!
It's embarrassing, but fun!
Though I feel like an idiot getting excited all by myself...
Hey... Cut it out! Shoo!
What's wrong? There's nothing there.
Whose voice is that?
That was close.
I'd better get to Fairy Tail and fast...
What is that? Something's here!
Weird!
You're right! I feel something!
It's soft and warm!
It feels like a person!
Oh, no...
Th-That tickles! Knock it off!
Don't touch me!
It ran away!
Come back here!
It's an invisible ghost!
Let's catch it!
Gimme a break! What a revolting development!
I know! I'll hide in here!
Come back!
Safe...
F-Finally made it...
What a mooch, Natsu!
Huh, so Lucy-nee literally booted you out?
Yeah, even though I was there to invite her out on a job!
It's only natural she'd be angry.
I hear you two sometimes even use her bath without asking.
That's a flagrant breach of manners.
I agree.
Even though you're on the same team, a line needs to be drawn.
Whenever you're out of money, come over here and I'll feed you.
Although for inconsiderate jerks like you two,
I'm sure this goes right over your heads.
But I think she could've been a little nicer to us!
That kind of behavior is the reason she'll never be able to snag a boyfriend!
He's got her number!
Or even if she got a boyfriend, I bet he'd run away first chance he had.
She was born a lady outside, but she's a barbarian on the inside.
Mm. Only a Man who was truly wild could be a match for her.
Lucy should learn a little from Team Shadow Gear's Levy!
She should act more like a lady!
I'm not all that ladylike myself, but still...
So I'm the butt of their jokes when they think I'm not here...
Bastard! What the hell'd you do that for?!
Don't play dumb! You just doused me with a mug of booze!
Don't go making weird accusations!
If it wasn't you, then who did it?!
How do I know?!
Ow!
What was that for?!
You're the one that started it!
What have we here?! A fight?!
What's going on all of a sudden?
Something about getting splashed with booze...
Hey! If you're gonna fight, take it elsewhere!
Just when I was getting into it...
What the hell are you doin'?!
Asshole! You lookin' for a fight?!
Don't bug me when I'm eatin'!
What the hell?!
Move it! We're tryin' to have a fight here!
Seven years have passed and you still haven't picked a job?!
I'm looking for the job that only I can do!
What's going on?!
Everyone, calm down! What started this?!
Leave them be. This is no different than usual.
But at this rate, they'll destroy the guild hall!
We can always fix it later.
Not getting upset by every little thing is the mark of an adult.
Honestly, this bunch hasn't matured at all.
If anything, they've become even more boisterous these past seven years...
Morons... You've taken it too far!
Even Erza-san joined in!
I figured she would...
It looks like Erza hasn't matured any either.
It's become a regular riot!
Ouch!
Lucy's... voice? And her scent, too...
Lucy, is that you?!
Don't touch me there!
Lucy, he says?
Lucy's here?
I could hear her voice...
But I can't see her!
Lucy, where are you?
The cat's out of the bag!
I see. So that's what happened...
What a weird sight...
S-Stop staring at me like that. I'm getting embarrassed.
Creepy!
Who's creepy?!
This is a real pickle...
For now, we rounded up some clothes for you, but...
You can't change back to normal?
No... I came here because I thought you guys could do something...
I don't see what the problem is.
It could be a lot of fun, so let's go out on a job with you like that!
I can't go like this!
Doesn't anyone know of a way to cancel out invisibility magic?!
Easier said than done...
Hmmm...
Okay! I have a good idea!
What?!
Toasting you with flames will probably fix it!
Y-You have grounds to believe that?
True, when I turned to stone that one time, he did the same thing to me.
But if we can't think of anything else, I guess that's the only way to go.
Mm. If you're a Man, you'll do it without hesitation.
I'm a girl!
Alright, here I go, Lucy!
I'll help you, Natsu-nii!
Wait! I'm not mentally prepared yet!
Ready... go!
Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot!
Hmm, looks like it didn't work...
Of course it didn't!
Keep your chin up, Lu-chan.
I'm sure we'll find a way...
Oui. I believe a time like this is made for me to step up.
Reedus!
Do you have some kind of plan?
Leave it to me...
All I have to do is paint Lucy's face!
Th-That looks like her and doesn't look like her at the same time...
Unlike the real Lucy, she's beautiful!
I kind of have mixed feelings...
Hmm... Then what if I add this?!
Now this, I hate!
I can paint better than that!
Don't!
Finished! Looks just like you!
I'm not a cat!
That's right! Lucy's face is more like this, this, and like this!
No, her eyes are more like this!
H-Hey...
Mmm...
What do you mean, mmm?!
Aren't her nose and mouth like this?
In that case, there's more of an impact if we go like this.
You guys suck. Let me give it a whack!
Nah, leave it to me.
I used to take drawing class when I was a kid.
I would go bolder, like so!
It's important to have distinct characteristics.
She's a girl, so we should make her cuter!
She needs sparkling eyes!
Or better yet, how about black hair?
It may look good on her!
I'd rather try out a different hairstyle.
Like very short or with dreads...
She'd look good with an afro, too, don't you think?
Then we have to paint her face, too!
My face isn't a toy!
Oh, she's a Man!
Why'd you make me like this?!
This is a pain! Leave everything to me!
Wow, that looks just like her!
I'm sure you have no complaints about this, right?!
Creepy!
Don't be rude!
Hey... What's this?
A photo from when they did an article on us that time...
For now, make do with that, okay?
Well, this is better than before, but...
Y-You think so...?
I'm back!
Where did you two go?
Lucy's room.
We picked up the bottle of ointment and her Celestial Keys.
I see! I can ask my Celestial Spirits for help!
Thank you, Wendy and Carla!
But which Spirit should I summon?
I don't think I could count on Loke or Aquarius at a time like this...
Lucy, call out Gemini.
Gemini? Why?
They can transform into you. Just try it!
O-Okay. Gate of the Twins, I open thee! Gemini!
Long time no see! Gemini here!
Oh, it's Lucy!
Looks exactly like Lucy!
That's Gemini for you!
So... let's do this!
I'm Lucy! Everyone, please be my friend!
We can keep this up forever!
I get it! Nice idea!
This doesn't solve anything!
Still, that's the spitting image of her...
Uh-huh! I transform into an exact duplicate.
I can even copy memories and abilities!
In that case, why don't we just say this is the real thing from now on?
Yeah. After all, the looks and powers are the same...
If anything, this one seems more mild-mannered and easier to get along with...
Enough!
Kidding! Only kidding!
Fried and Levy, what are you doing?
Analyzing the formulation of the recipe...
If we find out the makeup of the magic,
there may be Runes that can cancel it out.
I've got it analyzed.
Fried, these are the ointment's ingredients.
Leave the rest to me!
The effects of a magical ointment will be dispelled...
H-Hey, can you see anything?
N-No...
Does that really work?!
It does.
However, the ointment was sitting for seven years...
So it'll take seven years to be dispelled.
I can't wait that long!
I-I'm sorry, Lu-chan...
What's so funny, Lucy?
I'm crying! Because this is hopeless!
What's this? Not only my body, but now the clothes are becoming invisible?
Your whole existence is starting to disappear!
What does that mean, Levy?!
It's not just Lu-chan becoming invisible,
but she's actually starting to vanish!
On top of that, it will be as if she never existed.
The bottle disappeared?!
Since it'll be as if Lucy never existed, then her things will vanish, too!
I bet her room is empty by now!
I-I don't want this to happen! I don't want it so I never existed!
I'm right here!
If I do this...
What was I just saying...?
I don't know... Probably about work...
I think I was painting something... but what was it?
I feel like someone was standing right here just a second ago...
I have the same feeling. Strange, isn't it?
I feel weird, like something is missing...
Me too... Is it just our imaginations?
Do you feel like that too, Natsu?
Mmm...
I dunno!
I'm right here!
Everyone, have you forgotten about me?!
Ah, well. Let's get to work.
Fried, sit down. I'm not done painting you.
Um... What kind of job would I be able to do?
Fine.
Natsu! I'm here!
Gray! Can't you hear me?!
Erza! Happy! Wendy! Carla!
Everyone!
It's no use. None of them can hear me...
Everyone's forgotten me...
Because I never existed...
Then it's just like I'm a ghost!
I don't wanna be a ghost!
Alright! What do you say we go to work?!
Happy! Lucy! Let's go!
Aye, sir!
Lucy...?
Lucy...
That's right! Lucy!
Our friend! Our teammate!
That's right, Lucy!
Lucy was here!
I remember!
Lucy-san!
Natsu... Everyone!
The magic was dispelled!
Maybe the effect of the ointment was nullified when Natsu remembered her!
Yeah, could be.
Well, like they say, magic takes heart.
And whether it's a little magic or a lot,
nothin' can break the bond of the guild!
You talk a good game, but the three of you didn't do a thing to help.
Thank you, Natsu!
When we go to work as a team, it's just gotta include you, Lucy!
Aye!
Sure, it was kind of fun being invisible,
but it was way too lonely when my friends didn't notice I was there.
I can't always count on them, but they're all my dear friends.
I wanna get rid of this quick.
I'm so glad you're back, Lucy!
Natsu!
Hey!
What is this?!
Where'd my face go?!
Who are you?!
It's me! Who the hell are you?!
Maybe I do wish everyone was a little more level-headed...
Natsu, have you seen Elfman?
He went out on an errand for Mira.
I wish I had a little brother, too...
So I could send him out shopping for me,
and carry my things for me,
and on top of that, I'd get the right to have one more fish than him!
Next time: Father's Memento.
Is that how you see those two?
Isn't it like that?
Your mind is too warped, Happy...
