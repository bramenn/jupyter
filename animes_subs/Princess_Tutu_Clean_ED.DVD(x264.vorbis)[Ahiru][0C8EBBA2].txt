Yume miru you ni koi o shita no
Fukuramu kokoro ga fukuramu no yo
Ikiteru tte suteki na koto to omotta
Asu ga machidoushii
Anata no chikara ni naritai no
Donna toki ni mo watashi
Matte matte kurenai
Hashitte hashitte yuku no yo
Kaze mo amagumo mo oikoshite
Watashi dake no tsubasa habataite
I loved like I was dreaming
It swells... My heart swells
I thought how wonderful it was to be alive
I can't wait for tomorrow
I want to be there for you
At all times
Wait, it won't wait
Running, running along
Passing by even the wind and the rain clouds
Just beating my own wings
