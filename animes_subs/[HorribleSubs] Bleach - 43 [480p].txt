Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
My love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Youre not going to sleep yet? Youre going to make yourself sick.
Yeah, just a little bit more
Hows Tsubakis recovery?
Not yet
That time, I
Tsubaki! Koten Zanshun! I reject!
Tsubaki!
Fool! Faltering like that!
Tsubaki
I had already lost my will to fight.
Sorry, Orihime.
Healing one of our own requires a certain knack.
Im so sorry
Itll be okay, Orihime.
Your Shunshun Rikka have incredible powers.
Indeed! Any doubt in your heart directly influences our powers,
so you need to be strong, Orihime!
But
Well practice some more!
So that you can ditch the Kotodama Spirit Chant,
and summon us by just the attack names!
If you can do that, we will be able to protect you faster!
Y-Yeah
W-What is it?
Just wait a little longer Ill be better in no time.
U-Uh-huh!
Are you ready?
Yep Im ready. Lets go.
This may have been for the best
Being with her these past days, its become very apparent.
Orihime is definitely not suited for combat!
She hates seeing others get hurt more than anything.
Even if it is the enemy
A person like that shouldnt fight.
For that kind of fighting will only bring harm to herself and her comrades.
Hey! You guys!
Wait a minute!
What are you guys doing over here?!
What squad are you with?
Squad Eleven.
Oh? Thats odd Im with Squad Eleven, too, but
In our squad that specializes in combat,
this is the first time Ive ever seen a dimwit walking around
without carrying his zanpaku-to!
Oh no! So each squad had distinctive traits!
Thats Squad Twelves emblem. Not ours
Guess you wouldnt know, huh?
Who the heck are you guys?
Damn I had hoped we could keep going quietly,
but I have no choice!
That was close, you guys!
Were you hurt?
Of all things, doubting your own comrade, what a jerk!
This guys drunk!
T-Thank you very much!
Its okay, were in the same Squad Twelve,
so its expected that we help each other.
These guys will pick any excuse to come next door to mess with us. Damn it!
When youre rushed,
its possible to forget even your sword sometimes!
Here, this way!
Well walk you back to quarters. Sounds good!
Wait Think about it
Isnt it strange for them to help us in this situation?
Even though he was drunk, what that man said was perfectly logical.
For what reason would these guys go out of their way to help us?
Orihime! Get away
Wh-Why
Captain! This isnt what we agreed upon!
Our role was to just talk to them,
then bring them back to quarters.
Oh, no. Then why this...
A released bomb shouldnt return. How could you do this, Captain?!
Captain-!
A shield?!
Thank you. If you hadnt screamed out
No, we survived
because youve been practicing all this time.
Wh-What about the others?
Unfortunately
But, thats not something you should feel guilty about.
The one who should feel guilty, howeveris you!
Oh!
This is an interesting technique! That shield
Is it the work of that woman behind you?
I have no intention of answering you.
How interesting!
Thats the first time Ive seen that technique!
How about it, woman!
Wont you work for me as a research subject?
Dont be ridiculous!
I said I have no intention of answering you!
Should you work for me, I wont do you wrong!
Rest assured! Im gentle with the ladies.
Shes crying?
Why is she crying?!
Is she afraid? No!
Be careful!
If she were afraid,
she wouldnt have risked danger just to save me!
Then why? Is she crying for those guys that died just now?!
Besides, why did she save me?!
Im the enemy! Whats in it for her to save me?
II just dont get it.
I know! Ill offer you my best working conditions!
Ill limit drug therapies to eight times a day!
And mechanical experiments up to five times a day!
Ill even do my utmost to refrain
from performing surgeries which may be life-threatening!
How about it?
Rather exceptional terms for an experimental subject, I should think.
Hes fast.
Oh A Quincy, huh?
Such a rarity. Its been years since Ive seen a live specimen.
But Im sorry, Ive finished researching your kind already.
So Im no longer interested in your kind. Step aside there!
Finished researching? What do you mean by that?
What are you?
What? You Ryokas dont bother to investigate first
and just storm into your enemys base?
How careless
At the very least, you should commit to memory
the names of the thirteen top people, I should think.
Captain of Squad Twelve,
as well as the second-generation Chief of Research and Development,
Mayuri Kurotsuchi.
You dont have to remember that though.
Pretty soon, you wont know anything anyway.
This guy
Orihime!
Run! Hurry!
No!
Ill fight too!
Hey, you from Squad Eleven! Take Orihime and run!
Y-Youve got to be kidding! Why me?
You dont want to die, do you?
If you drag your feet, youll be caught in the crossfire!
Take her away by force, if necessary! Otherwise
Ill shoot you!
Hurry!
D-Damn it!
Come on, Missy!
No!
Did I say you could run away?
Did I say you could go after them?
My, my Im not interested in you.
Letmego!
Please let me go! Ouch, ouch, ouch! Oh, no, I cant!
I, Makizo Aramaki, a ten-year member of Squad Eleven,
also known as Maki-Maki!
I am a compassionate man
who wont leave behind women and children, even if I were asked to!
Why, you
Sorry about that.
I have no intention of getting caught up in that freak Kurotsuchis fight or
getting shot by that four-eyed jerk
So I had to be a bit rough there Maybe I was a bit too rough
Maybe I should apologize when she wakes up
My, my It takes quite an effort to get this set up
He took his own arm off?!
It hurts It sure does hurt
It hurtsand it hurts
So much that my minds about to melt.
It seems that the woman has gotten away.
Oh well. If theres even a single strand of her hair left on the ground,
thats enough to track her down.
I cant wait to capture and examine her until she turns to mush.
I hate to lose even a minute or a second.
Monster
There are two enemies
If Kurotsuchi is the captain,
then is that woman behind him his lieutenant?
She hasnt moved even though her superior has a bow pointed at him
does that mean her combat abilities are low?
If sothen I should start with the captain!
That guy?!
Pretty good
Nice moves youve got there.
The previous one and the one just now
That was the Hiren Kyaku,” right?
An advanced Quincy move that involves moving at high speed
by creating a current of spiritual energy beneath the feet.
I never expected a young person like you to have been trained in it.
Youre pretty good. Seems youre quite talented
I couldnt outrun him!
However, its a bit of a bother to have you running around me like that
After this, I need to capture that woman and conduct my research.
Im busy, you see So at this time
Ill have to use a method with the least effort
to kill you.
Claw out
Ashisogi Jizo.
What are its abilities?
If theyre the type that absorb attacks
Then I cant attack it head on!
Damn it!
Wha-?!
This ones attacking!
L-Let go!
It cant be!
No way
He really attacked his subordinate
Isnt she a part of his team?
Why?
You idiot!
I thought I taught you to hold on, even if your arms were ripped out!
M-My deepest apologies.
Oh well Its not like I expected much from you in the first place.
At least we got this far.
From here, itll take no more effort than strangling a baby.
He really sacrificed his subordinate just to kill me!
Youre sweating quite a bit.
It must hurt. Without even crying out you bear your pain
Youve got some will.
Its not the first time you were cut by a sword?
Its my second time!
Ohso youre quite experienced. How nicehowever
Geez, what a noisy one.
My deepest apologies
Sir Mayuri May I have some of the Hojiku-zai as well?
The wounds seem to extend to my lungs At this rate
I may not be able to sustain my life-force
What?!
You! Are you insulting me?! Eh?! Are you?!
Your body! With just that cut?! Youre saying its no good?!
Stop it!
What are you doing?
Isnt she part of your group? Shes really going to die!
And are you insulting me also?
You think shell die from just this?
This body which I created?!
With a wound of that degree! You think shell cease to function?!
Youd better be careful of whom you insult!
You Created?
Thats right. Let me tell you her name.
Nemu Kurotsuchi.
By melding the quintessence of my gigai techniques and gikon techniques
I created this masterpiece.
So dont go parading your creepy sense of justice around here.
How I decide to use this thing,
for a stranger such as you, its none of your business!
Stop it!
Itit wont move!
Just realizing it now? Pretty dense, arent you
From whatever it cuts, this robs the mobility of its four limbs.
That is the ability of this Ashisogi Jizo.”
A paralyzing poison, huh?...
Dont be ridiculous. Its not something that primitive.
Of the countless signals fired from your brain,
it selectively severs just the signals controlling the movement of your limbs.
Such a sophisticated drug is what it produces.
Its not paralysis.
It robs only the movement of the limbs, in other words
Not an ounce of pain is lost.
Hey, Nemu! Get up! Youre going to strike the final blow!
Nemu! Oh yeah, thats right
You were cut with this also, so you cant move either!
Damn! Youre useless!
Cut it out
What?
I said, stop it!
Persistent, arent you? Or is it something else?
Showing mercy to wounded women, even if they were the enemy,
is that the pride of the Quincy that you all are so fond of?
What?
You are fond of it, arent you?
Because you all keep saying that line until the moment you die.
By the pride of the Quincy, I cannot do that!
By the pride of the Quincy, I wont allow that!
Its so annoying! Each and every one of you!
Regardless, with one thrust of this,
any words of resistance will become meaningless.
You
Now hold on. This is the story of my hardships...
When I became the Chief of Research and Development,
the Quincy were already a rare breed
We had put surveillances on the surviving members.
Well, purposely delaying rescue of that which you guard,
just to obtain the konpaku,
Can you understand? Just how difficult this was?
But even with all that effort, there werent any decent research specimens.
The last specimen I had was a grubby old man.
He kept calling his apprentices or grandsons name the whole time.
It was so creepy
Do you want to see his picture?
Its after the experiments, so his original form wasnt maintained.
What was the name of his apprentice?
Goodness
It seems once my experiments are concluded, I lose all interest
Whats that?!
The name of his apprentice
Do you want me to tell you?
The name of his apprentice is Uryu Uryu Ishida.
This person is Soken Ishida He was my teacher
As well as my grandfather!
Oh And?
Im glad Orihime isnt here.
This is one battle that I wouldnt want her to see.
By the pride of the Quincy, I will kill you!
Happy people
Come on, come on, come on
Happy people
Here we go!
Everybody stand up! Everybody fight!
Within your heart, you may feel uneasy
But keep your head right up!
To the sky!
No matter when (Oh yeah!)
No matter where (Oh yeah!)
Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!)
Ill be here for you
Happy people in the house!!!
With a tough smile
Happy people in the house!!!
Lets live!
Wow
Happy people in the house
All right
Happy people
Lately, it feels like my appearances have been diminishing
Do not fret.
Yoruichi.
You shall have no appearances in the next episode either.
Ishida is going to do his best by himself.
Leave it to me.
If you do not master the Bankai soon,
perhaps you may never have another turn.
I-Ill do my best!
