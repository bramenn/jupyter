Lucy! You can hear me, can't you?!
Hold on! I swear I'll get you outta here!
Warning. Another one of the engraved seals has been removed.
If the remaining three disappear, the owners will lose the right of possession.
Lucy! Get a hold of yourself!
Struggle how you might, it's pointless.
In mere moments, Lucy Heartfilia will merge with the Infinity Clock.
And when that happens, it'll become possible for us to take control of Real Nightmare.
What?!
I won't let anyone lay a hand on Nee-san.
She's going to stay with me forever.
Forever...
For eternity...
Recently on Fairy Tail...
While we were fighting with Legion over the memento from Lucy's dad,
the new Oracion Seis appeared before us.
They stole the Infinity Clock and abducted Lucy.
We handpicked members headed for Infinity Castle to try to stop Real Nightmare.
If we can defeat all Six Generals barring our way, we'll be able to stop Real Nightmare.
Right now, there are three left!
Happy birthday, Lucy.
Thank you, Mama, Papa, everyone!
Everyone...?
Michelle's not here...
Oh, that's right. She said that was all a lie...
Natsu! What's going on over there?!
How's Lucy?!
If we don't hurry,
Lucy's gonna be swallowed up by the Infinity Clock!
Say what?!
I Can Hear the Voices of My Friends!
Lucy is merging with the Infinity Clock?!
That must be why we can't reach her by telepathy!
Is there anything we can do?
You need to rest a little!
Listen, everyone!
Hurry up and beat Oracion Seis!
If Lucy becomes one with the Infinity Clock, it'll be too late!
I can hear it...
You need to take me down without a moment to spare,
so my engraved seal on the Infinity Clock will be erased...
Give it up, Titania!
Give up. I don't know what those words mean!
Even if you're defeated, you still have friends, eh?
You can rely on them, but you won't beat me!
Requip!
In order to receive our new powers, we each lost something irreplaceable!
For Erigor, it was his memories.
For Racer, it was his heart!
And Angel, her lifespan!
What you scum lack is the resolve to lose something important!
No one can surpass the weight upon our hearts!
Who is this?
Romeo! What are you doing over there?!
I stowed away on Christina.
At a time like this, there was no way I was gonna stay home!
Idiot! I know how you feel, but this time...
Romeo-san, can you hear me?!
Yeah!
Anyway, meet up with somebody.
Either way, there's no time!
They have to beat the remaining Oracion Seis members and save Lucy!
Which way should I go?
I'll tell you the route Natsu and the others took, so head that way!
Got it!
Happy! Lily!
Yes?! I can hear you!
We're headin' that way, too!
I'm counting on you!
Anyway, stop Samuel!
Roger!
Aye, sir!
What is the archbishop's condition?
Byro!
Hey! Where's Gildarts?!
He descended into the depths with his comrades.
I expect he's okay...
More importantly, do you know what happened to Samuel and the others?
You have no more reason to go after Lucy!
If we defeat all Six Generals, their seals will disappear.
And if that happens...
But you're too late to stop Lucy Heartfilia from merging with the Infinity Clock.
Am I wrong?
We don't...
There is still a way.
Your Grace!
I had a... trying nightmare for the longest time...
It had nothing to do with my own will. I was controlled like a puppet,
which brought this situation on.
However, taking no heed of the danger, these people rescued me.
But even though I was manipulated, I saw from the enemy's viewpoint,
and amid this chaos...
Um...
There's something we'd like you to tell us!
Archbishop, you know a lot about the Infinity Clock, right?
You want to know about the captured Celestial Spirit Wizard, don't you?
You say you wanna be with Lucy forever?
What about Lucy's feelings?!
She trusted you, and even after she realized you betrayed her,
she wants to believe in you again.
Can't you hear that voice?!
There's nothing to hesitate over.
You're just trying to take back what you lost... Imitatia.
Michelle!
I'm sure Nee-san will be happier this way!
After all, we were always together!
Liar!
Romeo!
Why are you still lying?!
You're not the real Michelle!
Even if you were always together, it was a big lie!
That's not true! I was...
After Lucy-nee lost her family, imagine how happy she was when she met you!
Why did you betray her?! Why did you tell such an awful lie?!
She believed that you were her friend...
Me too... I thought you...
Goddamn it!
Romeo-kun...
You can't let them shake you, Imitatia-sama.
Anyone who stands in your way is an enemy.
Say something... Michelle!
Do it.
Romeo!
Dammit...
I got it, Michelle.
Figuring out who the hell you are can wait'til later.
Right now, I'm gonna kick your ass an' save Lucy.
Natsu...
Oh, my! This should be an amusing spectacle!
Don't shy away, Imitatia.
You're the new Oracion Seis's number two.
I'll make your prayers come true.
But first, show me your allegiance.
Michelle...
Stop this!
Wench...
I knew you could do it.
All you need think about is your most fervent wish, living together with Lucy Heartfilia for eternity...
Now, finish him off.
I'll do whatever is needed to make your prayer come true.
Bind that man, my vines!
Please, stop...
Warning. Murderous intent detected nearby, approaching rapidly...
Murderous intent?
Samuel!
What are you doing?!
Lucy Heartfilia!
I'll stop the Infinity Clock by spilling your blood!
Coco, move!
No!
I don't have time to argue with you!
Then tear through me with those claws first!
You... I'm not doing this for the sake of church doctrine!
I'm following my own heart...
Even though you know it's wrong?!
That's right.
But to put an end to this chaos, I have no other choice!
Why, you...!
You...
Leave this to me.
You guys!
Is that the answer you arrived at?
I'm gonna wipe that decision to take a life right out of your head!
Nii-san!
Happy!
Sammy!
Lucy, wake up!
Hey! Can you hear me?! Lucy!
But I can't do anything...
Everyone is lying on the ground in front of me...
I can't move my body...
I don't want this...
I want to help everyone!
Tears...
She can hear our voices!
Lucy's fightin', too!
This showdown ain't over yet!
Damn, he's stubborn! This is why I said he should be taken out for good!
Hmph. Whatever he tries to do, it's too late.
You people have no chance.
Why?
Why do you want power that badly?
Is spreading chaos and destruction and getting revenge that important to you?!
It is.
If I don't accomplish this, I won't be able to look Cubelious in the face!
I have nothing else left to lose.
I threw away everything, so I'm afraid of nothing.
There's nothing you can do, Titania!
Everyone, listen! There's a way to slow down the merging of Lucy and the Infinity Clock!
The archbishop will explain, so listen carefully!
His Grace?!
To merge with a sacrificial Celestial Spirit Wizard,
it takes a telepathic bond to be formed with the person and her sense of time.
In other words, it must integrate with her memories.
For that, the chains descending from the Infinity Castle to the ground spread Real Nightmare,
while at the same time taking in the land's magic power and all memories.
Put another way, you can buy some time by cutting the chains!
Byro and Zentopia's monk soldiers already left!
Everyone, destroy the chains!
They look like they'll be filling!
Could you hear that?
Yes. I heard it, too.
Nii-san. I...
Forget it. Everybody makes mistakes.
So did I.
What's important...
Let's snap those chains, Sammy!
Yeah! Let's have a contest to see who can chop through the most, Nii-san!
Talons of the Fire Dragon!
What tenacity! This is the power of your feelings?!
Looks like I still had a chance, huh?!
A faint hope at best.
Go ahead, do your worst.
I'm going to dispose of you in one stroke.
Cubelious... I'm going to use...
Is this the second generation?
Decay and die, Titania!
Roar of the Poison Dragon!
What?!
This ancient weapon is said to keep evil at bay!
I see. I can use it like this, too...
I guess you can't ask about what you don't know, huh?
I didn't expect you'd pull that out at the eleventh hour!
Try listening to my heart.
Take me with you?!
Sever the chains... You intend to bring us both down?!
Starting with one!
Two!
Damn you!
Yeesh, that tastes like shit...
She's in high spirits, too!
I can't let her outdo me!
We're heading to the next chain! Hurry!
I heard the archbishop's voice!
This doesn't have to do anything with a guild or Legion!
I'm just doing this to correct my mistake!
That's my fifth one!
I did seven!
Calling me... He's calling me!
I'm getting closer and closer!
I can hear him!
That voice...
Cobra...
You said you're strong because you lost everything, yes?
But that's not true strength!
What are you talking about?!
People get stronger when they've got something to protect!
If you've got a real friend, they support you!
But you only think about yourself! Could you really hear the voice of your friend?!
You don't feel shame now when you think of your friend or whatever?!
Silence!
It seems you went too far!
But it's as far as you get. I'm gonna crush your head!
Cubelious!
Don't tell me... But... I sense her...
Her form has changed... but I can hear her thoughts!
This can't have been a mistake! There's no way!
I didn't expect you to lose your composure in the heat of battle...
Crap!
Feelings for friends don't drag you down.
You actually realize it, too, don't you...
That's right. You can hear the voice of your friend.
Could you throw everything away that easily?
I heard it...
I just heard his voice...
A shooting star...
That's it! It must be!
He's come to get me!
Warning. Another engraved seal has been erased.
There are two left.
Cobra-sama is down?! I don't believe it!
Yay!
Alright! Now I just gotta mop the floor with you guys!
You really are a tenacious man.
But you're only buying time.
You're not having any effect on the big picture.
What my father left undone... The destruction of everything that has form...
And bringing about nothingness and chaos...
It didn't work seven years ago.
But this time, I won't let you interfere, Natsu Dragneel.
Natsu!
I'll tell you one thing.
The Infinity Clock girl that you're trying to save...
It's already too late to save her.
100 years of sleep is as simple as falling off a log.
Lucy Heartfilia is becoming part of the Infinity Clock,
and when it's done, she'll lose her body and mind, too.
And once she's become a piece of the clock, she'll be erased from everyone's memories as well.
Her very existence will be wiped off the face of Earthland.
Erased... What?
I mean, Nee-san is going to be together with me...
She won't leave you.
She's just going to become a tool.
You can be with her as much as you like.
It'll work out well. For someone like you, she'll be the perfect partner.
No...
No!
What I wished for...
What I prayed for...
That's not it!
Nee-san!
What do you think you're going to do?!
Get away!
Move!
Nee-san... I...
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Michelle...
Cry a lot...
Eat a lot...
Kind of clumsy...
I don't have any dreams.
If it doesn't prick your conscience, anyone could easily make those choices, right?
Michelle was also suffering...
Oh, no, no. This is no good.
It's nonsense.
Imitatia, your role is finished.
Return to garbage!
Nee-san!
Nee-san...
I'm sorry...
I love you!
Yes... I remember.
No, not that. That's not it. I...
Back to... the way it was?
Yeah!
Somewhere along the line, I realized...
This girl was my precious little sister...
Pathetic, filthy doll...
Please, stop that... You'll get your shoe dirty! Good one, huh?!
You...
Natsu-nii!
Come and get me!
Is it that funny to you when someone's sad?
In that case, I'll beat you'til you won't even be able to crack a smile!
Uh-oh! At this rate, Lucy's gonna...
There's just one left! Brain II!
Yeah. But it feels like his hatred is stronger than anyone else's in Oracion Seis.
Even so, we're not gonna lose!
We're carrying the combined will of everyone in Fairy Tail on our shoulders as we fight him!
Next time: Lucy and Michelle!
You're right.
Although I'm the one that's fightin'!
You have to bring that up now?!
I'm not gonna let you get away with just soundin' cool!
