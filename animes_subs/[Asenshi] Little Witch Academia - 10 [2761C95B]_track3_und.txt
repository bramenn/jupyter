The be-in...
Why not return it?
Like Akko.
What's with your outfits?
His son, Lord Andrew, earned the egregia cum laude distinction at his prestigious school.
A party is being held to celebrate this occasion.
A party is being held in his honor.
The Hanbridge and Cavendish families descended from a long and respected noble bloodline.
Only nobles and the affluent are invited to the Earl's manor!
Little Miss Dunce over here with her ice cream-smeared cheeks will have to put up with watching from the sidelines.
Little miss dunce over here should just enjoy the ice cream smeared on her cheeks and grind her teeth in anger!
Not really, couldn't care less.
Taking that on the chin without a fight would put the good name of witches to shame!
Taking that without a fight would put the good name of witches to shame!
I will go!
I'll go even if it kills me!
Yes, all of us! And that includes you two.
Could you make an exception?
Well then...
Fine, how about this, then?
Fine, how about this?
This was our best seller a century ago.
I'll throw in a Snow White set and knock the whole shebang down to half price if you buy now. How about it?
Buy now and I'll throw in a Snow White set, and I'll even knock the whole shebang down to half price!
Bubbidi!
B-Bubbidi?
I get it. No wonder he couldn't sell them out.
His and Her Excellencies, Rodester. We have been eagerly awaiting you.
There's no way we'll be able to get in there.
You're magnificent, Lord Andrew. Not just anybody can be the top student at Appleton Academy.
You have proved to be an admirable son. Earl Hanbridge's expectations for you were well met.
You are a respectable son. Earl Hanbridge's expectations for you were well earned.
One day you will surely follow his footsteps and become a great politician.
Well don't you have quite the sour look on your face, Andrew.
Regrettably, I must request your departure.
You're planning to throw me out?!
Witches, obsolete and bogus as they are, have no place here.
Outdated and phony witches have no place here.
Let it be, Andrew. What could be a more amusing surprise than a visit from these witches?
Come on, Andrew. What could be a more pleasant surprise than a visit from these witches?
Unfortunately, I hate surprises.
There must have been something wrong with me.
Why would I ever send you home?
My thoughts must have been in disarray. Ever since the moment I first laid eyes on you...
You had nestled yourself a place in my heart.
Please let me be with you.
You're the one who said we should try it on someone.
I spy a cutie!
How should we refer to you?
There's nothing better than toying with you, Akko.
Akko, toying with you is the best.
I must find my outlet for this restlessness in my chest.
Why not enjoy it? It's the first time you've ever been coveted.
This is the first time someone's had their eye on you.
Oh yeah, this is the first time!
Oh yeah, this has never happened before!
And it probably won't happen again.
And it probably never will again.
True, it probably won't
True, I'll never again
If you squish the lovelove bee with this, its spell will probably be broken.
It seems you opened our gates to a witch of Luna Nova.
Are you aware of my prejudice against witches?
We politicians must be the ones to consolidate power for our nation.
Witches are unnecessary.
That is what politics does. You have a bad habit of getting engrossed in trivialities.
That's politics. You have a bad habit of getting engrossed in unnecessary things.
I recall you wishing to play piano as a child.
I haven't touched a piano in ten years, as you instructed.
It's only natural. You are to become the man who leads this country.
You have no need for effeminate music.
Remove the witches. Am I clear?
How about removing this witch?
Just like you threw the piano out from your life.
I had no idea you were so spineless. You're no more than your father's puppet.
I have a duty to succeed my father as a politician.
I may just be a little witch right now, but I have fun every day chasing my dream.
Just imagining Chariot's smile is enough to make my whole world filled with rainbows!
Not like a certain someone here would understand...
Though a certain someone probably can't understand.
That's not how you really feel. It's just because you were stung by that magic bee.
Are you all right?!
It's only natural. I'm perfect.
Let's get out of here. There aren't any worthwhile girls anyway.
Come along, let's return home.
But then I realized it when I saw her sad smile.
She's the sort of kindhearted girls you rarely find nowadays.
She's a kindhearted girl you rarely find nowadays.
My father is an excellent politician.
That's not true. Akko, how about you?
The fallin...
I ordered a venomous bee, but they sent this one by mistake.
Anyone who gets stung by this bee will fall in love with the first person they see.
The first person?
Will you return it?
Since we've got it, why not try it out on someone first?
Like who?
Maybe Akko.
The fallin lovelove bee, huh.
Well, if it isn't Akko.
What's with those outfits?
We've received an invitation to the Earl of Hanbridge's manor.
His son, Lord Andrew, just earned unparalleled honors at his prestigious school.
A party is being held to celebrate the occasion.
For Andrew?
Andrew Hanbridge.
Run away!
I didn't expect that thing to be inside!
Honestly, you've got a fantastic school here!
How lovely!
You're going too, Diana?
Why wouldn't she be?
The Hanbridge and Cavendish families share a long and illustrious noble bloodline.
Their families have been linked for over five hundred years.
I cannot embrace this.
I would much rather be studying than wasting time at a party.
Hannah, Barbara, let us plan to leave early.
Are you jealous?
Don't you want to go to the party?
Never ever, ever, ever!
Only nobility and the affluent are invited to the Earl's manor!
Little Miss Dunce can just stay here and wash away the ice cream on her cheeks with tears of frustration.
Damn them!
Doesn't that piss you off, Sucy? Lotte?
Not really. Couldn't care less.
Let's go, Akko.
I will! To the party!
Huh?
Just taking that on the chin would put the good name of witches to shame!
I'm going, and that's final!

The first thing we need are dresses. Magic dresses that'll make us the life of the party!
Little Witch Academia
Little Witch Academia
Us?
Yes, we're going! And that includes you two.
R-Right...
So you want magic dresses...
Everything I've got is way out of reach for you.
Could you change that?
Well, then...
How's this?
What about this?
Then this one.
Fine, then how about this?
A Cinderella set?
This was our bestseller a century ago.
With a wave of your wand and the magic words, you, too, can become Cinderella.
Buy now and I'll throw in a Snow White set, and even knock the whole shebang down to half price!
All right, you've got a deal!
Okay, let's do this!
Bubide!
B-Bubbi-babbi?
Boo.
This is supposed to be our carriage?
It says here the magic will run out in two hours.
I get it. No wonder he was sitting on that shelfwarmer.
The Lord and Lady Rodester. We have been eagerly awaiting your arrival.
Look, that's it! Earl Hanbridge's manor!
There's no way we'll be able to get in there...
Leave it to me!
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Now's our chance!
It's like a dream!
We've stepped into a world straight out of a girl's fantasies.
Thank you for being present as we honor my son, Andrew.
Andrew...
Such a magnificent feat, Lord Andrew. Not just anybody can be the top student at Appleton Academy.
That makes three consecutive years.
You have proved to be an admirable heir. Earl Hanbridge's expectations for you were well placed.
One day, you will surely follow his footsteps and become a formidable statesman.
I wish for nothing more.
Pardon me.
You don't look like you're having the most pleasant day, Andrew.
There's no point in wasting time with formalities.
Diana!
Do you remember me? I'm Frank.
Andrew's schoolmate, I believe.
You become more beautiful each time I see you.
Your studies appear to be progressing well.
I feel privileged that you would take precious time out of your so-called magic education to visit me, Diana.
Diana and Andrew are so picturesque together.
They're both nobles. We live in different worlds.
Th-That's right! They go perfectly together with their nasty personalities.
Akko?!
Wh-What a surprise to see you here!
What is possibly going through your mind?
You're the worst!
Why are you here?
I don't recall inviting you.
Y-Yeah, because you didn't!
Why would I even be considered?
But the fact is that I'm already here!
That makes me a full-fledged guest of yours!
Just the sort of twisted logic I would expect from a witch.
What was that?!
Regrettably, I must ask that you leave.
You want to throw me out?!
Witches, outdated and phony as they are, have no place here.
S-Sucy?
Andrew, can you really call yourself a noble with that intolerant attitude of yours?
Let it be, Andrew. What could be a more pleasant surprise than a visit from these witches?
Unfortunately, I hate surprises.
Andrew?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Andrew?
There must have been something wrong with me. Why would I ever send you home?
Huh?
My thoughts have been in disarray. Ever since the moment I first laid eyes on you...
You have been occupying a place in my heart.
Please let me be with you!
Forevermore.
N-No way...
It can't be...
This is...
D-Don't tell me!
You used the lovelove bee?!
Well, you're the one who said we should try it on someone.
W-Wait up!
Andrew's fallen head over heels.
This is a first.
C-Come back!
Come back!
Sweetest young lady!
What is your name?
How may we refer to you?
Um, I'm Lotte Jansson.
Lotte Jansson!
Lotte!
Tell me about yourself!
I-I don't think I'm a particularly interesting person.
Your hobbies are?
Are you betrothed?
Give me your hand!
I love you, Lotte!
There it is!
Diana, I'm coming too!
May I have this dance, Akko?
Y-You must be joking.
Profess your love, with lips so fine.
You've lit my fire, you must be mine.
Get away from me!
Sucy, do something about this!
There's nothing in the world better than toying with you, Akko.
You idiot!
Please wait, Akko!
Akko!
Little Witch Academia
Little Witch Academia
I must find relief from this pounding in my chest.
What do we do?
Why not enjoy it?
This is the first time you've ever been desired.
Oh yeah, it is the first time!
And it's likely the last as well.
True, I'll probably never
Hey, that's not the issue here!
We've only got another hour until the Cinderella set's magic wears off!
If you squish the lovelove bee with this, you can probably break its spell.
So I've just gotta squish it with this!
There's no mistake.
That was a lovelove bee.
Where'd it go?
Diana!
Have you seen a bee? A weird-looking one.
Diana.
Akko...
How could I have ever been so cold to you up until now?
No, look what you've made me say!
Andrew.
It seems you opened our gates to witches of Luna Nova.
Yes.
Are you aware of my antipathy towards witches?
Witches and magic are the evil relics of a bygone era.
We statesmen must be the ones to consolidate power for our nation.
Witches are without use.
You're saying we must abandon their dying breed?
That's politics. You have a bad habit of getting engrossed in useless things.
I recall you wishing to play the piano as a child.
Yes, as a matter of course. You are to become a leader of this country.
You have no need for effeminate music-making.
Remove the witches. Are we clear?
Wanna remove this witch here?
Just like you threw piano out from your life.
I had no idea you were so spineless. You're nothing but your father's puppet.
I highly respect my father.
He is an outstanding Minister of State as well as head of our family.
I have a duty to succeed my father as a statesman.
Really, a duty? Don't you have any dreams?
A dream you found on your own.
You couldn't possibly understand.
There are those chosen by fate who must bear the duty of a proud lineage.
I'm no noble, and I'm not rich either!
But I have a dream!
I want to be a brilliant witch!
I'll be the next Shiny Chariot!
I may just be a little witch right now, but I have fun every day chasing my dream!
Just imagining Chariot's smile is enough to fill my whole world with rainbows!
Not like a certain someone would understand.
What's with the smirk? Are you looking down on me?
You are truly bewitching.
Th-That's not how you really feel. It's just because you were stung by that magic bee.
Bee?
There it is!
Help me out! If I can squash that bee, you'll come back to your senses!
Hey, get back here!
Why you!
What is she doing?
What is the meaning of this?
She appears to be a witch of Luna Nova.
What?!
That's enough, Luna Nova witch.
I demand you leave the premises immediately.
Everyone, an incident has occurred.
At the moment, Miss Kagari is attempting to eliminate a dangerous bee.
A bee?
How horrid.
A-Andrew?
Play along.
Please enjoy this as she eliminates the bee.
Flight of the Bumblebee.
Where have you gone, Akko?
Who are you?
What is this ruckus?
Stop it! Sto
Hold still, Earl!
Got it!
I finally got it!
That was a piece of cake!
My Lord!
Not bad, Andrew! I didn't expect you to be a pro at piano.
Of course I am. I'm perfect.
Unlike someone as slovenly as yourself.
Guess the spell wore off.
What was I thinking?
Seriously.
Let's get out of here. There are no good girls around anyway.
I-I should've known. Of course this would happen.
Lotte.
Um... I think those clothes suit you a lot better.
I'm Frank. When's the next time you have off?
Do you want to visit the library?
Or is there anywhere else you'd like to go?
Um, you mean together?
I have the feeling we'd get along well.
How is it possible to be so beautiful?
Well, let's return home.
Lotte Jansson.
She's homely at first glance.
But then I saw her sad smile, and I realized...
She's the sort of kindhearted girl you rarely find nowadays.
What about you and Atsuko Kagari?
Don't be foolish.
At the very least, you didn't kick her out.
You ignored an order from your witch-hating father.
My father is a brilliant statesman.
However, that does not mean our opinions will always align.
So basically...
That girl has caught your interest.
What?!
Wait, Lotte! Frank asked you out, but you refused?!
Yeah. I'm happy he did, but I felt it'd be rude to go on a date with him before I developed any feelings.
I told him we should start as friends.
Lotte, I bet you think you don't need a boyfriend as long as you have night fall.
That's not true. So Akko, how about you?
Huh?
Did it make you happy to have a prince put the moves on you?
That was only because the bee stung him!
I know it put you on cloud nine.
Profess your love, with lips so fine. You've lit my fire, you must be mine.
There might come a day when Andrew says I love you for real.
No, no, no! That selfish, conceited guy would never say that!
Then you'd tell him?
No, no, no, no, no! Never, ever!
Seriously never! Even if I died!
Yeah, yeah.
It'll never happen!
