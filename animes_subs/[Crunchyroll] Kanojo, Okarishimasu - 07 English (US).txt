You're a rental girlfriend, aren't you?
I have to shut that girl up, no matter what!
Can I take this to mean you're admitting it, Mr. Fake Boyfriend?
You're admitting it, yes?
U-Uh, no, that's not it.
Goodbye.
Hey, wait!
Don't follow me!
Squish!
Perv!
Faking a girlfriend! Stalking! Sexual harassment!
You're found guilty on all three charges!
Don't expect a stay on your sentencing!
Right face!
I can't let her tell Kuri about Mizuhara!
Wait a second!
Stop following me.
I just live this way.
I don't want you following me all the way!
Why? Because you're gonna call Kuri?
Relax. I'm not going to tell Shun-kun.
R-Really?
But I can't trust that.
You're Kuri's girlfriend, so who knows how and when you'll let it slip?
Gosh, this is such a pain!
Hold on!
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I was told you two were a tight couple...
But then I learned she was a rental, so I just wanted to mess with you.
How'd you find that out?
Huh? W-Well, I can't tell you.
P-Please!
I bet you rented her for some shallow reason, anyway.
So why does it matter if people find out?
The thing is... I got dumped by my first-ever girlfriend not long ago.
So I got lonely and rented Mizuhara.
But I'm such an idiot, I went and introduced her to my family.
My gran was over the moon, because I've never been a popular guy.
Seeing her like that, I couldn't bring myself to tell her the truth.
So just... p-promise me that you won't tell anyone!
Voice Recorder
Why should I have to promise that?
Please! Just say, I, Sarashina Ruka, promise not to tell anyone!
I beg you!
Stop that.
Sorry, but I have no choice.
I'll do anything you want, so please!
Jeez... What is your deal?!
I was so sure that people who went for rental girlfriends were shallow and superficial!
W-Wait!
My, hello. Nice weather today, eh?
Oh, I'm sorry!
Wh-What do you think you're doing?!
You know I can't just watch my bud's girlfriend get hurt!
Please! If this gets out, it'll cause issues for Mizuhara, too!
I don't care about myself, but I don't want to see Mizuhara sad!
She may be a rental, but Mizuhara is...
Mizuhara is...
Mizuhara is...
the best girlfriend anyone could ask for!
I'm a rental girlfriend, too.
Now
You have a new message.
Where are you?
Mizuhara
You're late
I'm waiting for you
Mizuhara
When hwill hhyou hhhget hhhhhere hhhhh?
Mizuhara
When hwill hhyou hhhget hhhhhere hhhhh?
If you don't hurry up

Mizuhara
I'll charge you for an extension

Who does that girl think she is? A romcom heroine?

And that stupid virgin's pissing hme off, too!

Mizuhara.
What?!
A rental girlfriend?!
Y-Yeah.
That means she's less likely to tell Kuri.
But it's not out of the question, so we shouldn't provoke her.
Which agency's she with? I'm gonna complain!
There are things you just can't do, and putting a fellow pro at risk is one of them!
D-Don't yell at me over it.
Uh, so we're here at a restaurant together...
Is this allowed?
Isn't this just a normal date?
There! Found her!
You did?!

Sarashina Ruka, a younger-sister idol girlfriend.
Oh?
She's with an agency that operates within Tokyo, huh?
I was curious about how she found out,
but it makes sense if she's a rental girlfriend. She's probably searched my name before.
Huh? Are you famous or something?
Beats me.
Man, I don't know how to face Kuri next time I see him.
That's just it.
We have to feign ignorance all the way.
Sorry about this.
You're having to lend me an ear, even though we're not on a date or anything.
You really are a nice girl.
I'm leaving!
This was an emergency!
I would never see you without a booking otherwise!
R-Right.
I really, really can't have my grandma finding out about this job.
There's no guarantee that girl won't change her mind,
so let's keep an eye on those two as much as we can.
See you.
Yeah...
If anything happens, I need to sort it out!
Damn that Kuri...
I told him to meet me here at three!
omw
You're late
Almost there
I need to ask him when he's seeing Ruka-chan next.
I can't worry about coming off as awkward.
Huh? What's with that girl?
Who?
Whoa, she's a total cutie!
Oh, found you, Kazuya-san!
She knows him?
His sister?
They don't look alike.
Wh-What are you doing here?
Anyone can waltz into a college campus, huh?
Maybe people think I'm a student here.
When you're dressed like that?
This is just a costume.
There's no telling
This is bad news...
if she'll stick
What if Kuri shows up now?
to the story...
I'm here to see you, Kazuya-san.
Huh? Me?
K-Kuri!
Come with me!
Huh?
Have you guys seen Kazuya?
Yeah. He went that way with a super cute girl.
A girl?
We can't do this! If you wanna talk, let's do it off campus!
Give me a hug.
It was at 79. Almost there.
Kazuya?
Are you kidding me?!
That's weird... I thought I heard his voice.
Can that guy teleport or something?
Things are getting worse and worse...
This ain't the time to be messing with your phone!
I knew it... I was right!
He's gone... Thank God!
Give me a break.
How are we supposed to explain ourselves if he finds us together?
A-Anyway, you should leave for
What're you doing?
K-Kuri!
Wh-Why are the two of you together?
Y-You've got the wrong idea!
I-I just ran into Ruka-chan!
She's here to see you.
Right, Ruka-chan?
Kuribayashi-san, thank you for renting me the other day.
R-Ruka-chan?!
Cruel! She just murdered him in cold blood!
Kuri!
Sorry, you should leave.
Kuri!
Damn, I lost him.
Well, yeah, his friend just found out his girlfriend was a rental.
Of course he'd want to crawl into a hole.
Today him, tomorrow me
Ichinose
What? She said it?
In front of both of you?
Yeah... Not like there was another way to worm out of that situation.
But I feel so bad for Kuri-kun.
Still, this means he won't rent her anymore,
which reduces the chances of him finding out about us.
What is it?
Uh, something about that girl bothers me.
And what is that?
It was like she'd made up her mind about something.
She had this serious look on her face.
R-Ruka-chan?!
Wh-Why are you here?
When we passed by here on a date, Kuribayashi-san told me...
that you live here.
That voice was Chizuru-san, wasn't it?
Are you two neighbors?
Why are you two so close?
She's a rental girlfriend, isn't she?
You pay her to go on a date, and that's that!
That's the extent of your relationship, right?
H-Hey, Ruka-chan!
No!
No! I hate this!
I, Sarashina Ruka, promise here and now
that I won't tell anyone about your fake relationship or Mizuhara Chizuru-san's job!
But only if you go out with me, Kazuya-kun!
Rent - A - Girlfriend
What?
What?
Wait, what?
H-Hang on! How'd we get to that?
You're the first person to cross 90.
I like you!
I like you, Kazuya-kun!
Sh-She... likes... me?
What are you saying? You shouldn't mess with grown-ups like that!
You have no reason to fall for me!
I'm serious.
Between what happened on the ferry and the double date...
It shocked me to see how much you care for Chizuru-san.
If you care so much for a rental girlfriend,
then you're sure to treat a real girlfriend even better!
What are you talking about?
Mizuhara's just a rental...
Really?
Then you can go out with me!
I-I-It's not that simple.
But it is.
If she's just a rental girlfriend, there should be nothing in our way.
There's no way that's happening!
Me, date her?
Me...
date...
her?
M-Mizuhara? You sure you should be coming out?
She already knows.
There you are, puppet master.
Who're you calling a mastermind?
Do you realize what you're saying?
Like Kazuya-san said, we've only kept up this rental relationship because we had no choice.
Even if you're serious, telling him that out of the blue is only going to throw him off.
That's not true.
He's even grabbed my boob!
Wha?
Oh, uh, that wasn't what...
Squish!
What were you thinking?
Does any girl work for you, as long as she's cute?!
It's not what you think!
Has he ever grabbed your boobs, Chizuru-san?
Your boobs
Like hell!
Snicker
That means I've gotten further than you.
Excuse me?!
He embraced me without asking, then pushed me onto my back...
That and the boob thing happened at different times!
That doesn't make it okay.
That's not what I meant!
Anyway, just settle down.
We can't do this out here. What if someone sees?
You've got a point.
Don't touch me!
Look, I can explain!
I don't believe this.
You're even frequenting his apartment?
Wh-What do you mean?
If you're just a rental, wouldn't you hesitate to enter a client's apartment?!
But you just walked in, which proves you've done it before!
Right, she did come in back then.
Disgusting!! Scandalous!!
So much for just a rental!
Chizuru's a bad, bad lady I'm gonna tell her agency
You're getting down and dirty without telling your other clients or your agency!
Eep! That song's practically horror, Ruka-chan!!
I would never!
I'm sitting next to him!
I'm not letting anyone else by his side!
F-Feel free.
Five minutes.
Ruka-chan, give me five minutes to speak with Kazuya-san.
No way. Who knows what you'd do if I left you two alone?
Nothing!
R-Ruka-chan...
Yes?
Please give us some space, okay?
I can't say no to you, Kazuya-kun.
Grr
Grr!
Let's get this out of the way first.
Do you like Ruka-chan?
No, I don't!
That's inconsistent with her testimony.
L-Look, those were accidents!
I just don't know.
It's the first time anyone's told me they like me.
Any guy would find her cute, and I'm no exception.
But considering how Kuri'd feel, there's no way I could date her.
Got it. You shouldn't go out with her, then.
If you let her have her way now, she'll keep blackmailing you.
As the grown-up here, you need to face her without fear.
I didn't expect that.
I thought you'd say I should go out with her.
Why?
Remember what you said?
And the best way to do that would be for you to get a real girlfriend.
Let's get one thing straight.
Sure, that's my end goal,
but I can obviously understand you'd be against getting a girlfriend in this fashion.
Besides...
She's blackmailing you to go out with her. Makes me doubt if she really likes you.
The one thing a significant other can't lack is love for their partner.
We're not talking about a rental girlfriend here. It's not as simple.
But what now?
We need to do something to prevent her from spilling the beans.
I have an idea!
You'll tell Kuri-kun the truth?
Yeah. And now, he'll be willing to keep it on the down-low as a shared secret.
But...
All I'll tell him is that Mizuhara's a rental girlfriend.
That way, it won't affect your college life.
Nobody's realized that you go to our college.
Yeah, but...
I'll go see Kuri.
Now?
Yeah.
Given how he must be feeling,
he'd probably ignore my calls or texts.
I'll talk to him in person. You keep Ruka-chan occupied.
Are you sure? He'll find out you rented a girlfriend.
Well, I found out about him, so it's not fair that I get to keep my secret.
We can go get a drink and shoot the shit about rental girlfriends.
I'm sure it'll be a blast.
Mizuhara's right.
Dating her won't immediately put an end to this nightmare.
She put my feelings first.
So I need to...
Yes!
What are you doing?!
Ow! My back!
Hey, you okay?
Were you trying to run away?
You meanie!
Wait, Ruka-chan!
Are you sure about this?
I find it hard to believe that this will make you happy!
You wouldn't understand, Chizuru-san.
You have no idea just how long I've been looking for Kazuya-kun!
Wait!
God!
Ow!
Kazuya-kun!
Where do you think you're going?
Kuri!
To see Kuribayashi-san? Is that it?
You can't run away from me!
Give up and just go out with me!
I'll tell Kuribayashi-san everything! Is that what you want?!
I mean it!
Sorry! Please just give me a break!
I'll apologize if I gave you the wrong idea!
And you can hit me all you want!
H-Hey, don't do this outside.
Even if you really do like me,
I can't trample on Kuri's feelings like that!
Besides...
I really like Mizuhara!
So seriously, I'm sorry! But I just can't do it!
Why do you have to be that against the idea?
Even I know that doing this would only get me on your bad side.
But you two are so glued together, I didn't know what to do!
If you go out with me, I won't tell Kuribayashi-san anything, I swear!
He made a girl cry.
Scumbag.
Hey, can you stop crying for a second?
That's why I told you I was a rental girlfriend,
and that's why I broke it off with Kuribayashi-san!
I know that you like Chizuru-san!
I figured I had to do this to get you to date me!
No, you have that wrong, Ruka-chan.
I won't ask you to fall for me immediately,
and I don't mind if you only see it as a trial at first,
but please let me be your girlfriend!
Ruka-chan?
Huh? What?
Go out with her.
Huh?
Wh-Wh-What are you saying?
blah blah blah
I feel bad for you, but I don't want any more people finding out about my job.
Kuri-kun won't find out if nobody tells him.
B-But... wait... Mizuhara?
It looks like she really does like you.
Look at her crying. There's probably more to it than meets the eye.
Wh-What happened to what you were saying earlier?
What else are we supposed to do?
She's not likely to leave until you give her the okay!
W-Well, yeah...
She even knows our college.
It'd be too risky to leave her to her own devices.
She even said she was okay with a trial period.
What's wrong?!
Ruka-chan suddenly started hurting!
You shouldn't get any more excited.
You'll lose your breath again.
It's not that I shouldn't... I justhhhhhhhhhhh can't!hhhhhhhhhhh
That was crazy! I'm so hyped now!
My heart's racing!
Lub dub...
Lub dub...
Lub dub...
It's like...
I'm a robot or something...
Yuu-kun and I kissed for the first time yesterday...
Seriously? How'd it go?
My heart was about to jump out of my chest!
Love, huh?

And so I got a girlfriend.
Hello, all of you watching Rent-a-Girlfriend!
I, Sarashina Ruka, and Kazuya-kun are going out now,
so I'm going to be borrowing him from next week on...
The show needs to go on!
Besides, this is only a trial period.
What's your problem, Chizuru-san?
Can you stay out of our lovey-dovey preview?
Oh, I get it.
You're upset I stole Kazuya-kun from you, aren't you?
Anything but that.
M-Mizuhara?
Now, on the next episode of Rent-a-Girlfriend!
Christmas...
As for your Christmas present,
would I suffice?
