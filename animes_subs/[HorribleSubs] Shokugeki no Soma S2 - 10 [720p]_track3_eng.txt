The Second Plate
Episode 10
You don't look very happy, Eizan-kun.
What are you talking about?
The arena's really pumped.
This year's Autumn Elections are a major success.
As the organizers, there's nothing to be unhappy about.
But it looks very different from how you imagined it to be, doesn't it?
Hmph.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You're the one who directed Mimasaka Subaru to target Soma-kun, aren't you?
If he used Takumi-kun,
Soma-kun would no doubt agree to the Shokugeki.
If he were defeated before such a large crowd without being able to avenge his friend,
there would be no greater humiliation.
You kept your own hands clean,
and manipulated everything from behind the scenes.
It's very much your style, Eizan-kun.
But your schemes didn't work.
You used your wits to set up a trap for him the best you knew how,
but maybe you're the one who got caught and drowned instead.
What did you just say?!
I'd like you to have seconds, too.
Does no one want more?
It's the end of the line.
With this, we conclude the evaluation
If it means you'd have seconds,
I'd like you to pour this over the rice and dig in.
Hmm!
Well, to be more precise,
it wasn't only you.
Everyone at Totsuki felt the same way.
My Pacific saury dish is not yet complete.
That's...
A New Genius
Let's have seconds.
Yukihira-kun, you're free to struggle on till the very end,
but isn't this just a remake of the idea you used in your match against me?!
No, it's not, Alice.
It's
There, honored judges.
Porridge-Style Pacific Saury Rice.
Enjoy!
The slightly viscous soup
has soaked into the dish,
and gently melded with the rice.
There he goes!
Bare-chested!
Mild and creamy...
This white soup is soy milk!
That's right!
I gradually added miso and just a touch of Parmesan cheese to the soy milk,
then slowly simmered it until the soup became warm!
Soy milk?
You noticed, Alice.
The critical component of porridge is the broth.
He used soy milk as the broth, and built this dish on that foundation.
I see.
Broth is essentially umami itself.
Like kelp, soy milk contains large quantities of glutamic acid.
It is more than qualified to serve as the base for the porridge's flavor.
Further, umami components have a synergistic effect.
When two are present,
the resultant umami is far more than the sum of its parts.
The inosinic acid from Pacific saury
and the glutamic acid from soy milk...
Combining the two makes total sense.
A soy milk porridge...
How interesting.
There are ingredients that have suddenly
become prominent by adding the soup, as well.
What's mixed into the rice?
Crunchy pickled plums.
What?!
Crunchy pickled plums?
What?!
Not common snacks again?!
These plums serve as important accents.
The crunchy mouthfeel is fun, and it adds vivid visual impact!
For the taste buds, the plums help cut through the fattiness of the Pacific saury,
and provide a refreshing aftertaste.
The dish makes full use of the acidity's ability to increase appetite.
The plums were pickled in salt.
They are the perfect choice to complement the aged Pacific saury!
Another item of note is the Parmesan cheese in the soup!
This Western ingredient is combined with Japanese ingredients
such as the salted rice bran Pacific saury, pickled plums, and miso,
to create a brand new flavor!
It reminds me of when I met my beloved...
This way.
Oh!
An encounter made possible by two that have developed
in different countries and cultures...
A most unique encounter.
You've got to be kidding.
That's high praise right there.
Who knew that the transfer student would...
Did you see this Totsuki Sports issue?
According to the journalism club,
News Flash Totsuki Sports Autumn Election Finals
they can distribute more copies
when they write an article bashing Soma-kun.
Of course they would.
He publicly said that this academy's just a stepping stone for him.
You can tell from the audience's reaction, too.
The transfer student is disliked not just in name, but in actuality.
Is that really true?
I don't think that's the only reason.
He had a very close spice match with Hayama-kun in the prelims.
Hayama Akira Yukihira Soma Kurokiba Ryo
In the main tournament,
he defeated Alice-kun, a relative of the Devil of Food.
Furthermore, he defeated Mimasaka-kun,
a monster who'd been undefeated in 99 Shokugekis.
Yet many students don't want to acknowledge Soma-kun.
Why is that?
You see, I've asked Soma-kun's father before.
Yukihira Diner
Dad!
I'm gonna become a chef who can beat you, Dad!
Oh, yeah?
Well, good luck.
Okay!
Let's do a cooking match right now!
In my eyes, Soma didn't have any special cooking skill.
Kids say that sort of thing,
so I thought he'd have enough once I beat him a couple of times.
But Soma never let himself get down.
Every time, he gets one step closer.
One day, I realized something.
Soma lacks something any normal person would have.
What do you mean by that?
See, everyone wants to believe
that it's obvious for someone to lose to someone more talented.
They want to lower their expectations
to protect their pride, self-respect, and similar sorts of things.
But Soma doesn't have that defense mechanism.
He has the strength to face his inadequacies head-on.
That's an incredible strength that even I don't have.
Soma-kun's cooking inspirations
aren't from natural genius or anything like that.
He just thinks things through.
He keeps testing and retesting his recipes.
Everyone can do that, but not everyone actually does.
I bet it won't work.
He's up against Hayama Akira, who has a superhuman sense of smell.
Kurokiba Ryo is an elite who was handpicked by the Nakiri family, too.
A way to win against them?
I wouldn't even bother thinking one up.
It's impossible.
Of course the genius will win.
Why did they want to think less of Soma-kun?
Because if they acknowledged him,
it'd mean acknowledging their own lack of effort.
But the tide's about to turn.
He's amazing!
Yeah.
He's playing at their level against those two monsters!
He might be able to do this.
Yeah, I kind of have to respect him now.
Yukihira...
Yukihira.
Yukihira!
Yukihira.
Yukihira Soma is...
Glad you liked it!
With this, we conclude the evaluation!
We'll now enter the final assessment!
Oh, c'mon.
Well? What is it?
I'm sure it'll be okay!
He can do it!
He can!
Soma-kun...
Yukihira...
After closing the gap in ingredient quality,
you even managed to make a dish of that caliber.
Interesting.
You're really interesting, Yukihira.
Good or bad, this is the final result.
This is it!
First, well done.
You presented each of your unique strengths well
in a clash befitting the finals!
First, regarding your cooking techniques,
all three of you are on par.
Next, regarding your ability to judge ingredient quality,
Kurokiba and Hayama are clearly exceptional.
They made the perfect choices when selecting their Pacific saury.
However, Yukihira has closed the gap through his creativity.
His inventiveness is exceptional among the three!
Great!
Even more surprisingly,
all three dishes had flavors that were nearly equal.
However, the deciding factor
was to what degree the dish was a reflection of the chef as an individual.
The chef as an individual?
That's right, Yukihira-kun.
A dish brimming with true originality
allows you to picture the chef in your mind just by tasting the dish.
Put differently,
it's a dish with such originality
that only that specific chef could've created it.
We call such a dish the chef's specialty, as a sign of respect.
The one who deserves victory
is the chef who best pursued his own cooking!
The chef who truly sought what his cooking should look like!
And that person's name is...
8 Years Ago
I don't know what my parents look like, or my real name.
All I know
is that I was abandoned as a newborn in the outskirts of the slum.
You deserve better than this.
Your sense of smell may remake the world itself!
It was Shiomi Jun who pulled me out of the slums.
Professor Hayama, who was Jun's advisor at the time,
agreed to become my legal guardian.
Raising a Child for the First Time
They chose my name to indicate someone who would bring
a new world of cooking to light.
Hayama Akira
I was named Akira.
Jun was always by my side.
Akira-kun is a very good boy.
He's so earnest in helping with my research.
He helps compensate for what I lack.
I can't thank him enough, really.
But...
I'm scared.
I'm scared that I'm making
Akira-kun do something he doesn't really want to do for my own sake.
No.
That's not true, Jun.
You saw something in me... My true worth.
You deserve better than this.
You gave me a reason to live!
You're the one who brought me into the light.
I have to win for Jun.
This isn't good enough!
My cooking's meaningless unless I can win using a method
that no one else can copy.
I will change the world of taste through the power of fragrance.
That's my cooking.
I'll give everything I have to offer to this one dish!

Hayama Akira
Hayama!
It's Hayama!
Seared Pacific Saury Carpaccio.
The dish was worthy of being called a specialty.
Congratulations, Hayama-kun!
Congratulations...
Congratu...
You did it, Hayama-kun!
I'm so happy for you! So happy...
Ugh, you always keep your cool.
You should act a little happy!
For winnin
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?!
Akira-kun, wh-what's wrong?
N-Nothing!
Akira-kun, the smell of cinnamon is said to cheer you up.
I see...
His expression during the semi-finals...
I'm the one who'll climb to the top!
I won't let anyone else get close!
That wasn't a smile of confidence.
It was to rouse himself.
It was almost as though he was threatening himself.
How fragile.
What?
Hayama-kun, that was a wonderful dish.
Thank you, Chef Dojima.
But too great a talent
will turn against itself in the end.
I hope that you will be able to maintain a good relationship with your talent.
Ryo-kun!
Jeez! Jeez, jeez, jeez, jeez, jeez!
I can't believe you lost right in front of me!
Jeez, jeez, jeez, jeez, jeez!
Hey, that hurts.
What's that for, bitch?!
Oh?!
How dare you call your master a bitch?
We're through!
You can apologize to me once you feel sorry!
I'm gonna become a chef who can beat you.
Hm?
Hey, Soma.
That sardine is no good.
Huh?
Don't lose to anyone else before you lose to me next time.
Hayama.
Can you still make that carpaccio?
I have the ingredients, I guess.
Let me have a taste.
Huh?
Why?
Let me have some.
Uh, but it takes some work
Let me try it too, bastard!
Why're you acting like you're trying to start a fight?
What's with you two?
I would've been able to make it better.
Huh? A poor loser, huh.
Listen.
Tonight decided the first-years' preliminary rankings.
Among us here, I'm the top seat.
You should show me respect from now on.
Want to have a rematch right now?!
Sure.
The results still won't change.
Now, now.
Hayama, you made a pretty good dish.
Why're you talking down to me, third place?
You don't know that!
Don't make things up!
You're saying I ranked below you?!
Don't yell while eating!
But yours was good too, Hayama.
Maybe there's nothing to worry about with Hayama.
Those three look to become an interesting trio.
Right.
The diamonds in the rough will polish each other by crashing into each other.
That is the basic principle of Totsuki.
Indeed. Tonight, yet another new genius was born!
Tch.
The 43rd Autumn Elections (92nd Class)
Victor
Hayama Akira
Soma-kun, that was really good work!
Okay, tonight, we celebrate Yukihira finishing second!
Let's party!
Yeah, in Marui's room!
Why is it always my room?
Because it's big, okay?
Crap!
Sorry, can you guys go ahead?
What do you want, Dad?
Hey, Soma.
Been a while.
Well?
How'd the main tournament go?
Oh, well...
So...
Aw! You lost, huh?!
Who won?
Hayama.
Oh, Shiomi's disciple, huh.
Get it together, yeah?
It's like I lost to Shiomi.
Shit.
He's so upbeat when he's making fun of me.
What kind of parent feels happy
when their son loses?
Well, but to be fair,
if you can perfect fragrance, it's amazing.
No, that wasn't all there was to it.
In his dish...
Dad, I'm glad I left Yukihira.
If I hadn't, I wouldn't have noticed all these things.
So, I'm going to explore the kind of cooking only I can do.
If I don't do that,
there's no point in my carrying on the family business.
Huh?
Now that I've said it,
that doesn't sound that different from what I've been doing already.
Well...
Why not? Be that way.
Was that a yawn?
Bye.
He's finally met someone his age
who can blow who he is now out of the water, huh?
That's right, Soma.
Meet them.
Only through these encounters can a chef move forward.
If you face a dish on your own,
you'll only see the same self as before.
My own cooking, huh...
A Few Days Later
Hiya!
Nikumi-cchi!
Thanks for the text.
You got a shipment of good game meat?
Nice!
Looks tasty!
Here.
It's one of mine, but it looks good on you!
Oh, thanks, Megumi.
All right, let's start!
Yeah!
How nice.
Lovely girls in a kitchen together in harmony.
It doesn't look so lovely when you actually look at it, though.
By the way, where's Yukihira?
Oh, he's back there today.
So, the mellow soy milk flavor
enhances the gentle saltiness of the Pacific saury in a good way.
Still, crunchy pickled plums feel too cheap
for me to want to eat them.
But you're shoveling it in like you like it!
Seconds.
And you want another serving?
The cartoccio I made for you yesterday was better, though.
Huh?!
Then try making it again!
Let's compare!
Whatever, but why are you guys taste-testing at our place?
I made tea!
What?!
You don't have to play hostess, Jun!
And why're you offering such high-quality cookies?
They'll be fine with cheap snacks!
Hey, we can hear you.
You're a skinflint, and a nagger, too.
The specialty... a dish that shows the chef's character.
That's because you're such a pig.
What Hayama's cooking has, but mine doesn't.
Hey!
Don't cram them all into your mouth!
Hayama!
I want to compare dishes.
One Seared Pacific Saury Carpaccio, thanks.
Make that two.
Shut up. Go home.
Two on the double, yeah?
You guys!
Yukihira's crazy,
spending all that time with someone he lost to.
Yeah.
Isn't he frustrated by the results?
I'm sure Soma-kun feels more frustrated than we'll ever know.
That's why he's there all the time.
But to know who you really are,
you must step outside the world you know.
Even if that means facing the one who got the better of you.
I'm sure the same goes for the girls, too.
They're trying their best to glean something from others,
just like Soma-kun.
Damn, we can't be left behind.
Let's do a taste-testing festival!
You guys come, too!
Sure!
Let's do this!
Not my room again!
You too, Ibusaki!
You're not going to go with them, Ibusaki-kun?
Oh, maybe you want to join the girls?
You're a closet perv, I see.
Well, there's no huge rush, but...
Either way, first-years in our high school division can only relax for a short while.
Why's that?
What do you mean?
Soon, you'll be tossed outside the academy.
It's going to start.
