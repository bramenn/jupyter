Even before the qualifier, there was something between us and Sabertooth,
but Natsu had to make it worse by slugging it out with them at their inn.
They started somethin' right when we were gettin' momentum...
Jeez. You never think ahead!
By the way, it's almost the fourth day of the Grand Magic Games, right?
Wendy got a tie,
but Erza, Cana, and Laxus were awesome!
I wonder what the next competition part will be.
I've kind of got a bad feeling about this...
Cheers!
Today felt great!
Aye!
This isn't the guild, so don't break anything!
Did you see my true power out there?
That was a cheat, wasn't it?
Gray-sama, you were wonderful today, as always!
I didn't do anything...
I feel bad. Even though Erza-san had an easy victory,
I didn't win...
What are you saying?! You did a good job!
You surprised everyone.
Yeah! You were great, Wendy!
At any rate, you've got amazing recuperative strength, Erza.
That's thanks to Wendy and Poluchka-san.
Even with their power, Elfman hasn't recovered...
It's pathetic...
Dammit...
Somebody must be talkin' about me being a Man...
Why is Ever sleepin' here?! Dammit!
I'm not... worried about you...
Don't tell me...
Naval Battle!
Booze barrel surfing!
Aye, sir!
L-Look out!
Cut it out, Natsu!
What are you doin', jackass?!
You wanna do it, too?!
You're doin' it to the point of gettin' motion sick?!
Alright! I'll do it!
Do your best, Gray-sama!
What the hell is with your clothes?!
In that case...
Yeesh! It's dangerous, I said!
Somebody, stop them!
Everyone, you're getting too excited!
Lu-chan, why don't you join in?
I'm wearing a skirt, after all...
I see someone over there who wiped out wearing a skirt...
Even now, when I close my eyes, I can picture it...
Here you go, Lisanna!
Everyone reveling, singing...
Sting-kun...
Can't you sleep?
Lector...
I have a feeling that I'm going to fight Natsu-san tomorrow.
I've been waiting for that day...
I know you'll win, Sting-kun!
Both you and Kagura have been acting weird since we got back.
Did something happen?
It's not important...
Why is Jellal with Fairy Tail?
Does Er-chan know this?
If there's something weighing on your mind,
tell me what it is.
After all, we're teammates.
Thank you. But I'm fine.
It has nothing to do with the matches.
H-Hey... Hey...
Let's definitely win this thing!
I love this guild,
so I want to work even harder for everyone!
Sergeant Yukino Agria.
Please pardon my unannounced visit.
While various feelings crossed each other,
the third night of the tournament wore on.
We were heading for that day.
We had four days...
Day four of the Grand Magic Games!
In just a moment, today's competition will begin!
The name of the competition is Naval Battle!
In other words, a sea battle!
Any player who leaves the sphere of water is out!
The last person to remain in the sphere is the winner!
However, when it gets down to two people left,
a special rule will come into effect.
That's the five-minute rule!
When there are two players left, they've got five minutes!
The one person who leaves the sphere during that time will be in last place.
So it's basically a sumo match in water.
I can't wait! Thank you very much for inviting me!
Our guest today is Rabian-san, leader of the Scheherazade Theatrical Troupe.
All of the teams are entering the water.
Cheria from Lamia Scale!
I tied yesterday, but I'll try even harder today!
Jenny from Blue Pegasus!
There's no way I'll lose this time!
From Mermaid Heel, Risley!
Better not underestimate a mermaid!
Juvia from Fairy Tail B has also entered the water!
Juvia is the water.
This is Juvia's exclusive territory.
Sabertooth's Minerva has arrived.
There she is... Minerva! Listen to those cheers!
Sabertooth certainly did choose their top five strongest to compete.
Thank you very much!
And Lucy from Fairy Tail A!
I can't lose either!
I have to redeem myself after blowing it on the first day!
What a gorgeous tapestry we've got before us!
All of the players are female and they're wearing swimsuits!
Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Thank you very much!
Um...
I'm here, too... and I'm wild.
A man?
You clucked your tongue at me?!
The rules are simple. If you leave the water, you're out.
In just a moment, the Naval Battle will begin!
Go get'em, Lucy!
Since she's in water, she can use Aquarius, right?
This is a good contest for her.
Yep!
I think this match is Juvia's to lose.
I dunno...
Lucy can use plenty of other Celestial Spirits beyond Aquarius.
We probably shouldn't make light of Mermaid Heel either.
After all, they do have mermaid in their name.
That Minerva looks like a tough customer, too...
Lu-chan, do your best!
And now, let the Naval Battle begin!
Sorry, everyone, but right off the bat...
Open! Gate of the Water Bearer!
Aquarius!
A Celestial Spirit!
They've got a mermaid, too, huh? The more the merrier!
Water is my garden!
Wild!
Oh, no, you don't! Water Cyclone!
Aquarius and Juvia's attacks are colliding head on!
We've got a highlight right away!
Wow! I wonder which of them is stronger?!
Good luck, Juvia!
After her, good luck to you, too, Lucy!
And then, just a little bit of good luck to Jenny!
The way you cheer is a pain.
Well, who do you think is going to win?
It's not even worth asking.
You let Juvia into water, nobody else stands a chance.
I haven't seen you for a while, Aquarius-san.
Just because we're acquainted, don't think I'm gonna hold back.
You took the words out of my mouth.
Aquarius really is amazing, huh?
I mean, she's not even takin' a licking from Juvia's power!
But by that same argument,
I get the feeling that Juvia-san's amazing for not losing to Aquarius-san!
We're even?!
Juvia is going to win!
Juvia can't let Gray-sama see her shameful in battle!
It seems Juvia is worried about how you see her.
You must realize by now how Juvia feels about you.
Why not give her a clear-cut response?
Juvia!
My romantic rival!
You've got me all wrong!
What kind of fight is this?!
The toughest opponents are taking each other out.
In that case, while I've got the chance...
I'll start with one!
Wild!
Quatro Puppy is out!
He was sucker punched by Jenny!
But only Quatro Puppy feels bad about that!
This crowd only cares about the girls!
Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Thank you very much!
What was the point of me being in there anyway?
That woman's cheap tricks know no bounds.
That kind of fighting is Jenny all over.
You know, that wasn't a compliment...
I've gotta do my best, too!
Never underestimate the chubby!
We'll never get anywhere at this rate!
I'm going back for now!
Wha? Why?!
In water, you're the one I can count on the most!
I've got a date!
Hey!
Oh, my!
The Celestial Spirit, Aquarius, left to go on a date!
She is a girl...
Boring...
You're wide open!
This is my chance to take out my romantic rival!
Virgo! Aries!
I'm sorry this is so fluffy!
I'm your sexy guard, Princess!
That was close...
Thank you very much!
No matter how many you bring out, the result is the same!
Virgo, Aries, do your best!
I'm better on land than in the water...
I've gotta do my best to impress, too!
Then give me your best shot!
Don't forget about me either!
Cheria!
Fairy Tail's Wendy-tan!
It looks like she wants to get in on the action, too!
Well, her match did end in a draw yesterday.
She's as good as saying, This time for sure, I want to beat Cheria with my own hands!
I'm not thinking that at all!
I wanted to see Wendy-tan fight...
Thank you very much for helping my troupe last time!
Fairy Tail A!
Why didn't you let Wendy-tan do this one?!
It's not too late! Switch her in!
Thank you very much.
Shut up!
Juiva is going to knock you all out at once!
Nobody can win against Juvia in the water!
Juvia learned this move when Second Origin was released...
This new special technique!
Go forth, wings of love!
Gray-sama, love!
Knock it off!
Fluffy guard at full throttle!
Princess, hang on!
Would you believe it?! Juvia has knocked out three at once!
In a water battle, Juvia is unbeatable!
I wasn't able to muster as much power as I thought in the water...
You gave it your all, Cheria!
Did you feel something while watching Juvia, Gray-sama?
He's totally turned off!
Juvia!
She was outstanding, but unfortunately, she's out!
But even so, for third place,
her team gets six points!
That idiot...
She went out of the sphere.
Why? Was she not paying attention?
Our lady is a mischievous one.
With her magic, she should've been able to get them all out of the sphere in an instant.
She's already won this.
Only Minerva and Lucy are left.
Lucy's Celestial Spirits have gone home for now.
To avoid depleting her magic and physical strength, most likely.
Alright! Who's gonna win this, Sabertooth or Fairy Tail?!
The five-minute rule comes into play now!
The person who leaves the sphere in the next five minutes will be in last place!
I wonder what this rule is for...
It's to keep the tension high to the very end.
Thank you very much.
With my magic, I could have you outside of here in a flash,
but that would spoil the fun.
Try to withstand this, Fairy Tail.
What is that?!
Heat?
In the water?!
Lucy!
What the hell kind of magic is that?!
Th-That time it was heavy...
Felt like lead...
If I don't get a Celestial Spirit out here...
Huh? Where are my keys?!
When did she...?!
If Lucy exits the sphere now, she'll be in last place!
Oh?
It's hot again!
Feels like I'll get burned!
Lucy!
She can't use any magic with her keys stolen!
No matter what...
Maybe it's about time for me to put you outside?
If I lose now...
I can't betray everyone's feelings!
That's why...
W-What's going on here?!
Minerva's attacks have stopped!
And just like that...
Yes!
All that's left is ranking them!
Lucy!
You're arrogant, Fairy Tail!
What do you know of us?!
We are this world's number one guild!
We're Sabertooth!
This time for sure she's going out...
She vanished?!
Lucy was going to be knocked out of the sphere...
Is it that woman's magic?!
Why would she bother bringing her back?
Does she intend to rough Lucy up?!
The match is already over!
And now a body blow!
Even without using magic, Minerva has incredible power!
Please stop. Now you're just being cruel.
Thank you very much!
She's still in the water, so she's not down!
She's just taking a beating!
Stop!!
Sabertooth!
Do you know what it means to dis Sabertooth?
I'm going to teach you with her body!
Stop this! She'll destroy the Celestial Spirit wizard!
Stop the competition!
The referee has stopped it!
The competition is over!
The winner is Minerva!
Sabertooth really is strong!
Lucy hasn't moved for a while, but is she okay?!
Lucy!
Lucy!!
At last!
The identity of that weird rabbit is...
That person?!
Hey, Natsu, when is it you say the words I feel sick?
Where's that question coming from?
Anyway, I guess I say it when I have motion sickness.
What other situation?
Like when I eat too much?
Next time: The Perfume I Dedicate to You!
You don't use it with people?
Uh-uh.
I see... Then I've got a feeling I can't put into words...
