So this is Tsutsugami Gais
Youve belonged to this side since the beginning.
What made you think that you could cuddle up to some human?
You monster.
Somethings not quite right
The reality of the destruction around us fills our mind
The raging rain sounds like a storm of tears
that your eyes were given to you to acknowledge others,
that your eyes were given to you to acknowledge others,
that your eyes were given to you to acknowledge others,
that your eyes were given to you to acknowledge others,
that your eyes were given to you to acknowledge others,
that your voice was given to you to tell others how you feel
All living things
bear witness to my song
Your heart contains all its truth
Even when all you see in your path are storms
remember that your strength is no coincidence
Im sorry, Mana.
What?! She should be here!
Manas not here.
She never has been.
You never change, Haruka.
Youre honest with yourself, and youre an idealist who never gives up.
Just like him like Ouma Kurosu.
Youre the one who killed him, werent you
So you knew.
Why? You were best friends!
Best friends”? Me and him?
Come on, hands in the air.
What is it? What do you think Ive done?
Please dont move.
You
Is this revenge for betraying you?
I dont care about what happens to me.
Tell me where Inori is, please.
Her?!
Attention all units.
Dr. Ouma Haruka has committed high treason and is now on the run.
Anyone who finds her is to arrest her on sight.
Dr. Ouma Haruka has committed high treason and is now on the run.
Anyone who finds her is to arrest her on sight.
Thats one of the cases Sephirah uses to transport top secret
Whats so funny?
Its all clear!
Im afraid that its all clear to me now!
Mr. President, about Dr. Ouma
I would love to be the one you send to track her.
Where are you going, Comrade Arisa?
Im going after Dr. Ouma. Ill tell Gai myself.
W-Wait! You didnt say Master”...!
Let me speak with Ouma Haruka once we find her.
Understood?
Is that your condition for telling me where Inori is?
Im sure she knows what Gais plan is.
I want to know him.
His past, his desires, his weaknesses, his pains
Everything.
The Kuhouins I have nowhere else to go now.
Dr. Ouma Haruka, am I right?
Its been a long time, Haruka.
Kurachi!?
When I heard you were on the run, I thought you might come here.
I have slight problem.
However Im afraid that this is no longer the Kuhouin mansion.
Then Mr. Kuhouin?
It was a heros death.
I tried to kill Mana to prevent Daath from carrying out its plan.
But I failed.
Wait moment. I thought Mana was
My daughter.
In other words, Shus older sister?
You know Shu?
Im a member of the Undertakers.
I see. The Undertakers
What was Shu like?
Im his mother, but I neglected him
No, thats not it.
Ive just been running away from him, havent I?
Haruka isnt my real mother.
She got remarried to my father, but he died shortly after.
She raised me anyway, though.
It wasnt out of a sense of duty or anything.
I really did care about Shu.
Shu lost a parent, and I lost him
Still, the two of us were
Yes, perhaps we were only licking each others wounds.
Then you can assure me that this building is a hideout of the Undertakers?
Y-Yes
I cant hear you!
I-Im not lying! Please believe me!
Im picking up a signal, Sir. Its the real thing.
Magnificent. Youre an honest woman.
This is just a small token of my thanks.
Someones here.
Excuse me, we heard that there was vaccine here
How much would you charge for some?
We heard that the government stockpiles are running out
I have two young children at home! Please!
You want to keep it all to yourself, dont you? Despicable!
Yeah, hes right!
Come out and face us!
Open the door!
We said wed pay you!
Youre mistaken. Theres no vaccine here.
Liar!
You cant fool us.
Show us you really dont have any!
All right. Ill open the door, so come and see for yourselves.
See? Its just an office.
Theres no vaccine anywhere.
Being a champion of justice just doesn't pay.
Ogumo!
Dont worry about me! Just run!
You too.
You bastard!
Too bad.
We seem to be short two
Shouldnt we go back?
Its dangerous for us to go.
Lets try asking a different team.
What is this?
The last hope.
Dont tell me its...!?
A Void Genome.
Our last and worst hope.
Theres no way we can take on Gai!
What, this doesnt piss you off at all?
But even Ogumo got taken down
Weve only lost contact with him.
Argos out checking on him right now.
How is he?
Getting worse little by little.
Cant we do anything about it?
Im sorry. Our vaccine can't treat those that hit Stage III.
Argos back!
What about Ogumo?
Hes not with you?
Yes he is.
But
Hes with me.
No way
Im sorry. He was protecting me.
No
Ogumo
How far youve fallen, Gai.
Five years ago
In the hell of the African battlefront,
I saw a natural talent in the child soldier who tried to kill me.
Ive worked to make you king ever since.
However Is this what you wanted, Tsutsugami Gai?
To become the unsightly idol you are now?
Ive only ever had one goal, then and now.
You people chose to build dreams on it
and then chose to be disappointed, thats all.
All right, what were the Undertakers to you, then?
What did we fight for?
Do you want to know?
And yet, believe it or not, I thought of you as a friend.
A king has no friends.
He only has subordinates. Pawns.
Then as one of your pawns, I suppose I should express my gratitude.
To kill you.
Here.
Thank you.
If I used that, would I be able to fight Gai?
At the very least, you'd gain the same power he has.
But...
It's also possible that every gene in your body could have an extreme rejection reaction.
I'm a horrible person.
I don't want to let Shu use it,
but I do want to have someone use it.
I can understand that a little.
Because I've seen Shu suffer because of his power, too.
It's not just that.
If he used it again, he'd probably die.
That's how dangerous it is.
Let's pull out all the stops.
Today is a party!
It looks like we're too late.
Hold it right there, Ouma Shu!
Haruka!
Leave me behind...
Just shut up.
I don't want to abandon anyone anymore.
Yahiro...
No need to hold back!
Make the bullets pour down like rain!
Lay waste to them like a storm!
It's no use
I can't contact anyone.
We'll have to go back.
But if we go back, we'll be caught in a pincer attack.
Then what do you suggest?!
Sorry.
Dr. Ouma, please use the Void Genome on me.
Shu once gave me the courage and power to stand up and fight.
So this time, I want to stand up on my own.
Even if it means a confrontation with Gai!
Ayase, where's this coming from?!
It's okay. I've been thinking about this for a while.
Please!
I wont let you!
Three ampules were produced.
I've been searching for the remaining one for quite some time.
I shouldve known that you had it, Dr. Ouma.
I'll be taking it now.
To do what?
I want to behold it, that mystical and sublime light.
I'm quite sure the truth lies beyond that light.
Yes, I dare say I would do anything to have it.
Talk until youre blue in the face!
You little tomboy!
I won't let you have it!
Shu!
Give it back, Shu.
Do you understand what that is?!
Of course I do, Ayase.
Everything started with this.
I should be the one who bears the burden of this sin.
No! That's our sin!
There won't be a second time, Shu!
The Void power will kill you!
Thanks, Mom.
Even if we're not really mother and son,
I'm glad I got to be with you.
I really feel that way.
But you see...
This is the one thing I can do.
Shu!
Don't!
Yes, this is it! This, this!
No, Shu!
I should have known it would be you.
I've been running away all this time.
But right here, right now, I'm going to reveal myself!
His right hand!
Shu...
A royal gun salute to mark the king's birth!
I'm sorry, Ayase.
Shu...
No need to hold back! Fire every bullet you've got!
Shu...
I know this is selfish and inconsiderate,
but would you let me rely on your powers one last time?
Shu, you...
Ouma Shu!
How about this?
Do you have it in you to kill me?
I've decided.
I'll get my hands as dirty as I have to, for their sake.
It's inside me...
Inside me
Another person's heart...
Shu!
Shu!
Look!
Shu's body!
The cancer?
But it wasn't there a second ago!
It's mine.
That's my cancer.
Then Shu's Void is...?
His Void gathers everything and assumes its weight.
Strengths, weaknesses, light, darkness...
Everything.
Shu... Are you telling me that's your destiny?
Are you telling me that's your will too, Kurosu?
If the Apocalypse virus turns misery into bad will,
I'll assume that bad will, too.
The bad will can sink into my body.
I'm coming, Inori.
