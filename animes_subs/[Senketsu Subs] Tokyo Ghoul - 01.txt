CCG Base to 203,
trespassers reported in the 20th Ward at the Aqua Building.
Trespassers are believed to be ghouls- repeat, ghouls.
Proceed to location immediately.
Ah...
More! More!
Delicious!
It looks like they weren't kidding when they called you a binge eater.
I hate being interrupted when I'm eating.
You don't know me, do you?
Yes, I do. You're a joyless fellow that enjoys bothering others.
I've got orders from above.
I'm supposed to take you alive.
But then, before I do, I can take a finger or two,
an arm or two, a leg or two...
You don't mind, do you?
A small toy for such a big body. I'll bet you like playing house.
How adorable.
Let me...
take them from you.
Give them back. They're mine.
Give them back!
I'm not going to play with you.
Early this morning, several unidentified male bodies
were discovered in the Aqua Building,
a commercial facility in Tokyo's 20th Ward.
What is believed to be saliva belonging to ghouls
was retrieved from the bodies,

and the incident is being investigated as a ghoul crime.
It's not that funny, is it?
I'm just saying, you can't have a first date at a bookstore, right?
Why not? She might be thrilled, you know!
I'll state for the record, that won't happen. Case dismissed.
Huh? Then first, I'll take her out to Big Girl, just the two of us,
and we'll get a burger.
I'm giving you a serious answer.
No, it's great! It's great, just like you!
But as a date, it'll be a flop.
What, is everything I do wrong? Hide, what would you do?
Anteiku
What, is everything I do wrong? Hide, what would you do?
Anteiku
Listen up. You have to choose a place
Anteiku
where the girl will be pleased when making a date.
Anteiku
Such as?
Anteiku
Huh? S-Such as...
Anteiku
Hide, you don't even know.
Hide, you don't even know.
If I knew,
-I wouldn't be here spending my afternoon off like this -These last few days have seen a string
-out having a date with you. -of predatory ghoul attacks in the 20th Ward,
-I guess that's true. -of predatory ghoul attacks in the 20th Ward,
Being Investigated as Ghoul Predation
and according to CCG's 20th Ward Branch,
Being Investigated as Ghoul Predation
they are investigating the possibility that the incidents
they are investigating the possibility that the incidents
-That's pretty close, huh? -are the result of the same culprit. In other news...
So? So, so, so?
Who is she? The cute girl you mentioned?
-Oh, that's her, right? -Yes, indeed. -No it isn't.
Sure, she's cute, too...
Excuse me!
One cappuccino, please! And you, Kaneki?
-I'm not done with this, yet. -One cappuccino.
And also, what's your name?
Hide!
It's Kirishima Toka.
Miss Toka! Are you seeing anyone?!
Stop that, you idiot!
Hmm, how lovely.
If I get kicked out of here, then what do I do?!
This shop is the one place where she and I both-
She's... the one.
Give it up.
Huh?
You and her would be Beauty and whatever.
The Beast!
Well then... Now that I've seen you lovelorn,
Egg of the Black Goat
Well then... Now that I've seen you lovelorn,
Egg of the Black Goat
I think I'll be off.
Wait, Hide...
See you later, Miss Toka.
Good luck, delusional Kaneki!
Egg of the Black Goat
I guess sometimes you get lucky.
Yeah. Imagine, liking the same novelist that I do!
Yeah, who was it again? Takasaki Sen?
No, Takatsuki Sen!
We're going to go to the bookstore together this coming Sunday.
Oh, yeah? I'm not sure how good a bookstore date is gonna be,
but have a good time.
Yeah.
I have to say, this is getting ugly.
Yeah.
Word is that eating one person is supposed to last them a month,
but these binge eaters are something else.
Write them off as animals,
and they'd eat any number of people, wouldn't they?
Ghouls as animals, huh?
They're worse than livestock, since they're not good for anything.
That's true.
Mr. Kaneki, what's your favorite work by Takatsuki?
It would have to be his debut book.
It was a breakout hit, after all.
The delicacy amidst all the extremeness, you might say.
Y-Yes, exactly. To have that much talent in writing,
and still be in his teens when it came out-
Are you all right?
I-I'm fine...
Er, I mean... that is...
Miss Rize, you don't eat much, do you?
Huh? Oh... Actually, um, I'm on a dietary regimen...
Excuse me, I need the restroom.
She's a girl...
Thank you very much for today.
No, thank you. It-It's been fun.
The truth is, I... live near where these recent incidents have been...
Oh, the ghouls?
I'm awfully bad at handling this.
Just thinking about it even now, I can't stop from trembling.
That's all right.
Please, rest assured. I'll see you home.
Yes, so then Hide asked me, Which do you like better, me or novels?
He sounds like a funny person.
Yes.
Was there something that served to turn you on to books?
My dad left us a lot of books in our house.
Ah...
I lost my dad before I can even remember. I liked the books he left,
and while my mom was out working, I spent the time reading them.
Then, ever since my mom died...
You know, Hide is the only one I've ever told this to.
Is that right? Ah...
It's this way.
Oh, okay.
Toka, is something wrong?
Mm-mm, not really.
Well, I'm right over here, so...
Miss Rize...
Um, if you wouldn't mind, can I see you again?
We do have a similar taste in books, and we're the same age...
There's a lot we have in common, huh?
Mr. Kaneki...
Y- Yes?
The truth is, I noticed you.
The way you were looking at me.
Huh? Then, you mean, you, too...
Yes.
I, too...
happen to be interested...
in you.
Ah, delicious!
Mr. Kaneki,
there's something I like even more than reading. Know what it is?
It's pulling out all the organs of someone
who isn't trying to run away from me.
That expression! It's fantastic!
Would you let me...
thrill myself even more?!
No way! No way! No way! No way! No way! No way! No way!
I caught you!
Mr. Kaneki!
I'm going to gently scramble up your insides for you now, okay?
Uh-oh, did you die?
That's too bad. I really did like you.
There's just the right amount of fat on you;
you look nice and soft, and easy to eat.
How...
could... this...
His abdominal organs are ruptured.
-What is this? -We'll begin operating immediately.
Where is this place?
I thought I was on a date with Miss Rize...
Prepare for organ transplant.
Without the consent of the next of kin?
Organ? Next of kin?
What exactly are they talking about?
Dr. Kano!
I will accept full responsibility!
Transfer her organs into him!
It's warm...
Is this...?
That's strange. What's going on here?
Mr. Kaneki!
Is this all you're going to eat?
Oh, right. Your friend came by again today.
Ah, Dr. Kano...
How are we feeling, Kaneki?
I hear you haven't eaten anything since you were admitted,
but there doesn't particularly seem to be anything wrong.
Um...
my sense of taste... isn't right...
Sense of taste?
It's like everything tastes icky...
That could be psychological in nature.
It was a pretty serious accident, after all.
There's no rush.
Take all the time you need to heal.
I'll be by again later.
Nothing particularly wrong?
It almost seems like the events of that whole day with Miss Rize
were something that never really happened.
But one thing is for sure...
Ever since then, something has been...
something has been strange.
Kaneki!
Congratulations on your discharge!
Presenting some leftover high-quality ingredients from my place,
along with your favorite hamburger.
I hope you appreciate it! Wah-ha-ha!
It's rough here on my own.
Hide...
Thanks.
But I'm sorry.
A ghoul doesn't have any need to eat this much
in this short amount of time in the first place.
One dead body will allow them to survive for a month or two.

Mr. Ogura, can't ghouls be satisfied
by eating the same food as humans do?
No, ghouls are only able to derive their nutrition from people.
Not to mention that their tongues work differently than ours do.

Not to mention that their tongues work differently than ours do.

When they eat human food,
it tastes incredibly awful to them.
Their tongues work differently than ours do...
It tastes incredibly awful to them...
Oh, no...
Oh, no...
Presenting your favorite hamburger.
Hide...
Did you go out and buy this just for me?
This can't be real.
Hide
Friend of yours?
Yes.
He was supposed to get out of the hospital today,
but I can't reach him. I went to see him several times, too,
but I got turned away.
Hmm... If it were me I'd cut off ties with anyone as rude as that.
Kaneki and I have been best friends since we were kids.
Best friends, huh?
Hello? Kaneki? How are you feeling? I was just at the bookstore
in front of the station, and Akatsuki what's-his-name
is doing a book signing, so I thought I'd tell you.
Anyhow, give me a call when you're feeling better.
The Akatsuki Sen book signing is now over.

Flesh!
Whoa, that man...
Don't get involved, you dummy!
What is this?
I know what's causing it!
Transfer her organs into him!
Blades such as knives or kitchenware cannot hurt them.
If that's true...
If that's true... If that's true...
then this...!
What am I supposed to do now?
Kill a person... take their flesh!
What... am I...? It's almost as though I'm...
That scent...
It's the first time I'm smelling it, but it seems so familiar...
A sweet aroma, like Mom's home cooking...
There's something over here that even I can eat!
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?!
It's close...
A ghoul...
A human!
How could I have been enticed here by the scent of a corpse?!
You're a ghoul... right?
What's the matter? Are you all right?
My name's Kazuo. It's been a long time for me,
so I can't share too much with you,
but here, eat-
Sheesh,
don't go plundering my feeding grounds. Hmm?
I've never seen you before.
For that matter, why is only one of your eyes red? That's nasty.
You know what you get for looting someone else's territory, right?
I-I wasn't... I didn't know...
I just happened to be passing by...
Okay, imagine this. Your girlfriend is naked and lying on the ground.
Then someone else there with his pants down says to you,
I wasn't doing anything. I just happened to be here.
That's the same as what you're telling me.
If it were me, I'd kill the guy.
That's why I'm killing you,
as punishment for trespassing on my feeding grounds-
Whose feeding grounds, did you say?
Since when were these your feeding grounds,
Nishiki?
Toka...
I know she's dead, right? The binge eating woman?
And that makes these your feeding grounds?
The task of distributing the feeding grounds Rize stole
to the weaker ghouls, and otherwise managing the 20th Ward...
belongs to those of us at Anteiku.
Huh?! A bunch of fence-sitters like Anteiku
have no right to go picking over every little thing!
This was my feeding ground in the first place, before Rize came-
Because you were weak.
Being insulted by a smart-mouthed punk younger than I am
is something that really pisses me off.
Is it?
Enough!
You'll have to cut deeper than that!
Will I?
Can I go even harder next time?
Take your corpse with you, beansprout.
You want this?
You're not eating?
Then again, only one of your eyes is different...
You're the one who was with Rize.
Why weren't you eaten? Then again...
your eye...
Please help me...!
I know you may not believe this, but I'm human. And yet...
I want to eat that...
I want to eat it so bad I can't help it...
But if I do...
I won't be human anymore!
If you're in that much pain, then eat.
No way!
No way! No way! No way! No way! No way! No way!
There's no way I can eat something like that, right?
What is this? What is it to be a ghoul?
Killing people... killing each other...
I'm not like that!
I'm... human!
I'm... human!
This is ridiculous. Why not give in already?
If you don't have the nerve to eat...
then I'll give you a hand!
