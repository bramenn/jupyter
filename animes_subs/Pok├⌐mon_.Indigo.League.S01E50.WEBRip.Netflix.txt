-Okay, Togepi. Open wide. -
-Now, make sure to chew every bite. -
-These rice balls are pretty good. -Cha!
Ha, ha. Of course they are.
Argh!
When you got lemons, you make lemonade
and when youve got rice, you make rice balls.
Eat up, everybody. Theres plenty more where that came from.
As our heroes enjoy a delicious meal,
they are completely unaware they are being closely watched by a mysterious stranger.
What could he possibly be plotting?
Okay, I have the Pikachu in my sights.
Now, dont move.
-Look out, everyone! -Argh!
-Run for cover! -Whats go... Oh!
-Whats your problem? -Pika-pi! Pikachu!
-Oh, its okay. Im right here for you. -
Are you crazy, Ash? You just made Togepi cry.
Oh, well, I thought someone there was trying to shoot us.
-Where? -There.
Theres nobody here.
- -Oh, its okay. Its okay.
There was somebody there.
You were probably just seeing things.
If you dont believe me, see for yourself. Squirtle! I choose you!
Squirtle!
Fire Water Gun at 1:00, now.
-Quit it. Stop spraying me. -
Squirtle, return.
-Is everything okay? -Uh.
Its okay. Its working just fine.
I wasnt asking about your camera. I was worried about you.
But, you see, this camera is my life.
Get yourself a new life. Why were you spying on us?
I wasnt spying on you.
My names Todd and I love taking pictures.
You didnt have to sic your Squirtle on me and flip out like that.
Come on.
You should consider it an honor that I want to take a picture of your Pikachu.
-Pika? -Oh, really?
If you wanted to take a picture, why didnt you just ask us first?
I didnt want Pikachu to know I was taking pictures of it.
I never like them to look posed.
You see, I am the number one Pokemon photo master!
Did he say...
-Masker? -Thats right. Im the...
-Oh, not masker. I said master. -Uh-huh.
Pika.
You may not recognize my name
but Im sure you heard of the photographer
who took the only known photo of the legendary Pokemon Aerodactyl.
-Uh... -Have you?
-Uh, not me. -
How is it possible that they never heard of me?
Pika, pika.
Here! Look at this issue of Pokemon Times.
-Thats my picture of an Aerodactyl. -Theres his name.
Hey, yeah. I guess you are famous.
Wah! Hey! Thats me!
What are you talking about?
This is Aerodactyl, the ancient Pokemon.
Right, but see here? This is me.
- -Argh!
See? I told you. Thats me getting carried away by that Aerodactyl.
I guess youre right. That puny little thing really is you.
Puny?
Hmm, its incredible how two people can be brought together by a single photograph.
Its funny when you think about it.
Youre in the picture and nobody knows who you are
and I take your picture, and Im world famous.
Yeah, thats real hysterical.
Uh, Im sorry I scared you.
Let me make some breakfast for you. You like pancakes?
-Uh, pancakes? -Thats right.
-You bet. I love pancakes. -I havent had pancakes in a long time.
-That sounds great, Todd. -Okay.
And Im sure you wont mind if I take Pikachus picture.
-Uh... -Pika?
Dont worry. Ill be sure to capture your best side.
Pi?
-Lets chow down. -Pika Pikachu!
Mmm! You have to give me your recipe.
- These are delicious. -Pika, pika.
Pika, pika?
Okay, Pikachu, uh, keep eating.
Just pretend Im not in the room, all right? Relax. Just act natural.
Thats fabulous.
Now smile. Smile!
-This is going to be great! -Pika?
-Pi! Pikachu! -
The cameras shutter must have scared Pikachu.
-We dont get our picture taken too much. -Pika.
Theres nothing to be afraid of, Pikachu. Lets try again.
-Okay, smile. -
Pika?
Im sorry. I cant work like this.
What do you mean, Todd?
Pokemon should be photographed naturally, not posing.
Thats the only way I want my pictures of Pokemon.
Why is it such a big deal whether the Pokemon pose or dont pose?
Take a look at those photographs over there.
Theyre all Pokemon living in their own natural habitats.
Those arent poses. Look how peaceful they are.
Dont those shots show Pokemon the way they ought to be?
Wow. Ive never seen Pokemon pictures like that before.
-They all look so cute and carefree. -Yeah, theyre happy.
With my pictures, I can show the whole world
how happy and beautiful Pokemon are in the wild.
-Yeah. -Thats great.
You have a real talent for showing Pokemon the way they should be seen.
Thats why I never want to shoot a Pokemon thats posed.
-And looks sad and scared. -Pika.
Well, Pikachu may not like being photographed,
but Pikachu is not my only Pokemon, you know?
Ive got others in these Poke Balls.
How about a shot of Pidgeotto?
Pidgeo!
-Or Bulbasaur? -Bulbasaur!
I have Pokemon you can shoot too.
Hey, how about taking some shots of my Pokemon?
See, Todd? I have plenty of Pokemon you can take great pictures of.
-Me too. -Dont forget me!
Uh, thats very nice, but no thanks.
Whats the matter, Todd? Is there something wrong with our Pokemon?
No, theyre fine, but I only want to take pictures of Pikachu.
Whats so important about taking Pikachu's picture?
-Well, you see... -No, we dont see. Tell us.
I cant tell you why.
What do you mean, I cant tell you why?
Thats all I can say.
I have to take Pikachu and thats all there is to it!
Mm. Then go ahead.
But you wont have much luck.
Ha, ha. You just watch. Ill capture you, Pikachu,
like no other photographer could capture you.
Pi, pika.
You must help us. We really need you to capture this Pikachu.
Oh, please. This Pikachu is so important to us.
Pikachu?
Hmm, these pictures rot.
Please. Grant this old woman one last wish before she passes on.
Its so sad. They must have raised a Pikachu just like this one.
Ill do it. Ill use my camera to capture Pikachu on film for them.
-Dont worry! Ill take the job! -You mean youll do it?
Ill capture the Pikachu perfectly.
Thank goodness we found you before it was too late.
Were very grateful.
But wed appreciate it if youd not tell anyone that weve been here.
No problem! I would never reveal my clients identities.
I have to grant the old womans wish.
I have to capture the perfect picture of Pikachu.
Um, all right, Meowth, where did you find this Todd kid?
Can he... get Pikachu?
It says in the Pokemon Times
that this kids the best at capturing Pokemon.
And he did show us that huge photo album with all the Pokemon he said hed taken.
He even said he wanted to take a shot at Pikachu or something like that.
- Let me have it! - I need protein! Uh!
Youre not acting like a nice old lady.
Ha, thats because Im not nice or old.
Ah, time to lose this guys disguise.
Surprise! Surprise!
Yeah, right.
-Pika Pikachu! -
- Hold it right there! -Pika!
- Hey, what? -
-You got to be quicker. -Chu!
Ready? Ah, not again.
-Wah! Missed again, Todd! -Chu!
Argh, Ill get that picture if its the last thing I do.
Remember the last time we made a trap like this, Meowth?
Yeah, I really dug it.
Why dont you try more digging and less talking?
Those twerps are on their way and they will be here any minute... Ooh!
Uh, I think I just discovered something.
What are you stopping for? Keep digging.
Roger!
Patty-cake, patty-cake, its a trap.
Huh? Its that Todd kid! Hurry up! Disguises on!
Huh?
Look at yourselves. You got them mixed up!
Huh?
Im sorry. I havent taken that Pikachu for you yet.
Were sure youll get it sooner or later.
And just as a little insurance policy, we even dug this trap-
Hmm. This dirt is soft.
May be a good place to wait for Pikachu.
All right. Tripod, check.
Camera, check. Lens, check.
Okay, now Im ready.
Right on time.
Pika. Pi, pi.
Pikachu must really hate cameras.
Ive never seen it act so nervous before.
Oh, its too bad Todd wont get the kind of picture hes so great at.
I dont see whats so great about that Todd.
He doesnt even understand the feelings of the Pokemon he takes pictures of.
I dont understand the Pokemon's feelings?
-I say we just forget about Todd... - Argh!
-Theyre gone! -Ow! My arm!
Whose idea was it to put a hole in the road?
Who else would have an idea like that?
Just Team Rocket.
-We finally caught them. -They fell for our trap.
Usually were the ones to fall in.
Oh, I cant wait. Soon well have our Pikachu.
Lets watch and learn from the expert.
Its capture time!
-How did you get down there? -Easy. We fell.
-Youve got to get us out of here. -Uh, I think I have a rope.
Pi...
-Are you okay, Pikachu? -Pikachu!
Huh? Ah, thats the Pikachu I want to capture.
-Great. Now throw us that rope, Todd. -What is that boy doing?
Hes taking a picture of Pikachu.
-Meowth! -Huh?
The magazine says hes, uh... Aw.
The best at capturing Pokemon on film.
Ah, now I get it.
The article said that hes good at capturing them on film.
I thought he actually captures them. An amusing mistake.
Youre the mistake!
Ah! Meowth!
All right, hold it.
I did it! Okay, now, just a few more. Huh?
-Oh, no. Grab the rope! -Huh?
The bottom of the pit is crumbling.
Youve got to get out before it falls through.
Huh?
-Ash! Oh! -Pikachu! Huh?
Pikachu, dont let go.
-Pika! - Ash, Pikachu!
-Are you okay? -Yeah, were okay.
Grab on to something quick. Theres not much time.
Huh? Uh...
Ah! Theres nothing to grab on to!
-Ive got to think of something fast. -Oh, come on, Pikachu!
- -Agh! Were going to fall!
I know!
- -Ash, grab ahold!
Ash, Pikachu, just hang on.
You saved us.
-Pika. - Ah!
-Ill pull you up now. -But your camera is ruined!
You sacrificed your camera to save us?
Dont you worry about my camera, Ash.
-You just worry about holding on. -Okay!
You did a great job for us, Todd.
-Huh? -Prepare for trouble.
Make it double.
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie! -James!
-Huh? -Team Rocket!
Team Rocket blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Meowth! Thats right!
-And we just netted ourselves a Pikachu! -Pika!
-Pikachu! -Why did you trick me?
You tricked us first, little shutterbug.
We wanted you to take Pikachu, not take its picture.
But thanks for helping us snap up the real Pikachu.
And just to show our gratitude, why dont you have one of these?
Looks like I need a little work on my aim. Ugh.
-Todd! -Pikachu!
Ha, ha. Squirm all you want.
Youll never get out of this rubber bag.
-Could we wind this up now, please? -Will do.
Huh?
-Ha-ha. -And the final pitch...
- Hold it! -Huh?
Okay, everybody, just smile for the camera.
Youre going to love this shot.
- -Whats the magic word?
Cheese!
-Oh, let me just take the shine off. - Now look to the right.
Oh, look at my face.
-You ruined the shot. -Oh!
Oh. Okay, Todd, lets give Team Rocket our best shot.
- - Bulbasaur, go!
-Bulbasaur! -Bulbasaur, Razor Leaf, now!
Bulba!
- -Cut it out!
-Run for it, Pikachu! -Pi! Pikachu!
Bulbasaur, give them your Vine Whip!
-Bulbasaur! -
Quick! Get to the water!
- A waterfall! -
But first, a poem.
Team rocket drifted down the stream and now we scream!
-Nice work, Ash! -Thanks.
-Bulbasaur, return! -Bulba!
-Hey, Ash! Todd! Over here! -Are you okay?
You guys missed all the excitement.
You should have brought a camera.
- Huh? -Pika-pi! Chu!
Huh? Whoa!
I dont get it. How come you guys are acting like friends?
We are friends, Misty, because we have something in common.
We both like Pokemon.
-Imagine, those two friends. -I never pictured it.
I dont usually photograph humans, but this time, Ill make an exception.
I want to remember my new friends forever.
-Get my good side. -Okay, get ready.
Wah-wah-wah!
Whoa!
One picture is worth 1,000 words but a new friend is priceless.
