Zeref...
You are mine...
I'm not going to give you up to anyone... Anyone.
I will make you king of the world.
All for the the World of Great Magic...
That thing's persistent!
At this rate, the both of us will...
Why are you stopping?
A dead end?
Man!
Now look here...
Ark of Embodiment.
You idiot!
Is your brain made of muscle?
Try thinking about where you're escaping to next time!
Clam it!
How'bout you try runnin' yourself next time!
I've taken a lot of damage! I can just now barely stand!
You still seem plenty kickin' to me!
Hold up a sec...
What're we supposed to do now?
If that thing goes wild like it did before, this cliff is gonna break quick!
As for me, I can fly. But, you...
Oh, yeah!
We could do that!
What? You're so annoying.
I knew those glasses you wear make you smart!
Now look here... I'm smart even without the glasses.
Among all the Fairies, I'm the most...
So there you go!
What?!
Heave-ho!
Hey, big-boy!
Over here!
We'll have a head-to-head battle, Man-to-Man!
Now bring it on, fair and square!
Take Over: Beast Soul!
Gotcha!
Hold it!
Hey there.
How about that? Worked like a cha-
Don't go making me the decoy just'cause I can fly!
I'm gonna fall!
The communication between two lovers...
That's not how it is!
Great!
You did well in defeating my Sacred Guardian Beast, Thunderclap Belcusas.
You truly showed me well your pitiful struggle against death...
But you fight with not even a hint of elegance, unbefitting of a wizard...
Honestly...
I think I'm going to puke.
Even in the World of Great Magic
that will shortly be upon us, trash like you will not be needed.
Those without magic power will be eliminated, and only wizards will be left alive?
A World of Great Magic, you say?
Give me a break.
Only 10 of people in the world are wizards!
The other 90 don't have any magic!
That's right. In the World of Great Magic, those 90 cannot survive.
You think we'll let you get away with that?
But what're they for?
Humans who can't use magic are no better than a candle that can't be lit!
They have no use!
Everyone in this world is here because we help one another to survive!
Belcusas's attack from before must have injured his arm.
Help one another? Are you talking about guilds?
That's your ego.
You people are powerless. All you do is eat up resources!
No...
We all need each other.
We bring the power, and the normal people pay the rewards.
The world is built up from those requests...
That's how guilds were born.
Don't you dare belittle guilds.
How dare you talk dirt about those wizards struggling just to survive!
In the end, you people cannot understand.
You cannot get close to the true depths of magic...
You, who do not know the true terror of Zeref.
When Zeref shows his true power...
You will be able to do nothing, nothing, nothing except grovel before him!
Fairy Tail will never bow down!
Because we're a giant candle that shines light down on the deepest darkness!
Take this!
Fairy Tail, huh?
Not as elegant as your name would suggest.
As I thought!
Trash like you aren't needed in the World of Great Magic!
Elfman!
Call me trash if you want!
But I'll never forgive you calling my friends trash!
A Man cannot let that stand!
Is that so?
Elfman!
I got you.
The basics of a Take Over is to know your opponent.
Isn't that right, Nee-chan?
I'll be taking this arm!
My Blade of Darkness!
Take this!
In my left hand dwells a shield of gold that defends against all!
You underestimated me. I won't be beaten so...
What I was really after was your glasses!
Now, Ever!
The only people who can call me that are the Raijinshuu and Laxus.
But this time I'll let you do it, special.
Because I can make sure the mouth of someone who insults Fairy Tail
never opens again by turning them into stone!
Shoot!
Stone Eyes!
But that's...
Why didn't my Stone Eyes...?
Ever!
Ah...
Even with the bodies of the two loves in front of me,
I could not be moved, even a tad.
It was quite a fun act.
Glasses?
But I'm sure I...
My magic is the power of imagination.
The Ark of Embodiment.
Anything I wish for is immediately embodied into reality.
That magic is ridiculous...
Making dreams incarnate is near the very basis of magic.
Of course, there are a number of limits and conditions.
An invincible, undefeated magic!
I have never been beaten! Not even once!
Come forth, Dimguil's Tower!
Blast these foolish Fairies with all that sadness, and return them to dust!
What is this?
I can't move!
Elf...man...
Ever! Hang in there!
I'm sorry...
If I wasn't your partner, you might've become an S Class Wizard.
You might not've lost to a guy like this...
Fool...
It's because you were here that I made it this far, you know?
Elfman...
Thank you, Ever.
Scatter, into the distant darkness.
Natsu-san!
Natsu!
Gramps!
Over here.
He's still in a rough state.
H-Huh? My scarf?
Wendy fixed it for you!
She also flipped your clothes back around.
Thanks, Wendy!
I-It's nothing.
What's the matter?
Um...
Don't go sniffing a lady, you pervert!
This smell!
Natsu, what smell?
I remember now.
Why was he here?
Who is he talking about?
Wendy, do you know?
I can't tell...
Everyone's smell kind of blends together and I can't tell who is where.
So, Natsu... Who did you smell?
That guy I met on Galuna Island.
Perhaps you recall this masked person.
Calling himself Zalty,
he tried to work behind the scenes in a dark plot to obtain Deliora,
one of Zeref's Demons, from its slumber on Galuna Island.
But he was defeated by Natsu and disappeared.
He's close!
Natsu!
Natsu-san!
There he goes...
Galuna Island?
Who?
This and that and this and that... It was a pretty tough fight.
Lost Magic?
That Zancrow fellow said something like that, too.
I'm impressed he remembers the smell.
He's like a beast.
Well, that's Natsu for you.
It is?
That it is.
I'm... in a pickle.
I haven't seen Zeref...
And no one's around...
And I'm starving...
But you know what they say...
When you eat meat you start craving sweets.
I figured this might happen, so...
I brought ice cream with me!
Go, me!
Okay. Seems everyone's safe.
Transport the injured to the tents stretched out on the reef.
Hurry and treat them!
We can deal with fixing the equipment later!
Perhaps you recall, but this man is Lahar.
He's the Captain of the 4th Enforcement and Detention Corps of the Reformed Magic Council.
He once took Jellal into custody after the Nirvana incident,
and is now leading the warships watching over Tenroujima.
We'll be heading onto the island now.
Everyone who can prepare for battle...
Dranbalt...
Let me explain once again who this man, Mest, really is.
He called himself Mest, but his real name is Dranbalt.
He's a member of the Reformed Magic Council's Intelligence Service.
What is someone like you doing so injured?
I'm fine.
What about the ships?
I'd like to say we're fine, but at least there were no casualties.
Is the communications lacrima safe?
Thankfully...
What in the world happened on the island?
A three-way battle between Fairy Tail, Grimoire Heart,
and the Black Wizard Zeref has begun.
The attack on the ship before was from Grimoire Heart.
Lend me the communications lacrima!
I've got to report this to headquarters right away!
I-I don't believe it...
Three of the thorns in the side of the Magic World have all gathered in one place?
The chances of this being coincidence are nearly zero...
Gran Doma, the chairman, is strict
and will not hesitate to eliminate wrongdoers without even a trial.
Will he let fall the Attack of Sealed Light once again?
Etherion?!
Although we have no way to oppose the decisions of our superiors...
Hold it! It's true that Fairy Tail's always been at odds with the Council,
but they shouldn't be lumped in with Zeref and Grimoire Heart!
That is not for us to decide.
Now, hurry and contact headquarters.
The World of Great Magic...
Everyone without magic will be eliminated?
That's not right!
That's a horrible world where no one gains anything!
Master Hades has not informed meh of his true intentions,
but perhaps it will be a land of those who know the depths of magic.
Zeref is on this island.
When weh get our hands on him,
the world will beh enveloped with magic and reborn anew.
This is stupid.
I hope you're prepared for the consequences when you make a mess outta someone else's house!
Meh orders are two.
The first is to capture Zeref and hand him over to Master Hades.
The second is to wipe out Fairy Tail.
Wipe us out? Just try it!
Wait.
Loke...
I'll fight him.
If he calls himself one of the 7 Kin of Purgatory,
then we should assume there are 6 more at his level.
The rest of you, search for the other Kin of Purgatory and defeat them.
What the hell are you talking about?
Even all 4 of us couldn't scratch him!
That's because of his magic.
An ancient magic... Human Subordination Magic.
Human... Subordination?
It's magic that allows you to command a human's fighting power or magic for a time.
It's also known as the Magic of Kings.
But that magic won't work on me, a Celestial Spirit.
Plus, you may have already realized it, but he's also a Spirit.
The Goat, Capricorn.
What?
A Spirit?
No...
Two Spirits fighting each other?
It's just like that time!
In that case, we'll...
Don't say anything.
I've requested a one-on-one match between two Spirits, Capricorn!
I see.
I had thought you'd completely forgotten that you were a Spirit, Leo.
Go, everyone.
But...
It's tough, but Loke's right.
As long as we're under his magic spell, we can't fight for real.
Let's leave this to Loke.
Loke...
You could tell from the fight before, right?
Humans can't beat this guy.
But if two Spirits are fighting each other, I have to be...
Hurry and go!
It's rare for him to raise his voice...
There's got to be some history here...
Figure it out, Lucy!
You believe in him, right?
Yeah.
Good. I'm worried about the others. Let's go!
Loke!
Make sure to come back to me, you hear?!
No matter what!
Lucy!
That girl...
Regulus, give me the power...
How many years has it been since you disappeared from the Spirit World?
17 years.
To stay in the Human World that long... Who the hell is your master?!
No one is meh master.
It is meh who is the master of humans!
Hero of Rubenguard, I open thee!
A gate to another world?
San Jiao Shin!
W-What was that just now?
During the civil war of Rubenguard in 779,
there was a young general, San Jiao Shin, who led the rebel army to victory.
The official records say he went missing after the war.
But the truth is that he became meh subordinate.
He captured a human, and summoned him?!
Now then, let meh ask you about your master.
Why do you care?
So that I can subordinate her, of course.
I've already deduced that it's the blond woman who ran away.
You want a one-on-one battle with meh?
That's a lie.
You said that to let your master escape to a safe location.
Spirits sure have to take the worst roles, you know?
Make sure to come back to me, you hear?!
No matter what!
Make sure... to come back to me.
No matter what!
C-Could it be... That woman...
He realized!
That's why you're keeping her away from meh!
Keeping her away from meh!
That woman...
Is she Layla Heartfilia's daughter?
Crap... He really figured it out...
I can't let her live!
Where is she?!
I smell it, I smell it!
Man, can I ever!
Wait, Natsu!
Why do you want to finish things with that guy from Galuna Island?
There's a point to it!
Although his mask was pretty cool...
Cool? How?
So by smell, do you mean the smell of sweat inside the mask?
No, not that!
Anyway, take this seriously!
The Zalty that Natsu has gotten wind of is actually...
Zeref...
I will make the future.
There are two sheep... Er, two people.
Huh? What about sheep?
Spirits.
The fluffy Spirit Lucy has is a sheep, right?
Aries? Right, a sheep.
Isn't Loke also fighting a sheep?
Do Spirits have twins or something?
They are a bit similar, but this one's a goat.
Next time: Human Gate.
What's the difference?
Goats go meh, while sheep go beh.
Uh, I can't tell the difference at all.
