I'm back, Gramps!
Is the bath water hot?
I have to hurry or I'll be late!
Is it so serious that she can't have visitors?
That voice...
Yes... Kagome is laid up in bed.
I see.
Err... This is a hot compress for Kagome...
Oh, you're so thoughtful!
My... I mean, her neuralgia will get much better with this.
I'll be going then.
Okay, take care.
Who has neuralgia?
Oh, Kagome! Be happy!
You're supposed to be disposed today, so you can miss school.
What are you saying?! I WANT to go to school desperately!
You're a strange one.
Only my family knows of my jaunts through the hidden well...
into the Feudal States Era.
Besides, I doubt that anyone else would believe me if I told them.
Huh? You're going to take the math supplement course, too?
Teacher told me to.
We're used to it, but it's a shock to hear that you need it, too.
The high school Hojo is applying to is very difficult to get into.
What? Don't tell me you're seeing Hojo, Kagome?!
Stop it! Who has time to go out with boys?!
That's not something you want to brag about.
Err... Well...
Gee, I don't even know if I'll be able to get into high school!
Not with a life like this!
Oh, look! Fireworks!
So pretty!
It looks like fun!
Huh?
Ha-ha-ha! Serves them right!
That girl!
Hold it!
What did you do that for?!
You... You can see me?
Who is this girl?
Where're her shoes?
And a down jacket... when it's almost summer?
Let's go apologize. I'll go with you.
None of your business!
What's the matter, Kagome?
Who were you talking to?
Huh?!
Gone... Who was she?
Myoga, isn't it finished?
Not yet.
Master Inuyasha, if you go out now, you'll be stung to death.
That sheathe was cracked battling the Thunder Brothers.
Let the steel wasps repair it with their special wax.
Dang it... It's boring!
Shut up!
I came along because I thought Kagome would be here!
Why must I be stuck alone with you?!
That's my line!
Arghh... Why am I alone with you?!
Don't I count at all?
Huh?
That's...
A goblin!
Shippo... So are you!
That's the Soul Piper.
It was born from the souls of departed children.
When a child dies, the Soul Piper plays with that child...
until the soul is able to rest in peace.
As long as its eyes are closed, it's a peaceful demon.
What?! Not when I've come back to this world!
Jeepers! Why do I have to accompany you...
to visit YOUR friend in the hospital?!
Because the hospital's in the next town...
and Mom's too busy to take me today.
Cripes! Everyone's interfering with my studies!
Sis...
What?
Is there such a thing as an evil spirit?
Huh?
Sota, thank you for coming so often.
Aunty, how is Satoru?
Physically, he's healed.
But he's still unconscious.
Here...
Thank you so much for worrying about Satoru.
Burn scars?
Oh these...
I got them from the fire six months ago.
Oh, I'm sorry!
That's how Satoru...
Huh?!
The girl at the park...!
She disappeared!
Again... Why must this happen?
Who is she anyway?
I can't ignore this.
Darn, foiled again!
You mentioned an evil spirit. What did you mean, Sota?
I thought maybe an evil spirit was after Satoru...
Satoru has been in a coma since the fire six months ago.
At first, all my classmates went to visit him at the hospital.
But...
weird things happened on their way home...
like falling down the stairs...
or barely missing getting hit by a car...
After these things kept happening, the kids stayed away.
In that fire six months ago, she died...
Satoru's older sister.
Her name was Mayu.
- Is that the place? - Uh-huh...
Whenever they tried to clean up after the fire...
an accident would happen.
So it's been like that for six months now.
Watch out!
I knew it! There is an evil spirit!?
Sota!
Huh?! Watch out!
Stupid! I'm already dead.
You're Mayu, aren't you?
Why do you do these things?
Aren't you Satoru's sister?
Satoru, ! I'll kill him!
Mom hated me!
That's why she abandoned me!
She never wanted me!
Mayu... She seems so nice. Don't make her unhappy anymore.
Be quiet!
If you keep interfering, I'll kill you, too!
Huh?!
Huh?
Until my eyes...
are open?
Until my eyes are open? What does that mean?
So that demon is called the Soul Piper?
Uh-huh... So you have it in your world, too?
It's supposed to console the souls of dead children.
It plays its flute until the souls find peace.
And if the soul cannot find peace?
If the soul has regrets or harbors a grudge...
Then that spirit becomes an evil spirit.
Evil spirit?!
When regrets turn to rage and hatred in a spirit...
it becomes evil.
Upon becoming an evil spirit...
the Soul Piper hurls it into the depths of hell.
When the Soul Piper's eyes are fully open, it's too late.
I won't allow that!
Mayu must find peace!
Forget it, Kagome!
Ghosts are different from demons.
You can't just slay them.
One misstep and you'll regret it.
But I can't ignore it!
I come from a shrine family!
There must be something I can do!
Kagome is already gone. Fool!
I can't ignore her.
That girl has so much sadness in her.
Mom, I want a cotton kimono with goldfish on it.
When the summer comes, I'll go to the fairs...
and catch lots and lots of his goldfish friends.
I want to wear my cotton kimono then.
Mayu, summer's a long ways off.
That's okay. Promise?
All right!
When Mom leaves the hospital tonight...
I'm going to kill her dear, little Satoru.
You're going home now?
Yes. I'll see you again tomorrow.
Take care.
Excuse me...
Oh, you're Sota's sister?
Umm... About Satoru's late sister...
We've been waiting for you! Please go around!
That day...
Stupid Mommy!
Why didn't you come to the Open House?!
It couldn't be helped.
Satoru's temperature shot up.
All you care about is Satoru!
Mayu!
I hate you and Satoru!
Mayu, just a minute!
Mayu!
We always had arguments like that.
On that day, when Mayu ran off...
I thought, Oh, there she goes again.
But...
If I had known that Mayu was inside the apartment...
A child! Poor thing!
If I had known, I would have gone back...
If I had only known!
She wasn't aware that Mayu was inside during the fire.
That's Satoru's room!
Mayu!
Mayu, stop!
M-Mayu!
Why?!
Quiet!
Mayu, think hard!
Did your mother really abandon you?
Maybe she didn't know you were inside the apartment during that fire?
Brrr... It was cold!
Sis... You're not supposed to hang things above the heater...
when Mom is not at home.
Oh, be quiet!
Don't you dare tell Mom that I'm hiding here.
I want to make her worry!
That muffler caught on fire!
It's all my fault.
Mom's not to blame.
Even Satoru...
Mayu...
Satoru!
Huh?!
He fell!
Cripes! I can't stand to watch you!
Inuyasha!
You came!
Didn't I tell you not to get involved?
It's too late for that little kid.
Making her realize the truth doesn't mean she'll find peace.
It ain't that simple!
Huh?! The eyes!
Aghh! What's this?!
No! No!
Remember this! I don't know anything about ghosts!
So you work it out!
I must help Mayu find peace before she falls into hell.
This is what Myoga said...
the Soul Piper takes the spirit to the spot where the death occurred...
then drags it down into hell!
Look over there! Seems pretty dangerous to me!
Inuyasha, let me off here.
Fool! Did you really think you can manage alone?
No wonder they say that...
there's nothing scarier than an ignoramus!
Oh that's right... This is where humans get sucked into hell.
Only humans like Kagome can proceed any further.
Damn! This is one time I'm totally helpless!
It's pitch black. Where am I?
A light?
Huh?! You're conscious!
Umm... What happened?
Never mind... Look at Satoru!
Huh?!
Satoru!
Mom...
Mom... Umm...
Sis is inside the closet.
Please hurry and get her!
This is how I died.
I couldn't be saved...
Mayu!
Mayu!
Who is that?! Mom?!
Where are you?!
Answer!
Mayu!
Hurry! Let's get out of here!
Are you crazy?! I'm already dead!
I don't have a home anymore!
Mayu!
Mayu!
You're going home, Mayu.
You're going home and make peace with your mother.
Your mother loves you so very much!
Is it okay if you never see her again?
She's not angry?
Mom's not angry at me?
Don't you worry. She's your mother!
Try to remember...
about your mother...
Mom!
I want to see you one more time, so I can say I'm sorry!
I wanted to make up with you!
Mayu...
Mommy!
Mayu!
Mommy!
I'm sorry...
Mayu...
I have to go now.
I hope it worked.
Cripes! You get into such scrapes!
One wrong move and you'd have been dragged into hell...
with that impish evil spirit!
Evil spirit...
One week later, Satoru was released from the hospital.
Kagome!
Mayu!
I wanted to thank you before I left.
Such a pretty cotton kimono!
Mom sewed it for me.
Thanks for everything. Bye-bye!
Mayu, you weren't meant to be an evil spirit.
You were just a little girl who loved her mother very much.
Inuyasha... Half-demon and half-human.
Inuyasha's goal is to gather the fragments of the Sacred Jewel...
to become a full-fledged demon.
During our search for the fragments...
we come to the rescue of a girl named Nazuna.
She takes us to spend the night at an old temple.
The Spider Lord lurks in the shadows... Is it a trap?
But on this moonless night, a secret weakness is revealed!
The Mystery of the New Moon and the Black-haired Inuyasha!
Don't miss it!
