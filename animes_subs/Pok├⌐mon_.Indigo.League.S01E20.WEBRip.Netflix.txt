Once again, we join our hero, Ash
on his continuing quest to become a Pokemon Master.
With his friends Brock, Misty and Pikachu,
Ash's next adventure is on the horizon.
- Wow. look at those rocks. -Pi.
That's a long drop.
Fall from here and the ball game's over.
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
The map says that this ridge leads right to Saffron City.
And to our next challenge at the Saffron Gym.
Yeah. huh?
-What are those? - They look like Butterfree.
The Butterfree are celebrating their season of love.
-Love? - Yeah.
The season of love is when Butterfree lay their eggs.
The Butterfree find mates and then lay their eggs across the sea.
- Across the sea? - That's right.
How cute.
You mean my Butterfree would go too?
If you don't let it cross the sea, it will never have babies.
Hm. Babies?
I'm surprised there was a hot air balloon for rent out here.
We'll probably see lots of other balloons once we get up into the air.
Hold on, guys.
Heh, what a view.
- - Huh?
- Look, there they are. - Let's go.
Butterfree!
Wow, all the Butterfree are pairing off into couples.
-Okay, Ash. -Oh, right.
Butterfree, go!
-Go out there and find your mate. -Good luck, Butterfree.
Huh?
Maybe none of those Butterfree is its type.
What do you mean by its type, Brock?
The Butterfree all look exactly the same to me.
Some must fly better than others
or maybe they have slightly different patterns, I guess.
-Huh? - Huh?
Look at all the balloons.
They're all Butterfree trainers. They come at this time every year
to release their Butterfree.
Oh.
You just go find yourself a nice mate, Butterfree, go!
Oh, no, not this again.
-Butterfree. -Listen up, Butterfree.
See the Butterfree that girl just released?
Don't you get it? If two Butterfree fall in love
their trainers will meet and they can fall in love too.
-Oh. -Don't butt into Pokemon love affairs.
But, Misty, if Butterfree doesn't find a mate
it won't ever have babies.
Go ahead, then.
Free! Free!
Go get them, Butterfree.
The perfect mate for you is got to be out there somewhere.
Free! Free!
Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! Free!
It looks like Butterfree really found someone it likes.
Yeah, love at first sight with that pink one.
Butterfree's acting kind of weird.
That's Butterfree's courtship dance.
Courtship dance?
It's Butterfree's way of saying: I want to be your Butterfree.
Oh, that's so romantic.
If it's successful, the other Butterfree does a dance too.
It's doing something.
What's going on?
Free! Free! Free! Free! Free...
Free...
-Butterfree got shot down. -What? That's so mean. That isn't fair.
Butterfree. Where are you going?
Butterfree!
Shot down in its prime.
Butterfree! Hey, Butterfree!
- Butterfree. -Pikachu.
-Butterfree. Come out. -Butterfree. Where are you?
It's Butterfree.
Hey, there, Butterfree, are you okay?
Free...
-Hey, how come you look so sad, buddy? -It was rejected by someone it loved.
That's a terrible shock. Believe me, it's a terrible feeling.
I could write a book about the secrets of love and heartache.
I guess that book would be your autobiography.
Pikachu. Pika, Pikachu.
Pika. Pikachu.
Do you think maybe Dexter might be able to tell us
how Butterfree can get that other Butterfree to be its mate?
Dexter's never been in love.
I just don't understand it. My Butterfree's great.
Why would any other Butterfree reject it?
Butterfree, maybe you just have to show off your strengths
and let the others see how great you are.
Show how powerful your Tackle is or how you can use Stun Spore.
That's right, Butterfree. You've got to be assertive.
Love is all about attacking your opponent first.
Get in a quick punch and surprise them, then while they're still weak
take the lead and you'll beat them hands down.
Trust me, I know that's the best way to win.
-You mean it? -Sure do. That's love.
-Ah! I wish I'd known that sooner. -Let's give it another try.
-Hold it. -Huh?
A new look might help.
-Heh. -Yeah, that looks great.
Free! Free!
We got to find it. Where did that pink Butterfree go?
-This is important to you, isn't it? -I raised that Butterfree myself
and I'll show them all how good it is.
Heh, it looks like the trainer is just as passionate as the Butterfree.
All right, there it is.
Now, Butterfree, this time just have confidence in yourself.
-Go. -Pika.
Free!
Butterfree! Show it your Whirlwind attack!
Hm. Now use your Tackle. That should do the trick.
Free! Free! Free! Free!
- -Free...
- Shot down again. -Pikachu.
-Huh? -What's that?
- Prepare for trouble. - Make it double.
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
-To renounce the evils of truth and love. -To extend our reach to the stars above.
- Jessie. - James.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Meowth. That's right.
Ha-ha! Look at all the Butterfree.
All ours for the taking.
Let's do some networking, ha-ha!
Look! They're stealing the Butterfree.
It's those little twerps again.
No matter where we go, those kids are always in our way.
But this time they can't do a thing to stop us.
Hey, knock it off.
Stop or you're going to disrupt their whole egg-laying season.
Can't you see these Butterfree are in love?
Heh, we're in love too, little girl, with all the pretty little Pokemon.
Those Butterfree are free no more.
Argh! We've got to stop them.
Quit it! Leave'em alone!
We're having quiet a spree.
-We're swiping all of the Butterfree. -There's never been a happier me.
Can't we speed this thing up and catch them?
I'm trying, Ash, but their chopper's a lot faster.
Huh.
Ha-ha, nothing but net.
Free!
Free! Free!
Free! Free!
Yeah. That's it, Butterfree! Use your Tackle Attack.
Huh, that pathetic little insect thinks it can stop us.
Butterfree, Stun Spore now!
Ha-ha-ha! That was a stunning failure.
I guess I'm going to have to use Pidgeotto then.
Wait a minute. You can't do that.
Just think how Butterfree would feel. It's trying its hardest out there.
All right.
All right. What a catch.
Now let's hit the skyway.
Our thanks to all of you who came to see Team Rocket's latest triumph.
-We hope to see you again. - Next time we steal the show.
Hey, come back!
Free! Free!
-Butterfree! After it. -Here goes.
-I don't see Butterfree or Team Rocket. -
Butterfree was flying as fast as it could.
I bet it's going to follow that pink Butterfree no matter where they take it.
Butterfree, where are you?
Pika!
- Butterfree! -Pika!
-Please, Butterfree! -Hey, Butterfree!
Free! Free!
-Ah, Butterfree. -Free! Free!
Free! Free!
What happened?
- -Chu, chu?
-Is the pink Butterfree over there? -Free! Free!
Don't worry. Show us the way, Butterfree.
98 Meowth, 99 Meowth, 100 Meowth, hee-hee-hee!
- A very nice catch. - Just between us, isn't it nice
to have one of our nefarious schemes actually work for once?
Feels great.
We're at our best when we're at our worst.
We've finally got it back.
Yeah, when the boss hears about this, I'll be top cat again.
Na-na-na!
-Hey, somebody's busting in. -Who is it? who's there?
-Prepare for trouble. -And you can make that triple.
To protect the world from devastation.
-To unite all peoples within our nation. -To unite all peoples within our nation.
-This was just- -Too good.
-To last. -You got that right.
Pika!
We're defending the beauty of truth and love.
-Let's do it. -We got to stop them!
-Today is the one day. -You won't win.
Butterfree, go.
Go, Starmie!
Starmie, Tackle attack.
Free! Free!
Free! Free!
The Butterfree are getting away! Do something!
Take this.
Hang in there, Starmie.
Hurry up, fly away.
Wait. Stop them. They're getting away. hurry.
Are you all right, Butterfree?
Free! Free! Free!
I'll get you.
Free!
We won't let them get away, argh!
- Stop! Come back! - Wait!
We're going to get every one of them back.
Hurry. Faster.
There's team rocket. Over there.
The flock of Butterfree.
No, they're doing it again.
Pikachu!
Pikachu, what are you two going to do?
Pika!
What's that?
Huh?
Pika!
Huh?
It's going to shock us. It's going to shock us. It's going to shock us.
It's going to shock us. It's going to...
-We were so close this time. -
Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again!
We did it.
That'll teach'em not to play around with a Pokemon romance.
-Free! -Pika.
-You did it, Pikachu. Great work. -Pi. Pikachu.
Free!
Free! Free!
Hey, look.
Free! Free! Free!
Heh, now the pink Butterfree
is doing the courtship dance for your Butterfree.
-All right, good for you, Butterfree. -Chu.
Free! Free! Free! Free!
Well, I guess you have to leave us now, don't you?
They have to cross the ocean and start their new family.
-I'll miss you, Butterfree. -It's time.
I'll say goodbye, then.
This is a great Butterfree, so take care of it for me.
Free! Free!
-Your babies are going to be beautiful. -I guess you better get going.
Free!
Free!
Don't worry. I'll just tell all the other Pokemon that you're on a trip
and you'll come back someday maybe.
Free! Free! Free!
Goodbye, Butterfree.
-Bye-bye, Butterfree. -Good luck to both of you.
Pikachu.
Butterfree.
Hey, Ash, Butterfree's almost out of sight.
Huh?
Take care, Butterfree! Good luck, buddy!
Free!
Goodbye, Butterfree. I'll always remember you.
Thank you for everything. Goodbye, Butterfree!

-Isn't that beautiful? -It sure is.

Good friendships last forever
even though friends don't always stay together.
