I realized that the time had come to face the problem I had been ignoring
by not thinking too deeply about it.
Yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, keep going on
Baby I'm standing alone
An unforgettable rainy day
Chasing after your shadow
And it's over, it's like sand now
I sigh every night
I scream like a child and cried
It hangs there quietly, my sorrow
Please, please God, forgive my sins
I don't need to hide no more
Flowing toward the turquoise light
Just keep going on
You've got the chance now
You've got the power
Know you gotta be so true to yourself
I show you my life now
I show you my love now
I show you my everything yeah yeah
You'd better change now You'd better catch now
Don't ever change so be yourself
I'll show you my strength now
I'll show you my love now
I'll show you my everything yeah yeah
Baby don't be afraid
Yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, keep going on
Yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, keep going on

Why does being pregnant make me so sleepy every day?

SEPTEMBER 24 NOBU HOW ARE YOU?
RECEIVED MAIL SEPTEMBER 2402:36 NOBU HOW ARE YOU?
HOW ARE YOU? I WANT TO HAVE A PROPER TALK WITH YOU. IS IT POSSIBLE? I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY.
NO NEW MESSAGES
Nobu!
Yasu says lunch is ready.
Spaghetti with mushrooms!
I think we can count on a tasty meal. Yasu's cooking is the best.
Who are you expecting a reply from?
You've been checking your email all morning.
Well, you know, because the reception is bad here.
But you usually leave your cell phone in your room.
Shin, do something about that habit of yours of closely observing others.
Sorry. But you're easy to figure out even without observing closely.
I don't want you figuring me out!
But I can.
It's dangerous here.
Looking at the night sky, it's as if you can reach the stars.
You get the feeling that your dreams will come true.
Shin, thank you for your email.
I feel it's been a long time since I've seen that many stars.
Even if I close my eyes,
I can only imagine artificial neon lights like in a planetarium.
SHIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR EMAIL. I FEEL IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE SEEN THAT MANY STARS. EVEN IF I CLOSE MY EYES, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE ARTIFICIAL NEON LIGHTS LIKE IN A PLANETARIUM.
SHIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR EMAIL. I FEEL IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE SEEN THAT MANY STARS. EVEN IF I CLOSE MY EYES, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE ARTIFICIAL NEON LIGHTS LIKE IN A PLANETARIUM. Because I thought I'm no different from such neon lights.

PHEW
Thank you, Nami. You have quite the tan.
No! Yes! I mean, I'm sorry, I'm kinda nervous!
I've been a big fan of Trapnest since your debut!
Really?
Don't question her. She's being polite.
Honey!
You think this pattern is too flashy?
You don't need to wear a tie.
Gotta look dignified as a father.
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Pleased to meet you. I'm Takumi Ichinose.
You sure are tall! H-How tall are you?!
A meter and eighty-three centimeters, right?
I wasn't asking you. Fawning all over him...
I apologize that it took so long before I could come.
These are some gifts from England.
Though, the only thing British about it is the tea.
- Oh my, this much? - What is it?
Wow, thanks brother!
I'll follow you for the rest of my life!
How cozy!
It's beautiful! Your father would never buy me things like this.
You certainly seem to be well-off, Mr. Ichinose.
Do celebrities get paid that well?
It depends on the person.
After all, you're profits are determined by your popularity.
That's true.
Are you sure you can provide for my daughter and her child
for the rest of their lives?
I'll do all right, sir.
Sir?!
He seems like an untrustworthy guy.
I may be a celebrity on the outside, but I'm just a workman.
It's difficult to continue a band regardless of its popularity.
I'd like to be in the same band forever,
but that's not something that I alone can determine.

THINKING BACK, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I WAS ABLE TO COME THIS FAR WITH MY SINGING NO MATTER HOW TOUGH THINGS GOT. with my singing no matter how tough things got.
All right, okay. We're done.
Done already?
We've done enough.
At your current level as a singer,
it'll be the same, no matter how many times we record.
In other words, you've given it all you've got for now and it was great.
What's that supposed to mean?
We can artificially adjust the high notes you have trouble reaching.
Do some voice training before the live performance,
so you don't embarrass yourself.
Otherwise, even the music magazines will start writing nasty things about you.
Shut up! Stop laughing! Let me sing it again!
Well then, now that we're done with the recording,
what do you say we go fishing?
Yeah, that sounds like fun.
All right!
That's the one thing I've been looking forward to doing here.
The one thing?!
Matsuo!
Let me sing some more!
Keep it down! You'll scare off all the fish!
Say, why did your wife leave you?
I think the number one reason Gaia decided to record at that training camp

Mr. Ichinose. What about your family?
How many siblings do you have?
You have a big sister, right?!
We're not asking you.
Honey...
Would you let me talk too?! This isn't any fun!
But you hardly know a damn thing about my family, do you?
Damn?
Excuse me.
Oh, that's not a problem at all!
You can use that language with me whenever you damn please!
It's not fine! Not at all! And your Japanese is funny!
Nami, go buy some sake.
Yes, you do that.
And pick up some ingredients for the sukiyaki too.
Huh? No way!
Besides, what are the ingredients? Meat?
Let's take the car and go together, Nami. Okay?
You wanna go out with your new handbag, don't you?
Don't tell me you like Nami. Please, anyone but her.
I'm so sorry! Nana and Nami are both such noisy girls.
Me too?! Don't group me with Nami!
Not at all. I'm enjoying this very much.
My mother was very weak,
and the rest of my family was rather dark.
Perhaps because of that,
since I was small I've always been drawn to energetic, happy people.
That's why I find this so attractive.
The feeling of a loving family like yours. This is fun.
I see.
Well, one thing I can guarantee is Nana's in good health.
So how is your family doing now?
My mother passed away six years ago.
My sister married a local man.
They now live with their two children and our father.
Okay, then we should give them a visit sometime soon.
We'll all go and pay our respects at your mother's grave.
Yes, we should.
No, it's okay.
- Huh? - Huh?
In fact, my father is a complete alcoholic,
and lately he can't even manage a proper conversation.
I'm sorry.
An alcoholic. That must be tough for you.
But we still should go and introduce ourselves.
No, it's really all right.
He's the type of man that wouldn't even attend
my sister's wedding or my mother's funeral.
Besides, I have no intention of inviting him to our wedding.
I wouldn't want him ruining it.
If there's something not right about the father,
the child isn't gonna amount to much.
I'm a good example.
More importantly, about the location of the wedding ceremony,
would you mind taking a look at these documents?
Hey, guy. You're not a salesman.
Honey! You just called him Guy!
Ren?
Ren. You'll catch a cold if you sleep here.
Here. Come here like a good boy.
Come on.
Reira?
I'm sorry. I guess I dozed off.
Did Mr. Honjo have a bit too much to drink?
Is he okay?
Yeah. This always happens.
Help me carry him to the bed.
Sure.

REN MESSAGE FOR NANA
REN MESSAGE FOR NANA I GOT BACK IN JAPAN TODAY. PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL.
- Did you read it? - Yeah.
Without delay, the eight-day seven-night long recording
at the training camp finally came to an end.
But even after returning to Tokyo,
I can't go home while the place is still infested with them mosquitoes.
What are you reading, Shin? You're into literature, I see.
An erotic novel. Mika bought it for me at a book stand.
Is it any good, Shin?
Not at all.
Huh?
- No use trying to tease him, Mika. - Oh, Mika.
- I think Shin knows more about that - You can only touch him
- than you do. - from the neck up.
But this is good study material.
What study is that?!
THE HOUSEWIFE NEXT DOOR AI YAZAWA
THE HOUSEWIFE NEXT DOOR AI YAZAWA The Housewife Next Door?
THE HOUSEWIFE NEXT DOOR AI YAZAWA
Starting today,
we're all being thrown into the so-called agency's dormitory.
They just call it a dormitory.
It's really a regular apartment building.
It's for our agency's talents only, though.
Everyone gets his own room, there's no curfew,
and no nosy dorm supervisor.
But security and facilities are above standards,
so it's safe and comfortable!
I don't care what it is, as long as I can relax and get some sleep.
You're better off not opening the window.
That's a love hotel next door.
They're not likely to open their window too often either.
What's comfortable about this?! I don't get any sunlight here!
You have your own toilet and shower.
Where's the bathtub?
You're such a complainer! Who do you think you are?
If you wanna live the high life, then work your way up there.
I'll make certain that you have a full schedule starting tomorrow.
Wait, Ginpei! Is there a phone?
There's one on the first floor at the front desk!
The front desk?
At least buy a cell phone!
Work will be
- so inconvenient without one. - That's not a front desk!
And the security guard's asleep! What's the point of having one?
He's bored, which is proof of how safe it is.
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning at seven.
Don't go wandering off outside!
There's something wrong.
Something's definitely wrong about this production company.
Even the president was a weirdo.
Well, do your best.
No, I can't judge people on their appearances,
but this guy also looks like one of them.
Who are you, miss?
I'm Nana from the Black Stones!
I just introduced myself to you moments ago!
Oh right. Did you want something?
I wanna use the phone.
Go ahead and use it. It's free.
Forget it. I don't wanna be overheard.
I'll borrow Nobu's phone.
Really, go ahead and use it, miss!
But say I call Ren, what am I gonna say to him?
We're not gonna be able to see each other for a while anyway.
I actually would prefer that he leave me alone
rather than have him half-heartedly show some affection toward me.
That's what I should say to him.
I'm finding it hard to breathe. It must be because the air is dirty.
That's why I hate Tokyo.
Huh? The Black Stones? I know the band!
You do?
Well, it's famous, in a way!
No, not nearly as famous as you.
This is so exciting! Hey, come on in!
Huh? But...
Come on! Hurry!
Ow!
What are you doing, little man? You seem to be having fun.
Well, I was just saying hi to my neighbor.
Nana?
She's gorgeous! She sure is a celebrity!
It's the real Nana! Please give me your autograph!
Huh? Yuri Kosaka?
That adult video star?
You all seem to know her.
What the hell kind of agency is Shikai Corporation?!
Why are there adult video actresses working for it?!
Well, she did start out as an idol.
But when her popularity dipped, she took her clothes off.
You know a lot about her, Yasu.
And how could you make the dormitory coed?
That's borderline outrageous!
I'm guessing it's to accommodate or shelter their talents
with some sorta problem.
Like Ginpei was saying, they just call it a dormitory.
You're right.
But Miss Yuri's been in so many adult movies,
she must have money.
So why is she living in a shabby place like this?
MISS YURI?
MISS YURI? Miss Yuri?
Miss Yuri?
Nobu!
Switch rooms with me.
Huh?
With a starving wolf like you living next door,
Miss Yuri would be in danger!
I'm not gonna do anything! She's a pro!
I don't care! Just switch!
Why are you always so bossy?
Nobuo. I couldn't care less if you get off on porn videos.
But I hope you haven't forgotten our plan.
Plan?
To get Hachiko back! We pledged to fight together!
So don't get involved with other women!
What are you saying? You're misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding?
You were bashfully and gleefully chatting with Yuri!
No, not that.
I'm not necessarily fighting to get Hachi back.
And this is unrelated to that.
For me, Hachi and the band are separate issues.
Besides, why do I have to take care of Hachi
just so you can own her in your yard?
Honestly speaking, I have completely given up on her,
so do whatever you wish on your own.
But...
What? Damn, you're being stubborn.
Then what are we fighting for?
That's a stupid question.
We're fighting so our music will be accepted as that of a professional.
Hachi has nothing to do with it.
Nana?
Nobu is free to date whoever he wants.
But then, how do I stay connected to Hachi?
I can no longer go home to that place,
and even if I did, Hachi's no longer there.
Hey, Yasu, how do you read this kanji?
Itsuwari.
Lie.
Thanks.
NOBU
Yes?
Yasu!
Nana's...
Nana!
Shin, call an ambulance! The number's 119.
What's the address here?
Tell Mr. Yamagishi, the security guard and have him call one!
Okay!
We were talking and then all of a sudden,
she was short of breath and seemed to be in pain,
like she was having an attack.
Nana, are you okay?
An ambulance will be here soon.
It's okay. Don't worry. I won't leave your side.
I'm not going anywhere.
I think she's hyperventilating.
It's so painful you think you're dying,
but you will never die from it.
It's a living hell.
Hey, wait!
Nobu! Do you have a paper or plastic bag?!
Huh? Why?!
Just hurry and find one!
Hey, Hachi.
Humans are such pathetic creatures.
The harder they struggle, the deeper they sink.
If I were to be born again, I wanna be a fish.
Ren and I, just the two of us would swim in a small fish tank.
I reached into the sky
But I couldn't reach what I wanted
They grew smaller and disappeared into the sky
Like colorful balloons
I'm alone
My hand had no place to go
And gently you took it
Starless night
I won't look back at the shadow of my past
I want to feel your warmth
Tears are falling down
Even if I'm unsure I won't let go
Of your hand holding mine
