Do you want to die!?
Yow-ow-ow-ow-ow!
Wait!
Don't forget that your opponent wants to kill you!
I know, Piccolo- san...
Nyah-nyah!
Is that all the jumping power you've got?
You're even softer than your father.
Well now, shall I finally put you out of your misery?
Die, Kakarrot!!
S- stop picking on...
That little brat!
Wake up... Kakarrot...
Wake up... Kakarrot...
What are you doing over there?
Wake up...
Wake up... Kakarrot...
You little brat! What the hell has gotten into you!?
Damn!
Why, you-!
You dirty brat!
What's the matter?
Nowhere left to go!
H- his tail!
That's it, all right...
It was half a year ago that I pulled it out.
And now it has grown back.
Which means... it can't be!
How can this be?
You little brat!
Die!!
Wha-?
What!?
A- at this rate, I'm done for!
Begone!
What!?
What's up with that moon!?
Cheers!
My, my, we've finally gotten them together.
Now we'll be able to bring Goku back to life.
We can take a breather now, too.
Now all we have to do is wait for those infernal Saiyans.
You say that, but originally,
when Goku was a baby, he was a Saiyan too,
who was sent here from Planet Vegeta in one of those round vehicles, right?
N- no he wasn't! That might be the way he was born...
Er, of course he was.
What's the matter?
The moon is out.
Oh, you're right.
It's been a while, huh?
Something about that moon...
Don't get too carried away, you dirty brat!
T- that's Saiyan blood you've got, all right.
The power l've got right now won't do any good against the Saiyans.
Let go of me!
Dammit!
Damn...
Dammit! At this rate, the earth is going to be destroyed by that brat!
W- what's that?
Wake up... Kakarrot...
Wake up... Kakarrot...
So that's it.
The thing that's behind that moon...
It's all over now!
Sorry about that.
I'm going to make sure that I draw out those dormant abilities of yours.
Geez, you sure are a lot of trouble.
A tail!
Hooray! I'm there!
Huh?
There ain't anything here.
You've got to be kidding me.
What's that?
He's there! That's where Kaio- sama is!
This is it, all right. There's his house.
What!? What!?
What's wrong with the ground?
Dammit!
Incredible... It's like I'm being sucked in by some outrageous power!
I- it's no use! It feels like my body is as heavy as lead! Dammit!
I've finally... reached... here...
and I'm going... to meet Kaio- sama... no matter what!
A little farther... a little farther...
But before that, let's find me something to eat.
K- Kaio- sama? Are you Kaio- sama?
Despite how he looks, l'm sure he must be incredible.
G- good day. I'm Son Goku. I ask that you train me.
Kaio- sama, before we do, can I ask you for an apple?
Wow, Kaio- sama, impressive! You climbed up there easily!
Kaio- sama, sorry, but pick me another one. I'll catch it this time.
All right, whenever you're ready!
I caught it! I caught it!
Kaio- sama, teach me martial arts, okay- I mean, please?
Is that training?
You're saying I should move like that, right?
This is definitely hard...
K- Kaio- sama, what's the matter with the ground here?
What are you doing?
ls this curious man the real Kaio-sama?
When does Goku's training begin?
