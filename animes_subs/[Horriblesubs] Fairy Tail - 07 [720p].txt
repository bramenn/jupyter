The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Oh, yeah! Can you hear this voice?
Oh, yeah! It's hoarse from yelling.
Oh, yeah! Until your heart can hear it...
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
The moon and sun high-five.
Are you sure you're not forgetting something?
When you're not here to make me laugh,
even what I'm looking for can't be found.
Snowing, be honest with yourself and smile,
because when two people lay close, time overlaps.
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Don't say goodbye!
Last time on Fairy Tail!
I knew you'd come, you Fairy Tail flies!
What are you after, you fiend?
What do you plan to do with the lullaby?
Titania Erza?
Circle Sword!
What's going on?
The station is surrounded by wind...
You fools cannot escape from here.
Oshibana station.
I said we don't know already... It's impossible!
There's no way we could dispel the magic wind wall!
Erza!
Gray? You're not with Natsu?
We split up.
And never mind that now!
Eisenwald's real objective is the town down the line from here!
What?
It's the place where the old men are having their regular meeting!
They plan on using the lullaby there!
So that's what you're planning?
But this station is surrounded by a magic wind wall.
Yeah, I saw it earlier.
You'll be mincemeat if you try and force yourself out.
I'm well aware of that...
Erza, your arm...
It's nothing.
But while we're sitting here, Erigor gets ever closer to where the Guild Masters are.
Oh, yes... There should be someone they call Kage in Eisenwald.
He was the only one who was able to dispel Lullaby's seal.
Dispel?
He's a Dispeller?
Then he could dispel the magic wind wall, too!
Search for Kage and capture him!
Right!
Karacka, how long are you going to hide yourself there?
S-Sorry...
They're after Kage.
Get going.
Please, not me! I'm useless as backup in a fight.
No, I have a much simpler task for you.
Flame and Wind!
I've completely lost sight of him.
Aye!
Hey, why don't we head back to where Erza is for now?
What's with that reaction?
Erza told us to go after him.
I see...
You're so brave, Lucy... You'd ignore an order from Erza?
When Erza orders something, well...
After the things she'll do to you, Lucy, I'm not sure I could look at you...
She's going to do things to me?!
Fine, I get it!
I'll keep looking until I find him!
Your attitude sure changes easily, Lucy.
Enough out of you!
And why is this cat even following me anyway?
Erigor, where are you hiding?!
Next!
Has this guy never heard of a door?
Damn it...
Well, I suppose there's no problem if I just leave him alone.
But I wouldn't be satisfied with that, would I?
Thanks for earlier, you motion-sickness fly!
You again?
That looks good on you.
Shut up, baldy!
I'm not bald, and my name's not Hage! It's Kageyama!
That so?
Well, whatever.
I basically understand your magic now.
You ingest flames to increase your destructive power.
That's quite rare magic.
I really really want to slug you one right now, but it's not the time for that!
Where is Erigor?
Good question. Maybe I'll tell you if you beat me.
Knuckle Shadow!
Oh? You'll tell me after I hit you?
Then that's two birds with one stone!
I'm all fired up now.
What's that vibration?
He's a slippery one.
However...
You can't dodge my Orochi Shadow!
They'll follow you into the depths of hell!
I'll tear you apart!
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
Y-You've got to be kidding me?
He destroyed the Orochi Shadow with a single attack?
What destructive power...
I can't believe a wizard like this exists!
How'd you like another one of my fly punches, eh?
H-He's a monster!
What?
Natsu!
Oh my, it seems I've gone and destroyed the place again.
Why does it always end up like this?
Well, I feel better now.
I win, Decoyama.
It's Kageyama, damn it!
Okay! Tell me where Erigor is, like you promised!
Fool... Master Erigor is no longer in this station.
Huh?
Natsu!
That's enough! We need him!
Nice going, flamebrain!
Huh?
I didn't do nothin' but I'm sorry!
Dispel the magic wind wall, and don't give us any trouble!
She ain't kidding', man!
Erza's a beast!
Enough!
Got it?
Fine...
W-Why?
A simple task...
Kage!
Dispose of Kage!
Damn it! There goes our only exit!
Kage, stay with me! We need your power!
Seriously, man!
You're the only one who can dispel the magic wind wall!
Don't die!
Wasn't he... your ally?
Wasn't he an ally in the same guild as you?!
You bastard!
So that's what your guild is like?
Kage, you've got to stay with us!
It's no use, Erza, he's unconscious.
I can't let you die!
Dispel the wind wall!
Wait! He can't use magic in that sort of condition.
We must force him to do it!
Um...
Am I interrupting something?
Aye...
Clover Canyon.
A deep gorge that stretches all the way into the depths of the land.
There is no way to cross it other than this railway.
The town of Clover where the Guild Masters are assembled is near.
And I've recovered most of the magic power that I used creating that magic wind wall.
Let's fly.
You fools who took away our jobs and our rights... Just you wait!
The death god will purge you!
So Erigor's objective was the regular meeting?
The old man!
Erigor blocked the only route to Clover, and is heading there by air.
It'd be possible to catch up to him in a magic 4 wheeler,
but if we don't do something about this magic wind wall we can't leave the station!
But...
If we try and escape to the outside, that's what happens.
Kage, I'm begging you! Lend us your power!
Damn it!
I'll tear this wall to shreds!
Natsu!
Idiot. Force isn't going to help.
It'll be bad if we don't hurry!
Can't you freeze it with your magic?
If I could do that, I would have done it already.
Natsu!
Stop that already! You're going to smash yourself to pieces!
Damn it! What should we do?
I said, stop it!
Damn...
W-What?
That's it! Spirits!
I was able to transport between places by going through the Spirit world at the Everlue mansion, remember?
Well, a normal person would die if they did that.
You can't breathe.
And anyway, the gate can only open where the Celestial wizard is.
Huh?
In other words, if you wanted to pass through the spirit world to escape,
the least you'd need is a Celestial wizard outside the station.
You lost me there...
Just hurry up and do it.
I told you, I can't!
And it's also a really big violation of the contract for a human to enter the Spirit World.
It's sure a good thing that it was Everlue's key when it happened last time.
Yup. I don't get it.
Everlue's... key?
Lucy, I remembered!
Remembered what?
The thing I was talking about when we came here!
You mean when you kept calling me weird?
Here!
That's Virgo's key!
You can't just go stealing things!
But Virgo herself said to give it to you!
Sheesh. We don't have time to waste on this pointless crap.
Virgo?
You mean that maid guerrilla?
She said that since Everlue was arrested, his contract was broken.
So she visited us and said she wanted to contract with you, Lucy.
Oh, so she showed up?
I should be happy, but this isn't really the time, you know?
We've got to think of a way out of here.
But...
Shut up, you!
Little kitties should sit there quietly and meow!
She can be pretty scary sometimes.
She's way stronger than you'd think!
But, Virgo can dig holes in the ground.
I was thinking we could escape from the magic wind wall by digging underneath it...
W-What?
Seriously?!
Uh...
I see!
Way to go, Happy!
Why didn't you say something earlier?
Because you were pinching me.
Begging for Forgiveness
I'm sorry! So sorry!
I'll give you a reward later, I will! Please allow me to!
Anyway, just give me the key!
Okay! Looking forward to that reward!
I am linked to the path to the world of Celestial Spirits!
Now! O Spirit, answer my call and pass through the Gate!
Gate of the Maiden, I open thee!
Virgo!
You called, Master?
Who are you?
You called, Master?
Who are you?
Hey Marco, you really slimmed down.
My name is Virgo.
I apologize for the trouble I caused you earlier.
Slimmed down? More like a different person!
A different person?
Uh... What's with that appearance?
I am a Celestial Spirit that is faithful to her master.
I perform my duties in the appearance my master wishes.
You seemed a lot more powerful and forceful before, though.
Is that so?
In that case...
I shall return to this form.
Why'd you have to go and say that?
I prefer the slim version!
Understood.
Anyway, we don't have any time.
Can we postpone the contract until later?
Understood, Master.
Stop calling me Master already, would you?
Then shall I call you Queen?
Rejected!
Then, Princess?
Hmm, that might be nice...
So that's her thing, huh?
Anyway, hurry up.
Then I will proceed.
Ooh, she's digging!
Good going, Lucy!
Ouch!
Okay everyone, into that hole!
What are you doing, Natsu?
Havin' him die after I fought with him'll leave a bad taste in my mouth.
And so...
We're out!
Hurry onward!
Wow, what wind!
Princess!
Your underwear can be seen!
How about worrying about yourself?
Whoa there...
It's no use...
You'll never be able to catch up now.
We... win...
Where's Natsu?
Happy's not here, either.
That's the town...
Just you wait, you old geezers!
How do you like Happy's max speed?!
Happy!
I can't fly anymore...
Thanks to you I was able to catch up to him.
D-Damn you...
You're from Fairy Tail. Why are you here?
To defeat you, you blowhard!
Why? Why did you take me with you?
The city was deserted.
So we're gonna take you to a doctor in Clover.
You should be grateful.
No... I mean, why did you save me?
I'm your enemy!
Oh, I get it.
You plan on using me as a human bargaining chip with Erigor.
It will never work. He's as cold blooded as they come.
He wouldn't do a thing for me.
Whoa, dark.
If you want to die, just say the word.
Hey, Gray!
Everything doesn't have to be decided by life and death, you know.
Think about the future a little, will you?
All of you lot.
Erza?
Sorry about that, everything's fine.
Sorry!
Don't shove your big ass in my face!
That's sexual harassment! Gray, kill him!
Hey, don't make light of my words of wisdom!
My vision is getting cloudy.
It seems I truly have used up too much magic power.
Natsu, please stop Erigor!
It's up to you until we get there!
Bring it! I'll incinerate that dangerous flute!
You broke out from the magic wind wall?
What pests you flies are.
Let me through. Begone.
This ain't...
What?
He jumps and punches with flames?
And such force! I'd never think a wizard could punch like that!
Damn you!
Stop flutterin' around up there, it ain't fair!
Get down here and fight like a man!
Don't get cocky, fly!
Storm Bringer!
Natsu!
It's no use, I don't have enough magic power.
Hmph. Flames can't help him fly!
Natsu!
C-Crap!
This doesn't look good!
What should I do...
P-Pops?
You're useless, man.
Take a good look.
See?
Whoa, awesome.
It's called a Purple Flare.
It can do lots of things other than just burning stuff.
But mine just burns everything.
You can change the properties of the fire.
If you wish it from your heart, the fire will respond naturally to your will.
And if you do that then fire won't lose to water or wind...
I don't get it.
Natsu!
That was close.
Change the properties of the fire, huh?
I did it, Macao!
What the heck was that?
You must be cold being all naked like that.
How about I warm you up?
I don't see you wearing a parka, either!
I'll blow you away!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Storm Wall!
What is this guy?
He just attacks at random!
So this is what a Fairy Tail wizard is like?
It seems I underestimated your power a bit.
How about we get serious now?
Both of us...
I'm gettin' fired up!
Storm Mail!
Here I come!
What's the matter?
That all you got?
Damn it! Now you've gone and wrapped yourself in something annoying!
I'll tear it to shreds!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
What happened?
The flame disappeared!
As I thought... Without wrapping yourself in those flames, you don't have that destructive power.
Looks like it's no longer effective.
The Storm Mail's winds constantly blow outward.
Don't you get it?
Flames can stand up to a headwind!
Say what?
Flames can never defeat wind!
Take me away to someplace!
Let's ride on a tin horse, just the two of us.
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
It's sad that my beloved doll can't talk to me...
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
Every time I think of you tears start to flow...
I'm a crybaby, aren't I?
In the moon (the moon) at night (at night)
I'm always (I'm always)
searching for the rabbit!
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
so much it's like I'm under a spell.
This love is a monologue
from which I'll never awaken.
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
since I've completely fallen in love.
I wonder what spell I could chant,
to get through to you?
The perfect thing to say.
Spouting this and that,
I just love you like crazy!
One day I want to be able to tell you
You got me.
My words of thanks.
There's nothing more to say!
Erza, Natsu, Gray, and me!
Don't you think we balance each other out nicely?
True. Feels to me like the best team in all of Fairy Tail.
I know! Don't you think?
Now we'll just do a bunch of jobs, and I'll be famous in no time!
Next time: The Strongest Team!
Then the only question is how many cities this team will destroy... 2, maybe 3?
Maybe 4 or 5?
Give me a break here!
