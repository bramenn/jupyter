Hey all you viewers out there!
When you're watching Fairy Tail keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen, all right?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
You betrayed the master.
We were fighting on Galuna Island against Lyon and his gang who were scheming to resurrect Deliora,
but the great Erza came after us!
The great?
Natsu barged into the moon temple by himself and challenged Lyon.
Will he be okay?
That's right, we can do it!
Let's go for even more who-knows-what!!
The door to mystery is right in front of us
The whole world's a wonderland
which we're already wondering!!!
This excitement gets my heart racing
It's wonderful!
Who am I, I wonder?
What is real, I wonder?
Why can't I see tomorrow, I wonder?
The only part leveling up is my curiosity
We can't just throw away our daily life together, right?
Tell me! S. O. W.
Living itself will be our training!
So, we can make it!
Let's search for even more who-knows-what!
We can't be satisfied with just the normal answers
This magical wonder life
Our future is wondering!!!
We'll do our best living our life
the way we want to!
Let's wondering!!!
Ul is still alive.
What do you mean?
Ten years ago...
The city where I lived was attacked by Deliora.
It didn't even take a day for it to be destroyed.
Deliora...
I'd heard the rumors, but I'd have never imagined...
Lyon, come over here! We've got a survivor!
Hey, are you okay?
I was saved by Ul and Lyon who just happened to pass by.
Deliora... I won't forgive you...
Deliora... One day I'll...
And for me, that's how it all started.
Eternal Magic!
Gray, sure you can keep up?
My training is harsh, you know.
Yeah! I'll do anything!
As long as I can get the power to defeat Deliora, I'll do anything!
Sheesh...
Okay then, let's start.
Sure! I'm ready for you anytime!
What are you doing?!
Off with the clothes, now.
You've got to be kidding me!
You think I'd strip in this snow?
Isn't that right, Lyon?
Not you too!
Just hurry up and strip.
You want power, right?
Fine, I got it already!
I'll strip! All I gotta do is strip, right?
That'll do.
If you're going to control the cold, then you need to become one with the cold.
Everything starts from there.
I'm t-totally used it already.
Time to run, boys!
Hey, teach us magic!
Stop complaining and start running!
See? I'm doing the basics, too.
Listen up.
Among the many magics, Creation Magic is the magic with the greatest freedom...
Each individual's Creation Magic is unique.
Devote yourself.
And search out your own form...
Hey, don't you have an extra pupil there?
His name's Gray.
He's a rebel and quite the handful.
And the other one is named Lyon, right?
Both of them seem like they'll be future hunks.
You think?
Hey... When they grow up, let me have one,'kay?
Take both of'em.
Their constant noise is driving me nuts.
You look like you've got children, so no man'll come near you.
I don't need any love advice, thanks.
You're not getting any younger, Ul...
Shouldn't you be thinking about your own happiness a bit?
Yeah, yeah...
Say, Gray.
How long do you think until we get better than Ul?
I don't care.
Ul's my goal! My dream is to beat her one day.
If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, I don't care.
You're so dark.
And you're too cheerful and keep blabbing on about Ul all the time.
She told me that the reason she accepted you as her pupil was that you were wrapped in darkness.
After seeing what I saw, how could I be not be?
She said she wanted to drive away the darkness.
I'll do that myself... By my own hands...
As long... As long as I defeat Deliora, that's good enough for me.
The minute I get the power, I'll say sayonara to that ice queen!
What did you call your teacher?!
Sorry...
When are you gonna teach me some powerful magic?
I already did.
How is Creation Magic strong?
It's no use at all.
Look here.
Gray!
I told you, remember?
Creation Magic is the magic with the greatest freedom.
When you find your own form, it can be as powerful as you want.
You're just saying the same old stuff.
Why are you stripping here?
It's all your fault I have this weird habit!
It's my fault?!
L-Let's go home.
'Kay...
Wow, that was embarrassing.
Hilarious...
Shut up, pointy-eyes.
You shut up, droopy-eyes.
So, did you hear about Deliora?
They say it's moved to the Northern Continent.
Somewhere around Brago, I hear.
Seriously?
Then peace has returned to Isvan?
Gray?
Deliora is... at Brago?
Stop this!
There's no way you can win against Deliora!
It's impossible for you, Gray.
Shut up.
You think you can understand?
I'm going to avenge my mother and father!
You got a problem with that?!
You leave, and you're expelled.
Sure! Sounds good to me!
Gray...
If I die, then I'll haunt you for not teaching me more powerful magic.
Damn it...
Huh?
The ruins are... tilted?
What happened?
Natsu, I bet.
Yeah.
Not sure how he did it, but only he would do something nuts like that.
It doesn't really matter whether he did it on purpose or not.
Now the light of the moon won't shine on Deliora.
Who knew that his tendency for wanton destruction could actually come in handy?
I knew. It was foreshadowed.
Watch out!
Who's there?!
We've found you, Fairy Tail!
We won't allow you to interfere with Reitei-sama!
These guys...
Lyon's followers?
We're surrounded!
Aye!
Leave them to me!
Erza...
Go, Gray.
Finish things with Lyon.
Don't worry! We're here, too, so just go!
Aye!
You guys...
He doesn't know that Ul is still alive.
The only one who can stop him...
Ice Make Rose Garden!
Damn... I didn't think it'd be this strong...
It'll be fine.
Everything'll be fine now.
Why?
No questions. Just take Lyon away from here.
It's harder to fight when I have to protect you, too.
Lyon...
He's out for the count.
Deliora...
I wasn't... able to do anything...
Hurry and go.
Ul, why did you come?
I thought I was expelled?
A good friend of mine told me that I should start thinking about my own happiness.
But I don't remember being all that unhappy.
Isn't that right?
With my two bright pupils growing day by day... Every day an adventure...
That's all the happiness I need.
I came here to take back that happiness.
Ul, your leg...
Oh this? I lost it, but it's no big deal.
Creation Magic is pretty amazing, don't you think?
If that monster is your darkness, then I have a reason to fight it.
Go. I'll defeat it.
Don't... I won't let you!
This is all my fault!
It's no one's fault.
This is just a hurdle to pass to take back my happiness.
You're awake, Lyon?
You and Gray-
You're really going to do it?
Happiness? What are you talking about?
Lyon...
Shut up!
Ul, you're the strongest wizard there is...
There's no way you'd lose to some monster, right?
Lyon, I've told you before.
There's always someone better.
That can't be true...
There are a ton of wizards stronger than me in the countries to the west.
That's not true...
You're the strongest, Ul...
If you're not then... why'd I go through all that training?
After you surpass me, then you should just find a new goal.
I became your pupil because I thought you were the strongest!
Don't you dare lose to that monster!
Don't betray me!
Lyon...
If you're not gonna be serious, then I'll do it!
That pose... Where did you learn that?
Where, you ask?
Because you wouldn't teach me any powerful magic, I had to read the spell books in your storehouse!
Why'd you hide such powerful magic from me?
Iced Shell!
Lyon! Did you read that book to the end?
The people who use that magic...
Iced Shell?
Are you listening, Lyon?
What incredible magical power!
It noticed us!
No magic will work against Deliora...
In that case, I'll use this magic to trap you for eternity in ice!
I can't let you use that magic.
Ul, why did you...
He can't use Iced Shell!
The people who use it destroy their own bodies.
But it's true that's the only thing that could stop this thing.
I can't believe that Lyon would think of trying the same thing I was going to do.
Was trying to do...?
That's a disciple for you.
Ul!
Stand back.
I won't allow you to get near my pupils!
This is the end for you, monster!
Ultimate Freeze...
Iced Shell!
Ul!
Your body!
I told you, right?
This magic destroys the body.
It's magic that turns one's own body into ice...
Gray, I have a favor to ask you.
Tell Lyon I died.
If he knew that I became the ice, he'd probably spend his entire life trying to undo the spell.
If he did that, that would defeat the purpose.
Stop it!
I want Lyon to see more of the world...
And you too, Gray...
I'm begging you, stop! Please, I'll do whatever you say from now on!
Don't be sad.
I'll live on.
I'll live on as the ice, for all eternity...
Go forth... to your future...
Ul!
I will seal your darkness.
Ul gave her life to drive away my days of darkness.
Go forth... to your future...
With those words in my heart, I decided to start on a new path.
However...
Damn that Ul...
Deliora is...
Iced Shell, right? Ul did it?
Gray!
S-She's dead.
You're lying...
You're lying!
You bastard!
What about my dream?!
How am I supposed to surpass Ul now?!
Eh?!
Sorry...
Sorry?! Screw you!
If it weren't for you...
If you hadn't challenged Deliora...
This is your fault, Gray.
You killed Ul.
Damn, there's no end to this.
Just give it up and surrender already, you pointy-eyed bastard!
Your eyes are pretty pointy themselves.
Time to finish this.
I like the sound of that.
What's this?
Gray?
Natsu, let me take this guy down.
You already lost to him once, remember?
I won't this time.
I'll finish this.
That's some confidence you have there.
It was my fault that Ul died ten years ago.
But...
Hurting my friends... Hurting the village...
Trying to melt that ice... I can't forgive you for that.
I'll punish you for them all, Lyon.
That pose...
Iced Shell!
Iced Shell?
Ul cast the Iced Shell magic on this demon.
It's a demon that Ul risked her life to seal away.
Didn't you hear? Ul is already dead!
You bastard... have you gone mad?
Return the villagers to the way they were,
take your friends and leave this island immediately!
This is the last chance I will give you.
I see... You think you can bluff me with that magic?
How pointless.
I'm serious.
Why, you...
Gray!
No matter how many years pass, it won't change the fact that it's my fault Ul's dead!
I have to take responsibility sometime...
So now's the time.
I'm prepared to die...
I've been for the past 10 years!
You're serious?!
Answer me, Lyon!
Do we die together or live together?
Do it.
You don't have the guts to die.
There's no way you do!
Too bad.
Gray!
Natsu, Erza, everyone at Fairy Tail...
It's up to you now...
Sorry, but I'm making my exit!
This is... the end!
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
chasing after your profile left only in my revolving dreams
You said, I never want to see your face again, when you left me
But the tears on your cheek said it all
Every time you felt like you'd be swallowed up in the waves of contradiction
you always held back your tears, you know?
What a strong person, they said, but everyone overestimated you
and before you knew it you lost sight of who you really are
Then the sun I thought would always be near me collapsed
and the light shut off...
Rubbing out the truths and the lies of one day, altogether
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
still, ironically, chasing after your profile in my revolving dreams
Professor Happy's Fairy Tail Lectures!
Today we'll be teaching you the secrets of the Ice Wizard, Gray!
Gray uses Ice Creation Magic, and is always fighting with the fire-using Natsu.
But they're actually quite similar.
Gray gets lots of points for stripping off pretty much any clothing anywhere.
He seems to have a weakness for women's tears, though.
Until next time!
Stand, Bow, Aye!
You and Gray have always fought, right?
Well I'm not gonna lose to him, that's for sure!
Which one of you is stronger?
I'm way stronger than that icey bastard, obviously.
Gray said pretty much the same thing.
Next time: Galuna Island, the Final Battle!
So, who do you think is stronger, Happy?
Anyway, it looks like Deliora is about to be resurrected!
You're just trying to dodge the question! Right...?
