H!
O?!
I do fall in love!
I just realised it for the first time
That I had fallen in love
Twenty-four hours a day thinking of you, you and nothing more than you!
It's something I wasn't consciously aware of
Somehow ( somehow) I'm feeling different from the usual
With you ( the two of us) and our dull chatter
Don't tell me ( mutual love?) Nope, it's a one-sided crush
This is bad! Our gazes met!
What, what? Why is my heart pounding like this?
Did a short circuit just make a mess out of my mind?
This is my first time... feeling like this...
I wonder if I have a fever
Suddenly and precipitately, love has arrived.
Instantly igniting my face into a bright red
T-That's stupid?! My hands are shaking
Is this really what they call love?
I-I did it! A conversation filled with stutters
This awkward silence... *mumble mumble*
Your... ( Your...) I want to know your feelings.
O-One-sided love
First love! The usual way to school
The shining light. I do fall in love!
I feel I could fly towards the sky
O-One-sided love

H H!
Woke up in the morning, brushed my teeth
In the blink of an eye, it's 10pm
Today, we laughed a whole lot
We had a great time
At times, with my friends, acting like fools, being noisy
Fluttering, our eyes met.
It's a coincidence, right?
I wouldn't call this my first love
It's not my character.
Say, will we be able to meet again tomorrow?
As my eyelids close
I see you sparkling all over the place
Today was fun, too, wasn't it?
I'm in love
So happy, so happy
It is my pleasure to meet you, my new-found love.
Surely, we'll meet again tomorrow
Have a good night
We'll meet immediately in our dreams
So have a good night

Hey, hey, Mio-chan.
What is it?
I've been wondering about this for a while now,
but why do you always wear that hair pin?
Ah, this?
Hmm... somehow...
Somehow?
Somehow means somehow.
I forgot to bring my maths notebook with me.
Huh?
Do we have maths today?
We do.
We also had homework, remember?
I'll go and get it.
Go ahead without me.
Ah well.
I didn't do it anyway, so it won't make any difference.
Ah, Mai-chan!
Selamat pagi!
Here it is!
Here it is!
Here it is, Mai-sensei!
Could it be that you're holding back on a killer greeting?
As expected, it's big.
Yes. As big as a mountain... as big as a mountain!
Is it really as big as a mountain?
Well... it's not really a mountain, is it?
I get it.
I get why you're angry.
It's because I took that piece of broccoli from your lunch box yesterday, right?
Which is why... I bought you broccoli!
When I was eating your broccoli, I realised that you're fond of it.
Since then, I've been wondering... have I done something bad?
Therefore, I give this to you!
You know, my dad was telling me...
It's not the broccoli.
Nor... the cauliflower.
I screwed up so much that I can't figure what she's angry about...
But I get the general idea.
I don't want her to stay angry like this...
Now that it has come to this, all I can do is honestly apologise to her...
Mai-chan!
Sorry for taking your steak yesterday!
Sorry for taking your bunny!
Sorry for eating your rice!
Sorry for leaving the black soy beans!
What?
Why is she so angry?
I don't get it any more!
It's not because of yesterday's lunch?
Ah! Then could it be something from even earlier?
Is it because I broke the neck of the Maitreya...
Or is it because I took it away without asking?!
Or is it because I secretly buried it in the ground?!
Or is it because I changed my mind and tried offering it on Mai-chan's desk?!
Or is it because I changed my mind again and burned it in the incinerator?
Mai-chan!
So... so you were just listening to music!
No wonder you didn't notice.
I didn't know about it and kept on chatting on my own.
That was dangerous!
Everything was on the verge of being exposed.
The second half.
It's the first time I heard the second half...
Ah, Tanaka-kun!
Sorry, do you have a moment?
Ah, hm, I-I was thinking...
that hairstyle of yours is morally... a little...
Sensei.
Yes?!
Do you want to eat a dorayaki?
Oh no!
I completely forgot about this printout!
There are still five minutes left until maths.
I had Mio-chan show it to me yesterday...
This is the request of my life!
I can't ask her!
At this rate, I'll have to...
Mai-chan.
This is embarrassing,
I sorta forgot about the maths homework...
Um, if it's okay with you, I'd like to see your notes for a sec...
Here.
My, thanks!
Thank you.
Wait a sec, okay?
I'll copy it at Mach speed.
This is bad.
I'm really late.
This is bad.
This is bad.
You idiot!
You're so noisy in the morning, Masao!
This is really bad!
I'm really late!
I'm restructuring here!
This is strange.
Mai-chan, um, this doesn't really look like the maths printout...
I'll treat you to juice!
Here.
Thanks!
I'm late for school.
And dad is restructuring.
We're both in trouble.
Now's not the time for this!
Wait, isn't Masao in danger here?!
What's going to happen to Masao?!
No, wait...
Now is not the time for this either!
I'm in a pinch here!
The printout, Mai-chan!
Now that it's come to this,
I'll also treat you to that from the store at the station!
Here.
T-Thanks!
T-This, this.
It's this.
See, you do have it.
You should've just given it to me earlier, Mai-chan, you sneaky one.
Let's quickly copy this stuff then.
Just how old is this printout of mine?
I want to go to New Orleans.
Well then, who knows how to do this question?
No one?
Hakagi's class is always hard.
I'm confused, now that I've forgotten to do the homework.
And he'll be mad if I get the question wrong.
I'm saying this now,
but anyone who's not up for it will lose their good standing.
So it's come to this?
Under that threat, I can't allow myself to... fail!
Hmm, then who should I pick?
Today's the 23rd, so I'll go with attendance number 23... Nakanojou!
Now's the time!
Oh, he's absent?
What?!
My hand is cramped...
Why is my hand cramped right now...
Well, it's May, so attendance number 5 will...
This is bad... at this rate, he will see me...
I just called on him...
For the time being, I'll get into his blind spot... blind spot...
I'll call on someone new...
Blind -
The chair... the sound of the chair will...!
What is that sound? What the -
Hey, someone's mobile phone is ringing!
It's a ghost ringtone!
It's the final act.
You saw it.
And so the smiles of everyone in the class bloomed!
Right?
Well then, this question...
Aioi.
First comes rock, next comes paper, rockscispaper doesn't count,
rock paper scissors!
Come forth!
Chubabababa... bang!
Hmm... I bought both the sugar and the milk...
The eggs were really cheap, right?
Yeah, I stocked up on some as well.
Oh no!
The eggs are on sale today!
What should I do?
I can still make it.
I really should go back to the store.
It's a black cat!
So... so cute!
Oh... I can't bring you home; the Professor's there.
I'm sorry.
I have returned.
That cat!
I caught him!
You can't just bring him back like that.
But he's cute.
Well, that's true...
I mean, no, that's not the point!
He's not cute?
No, he is cute.
He's cute, but...
Hmm... If you get an animal, you have to take care of it.
Can you do that, Professor?
I can!
I won't do anything, okay?
Since you also have to clean the toilet...
Nano's not going to do anything?
Well, then I won't let you pet him any more.
N-Not that!
You've got it all wrong, it's not like that...
Professor, Professor! I saw him, this ca -
I want to touch him!
It feels so fluffy!
Professor, that's not fair... me too, me too!
His belly is also very fluffy!
His flank is fluffy too!
His right paw is fluffy too!
His left paw is fluffy too!
His tail is fluffier.
The back of his ears is even fluffier than his tail.
But doesn't it feel better to touch his tail?
His tail isn't fluffy!
I wonder what's up with him?
I wonder if he's hurt somewhere?
*Shine!*
Hold on a moment.
Professor?
Nano, Nano, Nano!
I made a speech-giving scarf!
Professor, that's amazing! And fast!
Let's quickly try it on, Sakamoto.
Sakamoto?
That cat's name is Sakamoto?
Yep, it's also written on the box.
That's too simple.
All right, it's done!
I wonder if he'll talk?
He will.
I want to hear him!
I want to hear him!
No matter how you think about it,
you were petting me way too much before.
In general, when a cat meows, isn't it obvious that they're hungry?
Sorry, we didn't really know...
Also, the name.
Calling me Sakamoto just because it's written on the box is too feeble-minded!
Sorry...
See, I told you so.
But...
How old are you two?
Eight years old.
One year old.
I am, in human terms, 20 years old.
Sakamoto-san... I guess?
I guess...
Well, if I get free food from now on, then I'll be very grateful.
Don't ever forget to respect your elders.
And while I'm at it, let me also tell you this.
Just because I'm a cat,
it doesn't mean you guys can just pet me like that.
To put it clearly, I don't hate being petted.
But you know, cats have a...
I'll put him back where we found him.
Eh?!
W-Wha...
Sorry about that.
Here you go.
Are you sure about this?
I haven't even paid the rent,
but you're giving me food.
It's fine, really.
We should help each other out in tough times.
If there's anything else you need, please tell me.
Really?!
Well then, could you lend me some money?
Hey, you.
Just because I've been a little nice to you doesn't mean you can be a Tengu.
Sorry.
V-Vice Principal!
This is...
What's the misunderstanding, Principal?
Open and behold the contents of the torso.
If I win, you'll forget about the that from the store in front of the station, okay?
Okay?
Okay.
Yay, she's mine!
Match for one juice, ready...
Go!
Mai-chan, that was a little bit of a false start just now.
Right, Mio-chan?
I suppose she did start a little early.
Just by a bit.
Right, right?
Let's start again.
Okay, let's try this again.
Ready... go!
Mai-chan wins!
I guess I wasn't prepared.
I underestimated my opponent's strength.
With this, I'm warmed up.
All right, one more time!
Oh my, my hand sure is weak today.
Must be that all-nighter I pulled last night.
Anyway, both my body and soul are ready.
It's about time for the real show!
You ready for it?
Oh crap!
I wasn't paying attention!
However, I was caught unprepared three times in a row.
This is surprising. Surprising.
Yukko, isn't it about time -
Wait.
Just wait a second.
Huh, huh.
Yes, yes.
I see, I see.
Ah.
I can see it.
Beginner's luck can only take you so far, Mai-chan.
And here I come.
Ready...
Chest!
However, isn't this quite fun?
This... what is it again...
Yukko...
You called it arm wrestling?
Mio-chan, here.
Can you hold onto this for the time being?
It's been a while since I've been able to get serious.
Give me a break!
If you don't do it seriously, I can't either, okay?
Listen, next time we do it for real!
I'll bring out my killer move too!
Earth Dangerous!
Shooting Snake!
Death...!
Death...!
Dea -
What?
What is this?
I don't get it at all!
It's only arm wrestling... Why were you so passionate about it?
Or rather, I forgot that I needed to use the toilet.
I'm going there for a bit.
I thought the outcome was a bit weird...
Yukko.
That from the store in front of the station...
Aw man...
My arm was sore, so I didn't do my homework and got told off.
This is the worst.
Even so, Mai-chan... what happened to Masao in the end?!
What happened?
Okay, I get it.
I'll treat you to one more juice.
Here.
I don't get it.
Don't you just want to make some kind of joke?
What the hell is with the Kinase?!
Some kind of serenade?
Well then, the next Nichijou is the fourth one.
Look forward to it!
