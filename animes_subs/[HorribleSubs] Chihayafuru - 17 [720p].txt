Huh?
Mizusawa High School Athletic Festival
It's time for the main event in the
second half of the Mizusawa High School Athletic Festival!
The finals for the club relay!
We have six teams who won their way through the prelims,
including the favorite, the track team,
as well as the speedy baseball and soccer teams!
Our Nationals-bound tennis team
has also shown their ability to run!
You'll want to watch the basketball team
as they use a ball for their baton!
However, all eyes will be on the
Karuta Club
non-athletic Karuta club,
which has managed to sneak in to sixth!
the red that is the Tatsuta River
On your marks.
Set.
How can this be?!
The Karuta club had the best start!
They already have a considerable lead!
But the track team is also fast!
Taichi!
Their second runners take over at almost the exact same time!
Mashima-kun!
The second runner for the Karuta club is just as fast!
They're neck and neck with the track team!
What's this?
The basketball team and soccer team have dropped their batons!
The tennis team and baseball team are also having trouble!
Meanwhile, the track team and Karuta club
are on their third runners!
The cheers are deafening!
Hang in there, Karuta club!
Oh! But the fourth runner is falling behind!
The baseball team and soccer team have caught up!
And now each team turns to their anchor!
He's fast! Surprisingly fast!
Who said this team wasn't athletic?!
They're clearly athletes!
Oh, no!
The track team lost their baton!
Our favorite has fallen in the last leg!
Nobody could have seen this coming!
As our runners turn the final corner,
the baseball team and Karuta club are in the lead!
Can the Karuta club stage a comeback!
Will the baseball team hold onto its lead?!
Who will be our winner?!
Recruiting new members
Incredible! The Karuta club has won!
Chihaya Furu
Verse 17
World Offers No Escape
Nobody's coming...
We worked so hard to win.
To get everyone's attention...
Chihaya-chan, a girl shouldn't lie on the floor.
But...
Some people came to watch us play,
but they left because it looked too hard.
We came in first, but it was mostly luck.
I was slow.
What are you talking about?
You were fast!
Our summer training really helped!
You think so?
Hey, guys. We finished our research.
Looking at the tournaments near Tokyo,
we have the Saitama tournament in late September
and the Kawaguchi tournament in early October.
There's also the East Master/Queen qualifier
for Class A and higher players in late October.
The Eastern qualifier...
for deciding the East representative to challenge
the Queen next January.
The most important tournament every year.
Chihaya needs to play
more matches to get experience.
Nishida and I need to win a Class B tournament
so we can make Class A.
Okay!
Oe-san and Komano, you'll need some Class D wins,
so you can start moving up.
Then we should all focus on our individual g-
Oh, excuse me for a second.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, fine.
Let's break up.
Then we should all focus on our individual goals!
What?!
No luck with girls
Prez! What was that?!
No luck with guys
Didn't even bat an eye!
No luck with girls
It took him a second to dump her!
No luck with guys
I never knew you had a girlfriend!
Let's practice.
It was the girl who called him Ta-kun!
Arata...
Will Arata...
be in the Western qualifier?
people would always ask if I was pining for someone
After I determined...
I can make it in time!
In the sleepy...
Make Class A before October...
a whirlwind of flower petals descends
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Okay, let's take a ten minute break
before we get one more match in today.
The training we did over the summer
Mizusawa Fight!
was hard, but fun.
On!
Fight!
On!
Fight!
On!
Mizusawa!
Especially compared to last summer, when I spent
all my time studying alone.
But...
Even though I trained as hard as everyone else,
I'm still small and can't build muscle.
Kana-chan.
When you have time, you should do sit-ups
and back extensions at home.
Huh?
I noticed something
after watching all those matches at nationals.
When girls and thinner boys play Karuta,
they tend to sit back,
so you end up only using your upper body.
It's probably because your muscles aren't
strong enough to support your weight.
I've been training at home,
but it hasn't really helped.
Don't worry!
You just have to keep working at it!
I need to go to the restroom.
What is it, Desktomu-kun?
Oh, you're working hard on your swing.
I've been thinking.
I can't beat Chihaya-chan and the other
members at cards that are farther away,
but I can win the cards that are closer by bringing them in.
If I can move in a straight line
to the cards that are farther away,
I'll be in a position to take advantage
of my opponent's mistakes.
It won't matter if I'm not athletic enough.
After the athletic festival,
everyone was saying that Karuta was a sport,
but I consider Karuta an art.
Because men and women can compete against
each other in Karuta.
I won't let you beat me, Desktomu-kun.
This isn't happening!
I don't get Karuta at all!
I'm glad I chose to give Karuta a chance.
I can change.
I know it.
And not just physically or mentally...
Hey, is there a point to this exercise?
I'm not sure, but don't stop!
I need to hone my reflexes if I'm going
to put up a fight against the Queen, I think...
Too slow!
Straight to the card...
How can I learn to do what Shinobu-chan does?
Hey, I'm going to the tournament
in Kanazawa this weekend.
Wanna come along?
Huh? Kanazawa?
Wasn't it in Saitama?
The Saitama tournament is next weekend.
There's another tournament
before that one in Kanazawa, for Class A and B players.
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Is Kanazawa really far away?
How much will it cost?
It's 8,000 yen if you take a one-way, overnight bus.
Add in the participation fee, and it's around 20,000.
Well, I doubt anyone else can afford it.
I'll go by myself.
No fair!
That's no fair, Taichi!
I'll buy you a souvenir.
Lucky you. Kanazawa, huh?
That's near Fukui...
Mommy!
Don't look.
Impressive.
I hate myself for being so sneaky.
MISSING!
For trying to become better at Karuta before everyone else.
For trying to go on a trip with Chihaya.
Chihaya.
What?
I'm...
I'm going to make Class A.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Hmm?
Huh?
What?!
What are you doing, Nishida?!
What about you?!
You never said anything about this!
Over there! Keep it down!
There was someone else just as sneaky!
Why are you here?
A senpai from my Karuta society invited me,
so I have dibs.
Dibs? That's bull!
What about you?
Took a plane.
Stupid rich boy!
So you're trying to reach Class A first!
So are you!
No, I need to focus on my match.
Concentrate...
We will now begin memorization time.
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Win.
I have to win!
Like a boatsman adrift...
H-He's fast!
While autumn leaves crunch...
Since I could not hide...
Impassionate gods...
the red that is the Tatsuta River
Chihaya-chan has really improved.
Her match against the Queen must have helped.
You'll notice once you play against her.
She's much faster now.
Her opponents aren't even close on her sweet cards.
She can give the Queen a run for her money on those.
I still see her in my dreams.
I need to match her speed, her edge!
Impassioned vows exchanged over many a tear shed to last
when I should have gone to sleep instead
Oh! Oops!
Ow, that's a fault.
That's where the Impassionate card was before.
Chihaya-chan hasn't been able to cut down on her mistakes.
She's too concerned about the Impassion cards.
Thank you very much.
I was doing okay for a while,
but I ended up losing to you in the end, Hiroshi-san.
You may be fast, Chihaya-chan,
but you don't scare me.
Huh?
Chihaya-chan, stop taking cards with your speed.
The 1st Career Survey First Choice Second Choice
Queen
The survey is due on Thursday.
We have materials in the career guidance office, so drop by.
This is your own future, so think very carefully!
Yes, ma'am!
Kana-chan, you'll be going
to a university that has classical literature, right?
Oe Traditional Clothing
I know what I want to major in,
but I'm not sure which university I want to go to.
Is Chihaya-chan acting like that because of the survey?
Beats me...
What's wrong with them?
Beats me...
Brutal...
Qualifying for Class A is brutal!
Ayase! Get out of the corner and play me!
Hey! That's no fair!
I have to play strong opponents to get better!
Come on! Let's play!
Uh-huh...
Huh?
What's wrong, Chihaya?
Did something happen?
Chihaya-chan?
Chihaya-chan, stop taking cards with your speed.
Huh?
What do you mean, Dr. Harada?
I can't win without my speed.
Chihaya-chan, what did you think about the Queen's Karuta?
She was super fast!
I couldn't believe how fast she was!
Anything else?
She was accurate!
Like she was always aiming for a certain spot on the card!
But she was still fast!
Every player wishes they could have her speed...
You don't have to be fast.
Chihaya-chan, how many sweet cards do you have?
Five? Ten?
It doesn't matter if you can take a few cards really fast.
If you lose all of the other cards, you lose the match.
Stop concentrating on speed.
Huh?
That's what Dr. Harada said?
What does Ayase have, if you take away her speed?
She doesn't use any strategy.
So your sharp senses are actually hurting you.
Hey, Chihaya.
Is she actually trying to think this through?
Usually, when she runs into a difficult problem,
she gives up within ten seconds!
I look too.
I don't get it.
Why shouldn't I take cards fast?
What is he talking about?
The next round is Nishida vs. Mashima
and Ayase vs. me, right?
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Impassionate gods...
That's the problem!
He's talking about how you move too fast!
Oh, he means this?
Seriously, none of the
other Impassion cards have been read yet.
My body kinda moves by itself...
Primal instinct.
Are you finished?
I'm going to read the next card.
the red that is the Tatsuta River
In order to restore my faith...
My own sleeves are like...
Look for the sound...
A 15-card win! Good!
Today, there were 6 B cards, 10 C cards.
And 0 A and D cards.
What's that?
The distribution of the cards I've won against you
over the course of the 28 matches
Vs. Ayase Ayase Komano 1) The Impassionate card in my right middle row is taken by Ayase. She sends The sound of people from her right lower row to my right lower row. 2) I take In order to from her right middle row. In order for is on my side and Ayase was focused on taking that card from me. I send I feel as from my right middle side to her right middle side.
we played in August and September.
One percent of the cards I take come from region A on the opponent's side.
Sixty-seven percent come from region B on the opponent side.
Thirty-two percent come from region C on my side.
Zero percent come from region D on my side.
What?!
You've been keeping track of all that?!
That means I win almost all of the cards in A and D!
But that also means that
I'm able to take a considerable
number of cards from B and C.
I can't take any one-syllable cards from you,
but you have trouble with three-syllable cards.
So I would place them in C, where you are weak,
and constantly attack your left side.
I'm sure you come up against people
who use these strategies.
Hey, what about me? Show me mine!
Not for nothing.
You hog!
It doesn't matter if you can take a few cards really fast.
If you lose all of the other cards, you lose the match.
Chihaya-chan, you commit a lot of faults.
Huh?
You gamble because you want to take a card faster.
For example, take May the time spent and May the time we.
Oh, a lot of people have trouble with those.
Since the poems are also similar!
Silence!
May the time we is 19.
May the time spent is 88.
They're separated by two hundred years of history!
Years?!
May the time we spend apart from one another be
as short-lived as the reeds of Naniwa Bay
May the time spent in our one night together
bring a life of everlasting love
Both poems were written by women,
and they describe similar situations.
I find it moving that
two women separated by 200 years
would express themselves in similar ways,
but that's not important right now.
Chihaya-chan.
You told me that the
Impassionate card looks bright red to you.
May the time we, from the 10th century,
refers to the withered green reeds of Naniwa Bay in winter.
May the time spent, from the 12th century,
refers to the new green reeds of Naniwa Bay in spring.
That's how I picture it.
Or you could say that
the Naniwa Bay in 88 had more prostitutes at the time,
so the card should be rich green.
Kana-chan...
You really love poetry.
In my mind, Karuta is about the meanings of the poems.
I was sad,
because, for me, Karuta was about speed.
Goodbye, Ms. Miyauchi.
Yes, goodbye.
What?
Ayase-san is in the library?
Do they keep manga in there?
Ayase-san, you haven't turned in your career survey yet.
Hurry up and...
Interpretation of Hundred Poets
Speed isn't enough.
I need to learn from Desktomu-kun.
I need to learn from Kana-chan.
