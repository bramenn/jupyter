Memorial Corner Aina Sakurai
Wow, this girl died.
A cute thing like her?
Hey, she was the same age as us.
Poor thing!
That's so lame, I hate those Dorssians...
Rest in peace, Aina-chan.
Rest in peace.
Rest in peace.
Rest in peace.
Just you watch, Nobu.
Next time, I'm gonna avenge you in that robot for sure.
I'll avenge you, you hear?
REST IN PEACE
Tokishima Haruto
L-elf Karlstein
I've worked out everyone's assignments.
Navigation, Gunnery, Communications, Radar, Engineering, Shields.
Are you sure you want to let me work up the battle station assignments?
I'm asking you to do it because I think that's the best way to minimize loss of life.
Aina Sakurai, huh?
I've decided to believe.
That you also have something precious to you.
It looks like the intervals between attacks are growing shorter...
I'm hungry.
Training Journal. Rion Nanami.
Module 77 is en route to the Moon which is neutral territory.
The students have begun military drills in order to prepare for battle.
The person who drew up the drill regimen was none other than L-elf, our country's first refugee.
I think the reason that the students have been so surprisingly quick to accept his instructions
is that they don't want to see anyone else die.
I myself am teaching first-aid procedures.
Though I hate the thought of any of my students being hurt...
I take some comfort in the fact that lessons are still being conducted in the classrooms.
Inuzuka, quit looking at those stock prices or whatever!
Intruder detected in the Pit!
I repeat, intruder detected in the Pit!
An enemy?
Our intruder was Yamada, huh?
This is the fifth time. When is he gonna learn?
I get it. He wants to use this to
He wants to use it to get revenge with his own two hands.
Pathetic.
Hang on.
Wanting to avenge a friend's death is pathetic?
These machines have a registration system.
Once one pilot uses it, it can't be changed over to another.
What about it?
If I gave in to emotion and let someone pilot it, and it turned out that he had no talent for it, what then?
Nothing is a bigger nuisance than the hopes of people who have no talent.
Will avenging someone's death bring them back to life?
Instead of that, you should think about how to prevent future losses.
War is something that should be conducted calmly and efficiently, like a machine.
Like a machine...
47 seconds.
46 seconds.
48 seconds.
44 seconds.
Is he okay?
Is he okay?
Haru
What're you doing here?
I was worried about him. What about you?
I'm worried, too.
I wonder if they were going out...
Him and Aina-chan?
They were joined at the hip.
He was always heading out to visit some girl from another school.
Oh.
Haruto. Say something to him.
This is too big to carry alone.
Why not you?
This has to be done guy to guy!
Yamada's at it again?
No. Yamada's supposed to be in solitary confinement.
A Dorssian fleet is closing in on us from behind!
The barrier system?
Already on it!
We won't let them hit us!
I'm widening mine!
What are those?
The barrier system seems to be working.
Way to go! You guys are great at this!
I can't believe he retrofitted the EM debris shield into a barrier system...
How long had he been planning it?
Calmly. Like a machine.
Calmly. Like a machine.
A systematic defense strategy...
L-elf is in command?
It's the Valvraves.
Fall back slowly.
Draw them both away from Module 77.
They're running?
My show's just getting started!
DORSSIA MILITARY 6 FLEET
Exactly as planned, sir.
The Valvraves are moving away to aft in pursuit of Captain Cain's fleet.
They're only students, after all.
I can't believe they fell for such an obvious diversion.
Wow, the Valvraves are so powerful...
They're our guardian angels.
Still, aren't they too powerful?
JIOR didn't have any weapon manufacturers, so how
Ration time!
Those look tasty!
Thanks.
I'm starved!
What's that?
Emergency rations.
You told me to make some, remember?
What did you do with the recipe I gave you?
It's better if they taste good, right?
These are a JIOR specialty, jellied bean paste called Youkan.
What counts is nutrition. Flavor doesn't
Here!
See? Nice and sweet, huh?
We've been making these forever!
E-Enemy vessels detected!
But Haruto and Saki chased
No, these are coming from up ahead!
It's not the same fleet as before!
They had another force out here?!
Where were they hiding?
Then we'll just have to defend against these, too!
But there's way more of them this time!
Quit your whining!
We don't need Haruto to defend ourselves!
The Module's being attacked?!
A different fleet moved in when you left!
You're saying we were lured away?
Miss Rukino let's head back!
If you want to go back, you'll have to go through us!
Enemy fleet now has us completely surrounded!
The Valvraves are pinned down!
You're some kind of war pro, aren't you?!
Do something!
What the? What happened?
A power outage?! Why now?!
Damn it!
Hey, what the hell is going on?!
Open the door! Open the door, damn it!
Now's my chance!
What is it? What caused it?
The barriers must have put too big a strain on the generator system.
You could have mentioned that might happen!
Did Haruto and Saki get taken out?
That could never happen!
Then why has the power gone out?
Calm down, people!
Inuzuka-senpai!
Otamaya! Are you in here?
We need you to get the generators back
Don't do it, Thunder!
That thing isn't what you think it is!
Get lost.
You're nothing but a lapdog tor that stinking detector!
You can't! This is
You said you wanted to get revenge, too!
I know exactly how you feel!
But that's just your ego talking!
For everyone to survive, it should be piloted by someone with the knack for it!
You guys can wallow in your pity party on the net if you want...
But I don't want any of it.
I have to do something! Personally!
I'll never be able to live with myself if I don't get revenge!
It's to keep more people from dying!
It's so we can all be happy!
We? Who's we?
Does this we include you?!
Cause a we that don't include yourself don't mean jack!
When she laughed, it made me happy, too.
She didn't believe in herself, she was kind, and she could be happy for others.
She didn't like shiitake mushrooms.
She didn't like tragedies but she loved horror movies.
She looked so tiny when she cried that it made you want to hold her.
Made you want to kiss her.
Made you want to be with her forever!
What the hell are you talking about
I don't want to do this for us.
I want to fight for myself!
There are 17 students with a pilot aptitude of rank A.
Of those, the ones with the mindset to get in voluntarily are the most suitable to be pilots.
This is...
This is what happened to him?
I've made up my mind!
Cain was having trouble against opponents like this?
In the end, he's only a spymaster.
They aren't spies.
The Karlstein Agency is a training school for agents that
I know!
Main guns, fire at will! Blow their whole ceiling away!
Blitzendegen!
No!
We're done for!
What the?
Our main guns!
Who is that?
God's touched me, too.
Isn't that right, Aina?
Form up! Waffen, position 7!
How do you like that?
Stupid amateur! Your back is wide open!
Oh, crap!
Take that, you Dorssian dick!
Yamada?!
It's Thunder'!
You... You hit Yes?
Oh, you mean that thing about resigning humanity or whatever?
Oh, you did it, too...
I'll explain later! For now...
Yeah! I'm gonna avenge Nobu!
It has eight arms?!
Ten, counting its original two!
I can see that!
Superconducting fluid accelerator cannon, prepare to fire!
But sir! At this angle, we'll hit our own forces!
That's an order!
Kyuma Inuzuka. 068 is the enemy's flagship.
Crush the head of the snake, huh?
That's a siege cannon meant for assaulting fortified positions.
It's not the most accurate weapon...
But they're between us and the target!
Tell me, Aina...
If I had told you how I felt, would you have given me the go-ahead?
Would it have put you on the spot?
Or would it have made you happy?
Fire!
Aina!
Impossible!
The accelerator cannon was deflected?
Sure...
I understand, Aina!
Evasive!
There's no time!
No response from Commodore Manninger.
This makes four people.
Did they manage to reproduce them?
I knew it, I didn't mishear him!
Order all forces to withdraw.
This operation is over.
Thank you, Inuzuka-senpai!
Let me ride with you next time!
Hey, I saw you out there, Inuzuka!
Weren't you scared?
We can count on you, Senpai!
Way to go, Thunder!
I was wrong about you!
That's our Thunder!
You were awesome!
Got anything to say to me? I piloted it.
Escaping from solitary counts as a jailbreak.
You're in for another week.
You Not even a freaking Thank you?!
I'm surprised.
I never expected to see you in one of these.
What, it's out of character?
Nope! It's exactly like you.
L-elf!
Haruto?
L-elf! What about our promise?!
These two decided on their own to get in.
What could I have done?
That's a load of bull!
You should have been able to tell that those first enemies were decoys!
You give me too much credit.
Cut it out.
Senpai!
This is for the best.
Haruto, from now on, let us fight alongside you.
But...!
I got dumped. Clearly.
Aina told me not to come join her.
It isn't working?
Even though it has an official number designation?
Takumi Kibukawa. ID number JS27-9154277.
Master Fellow attached to the JIOR Army 4 Research Institute.
Aside from Rion Nanami, all the teachers were in the JIOR military.
Why was that?
Not just the teachers.
The city residents, the dock workers, we were all military personnel.
Come again?
Dude, these are awesome!
Okay, let's make these our local specialty!
When we get to the Moon, we'll get a ton of tourists!
These things will sell like crazy
We'd better register a trademark, too!
I'm saying that Module 77, even the students...
all of it was created for the Valvraves.
Next time, episode 10, Campaign Promise of Love.
Valvrave the Liberator...
The system that will expose the truth of the world.
