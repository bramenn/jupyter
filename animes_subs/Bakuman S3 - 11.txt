I'm just

with him.
The second chapter will be done soon, and it's quite a step up from the first.
Oh, that's Nakai for you.
He's a first class assistant
Then, let's discuss the 4th chapter
One theory is that chapter 4 is the result of the survey about chapter 1
I'm looking for more useful ideas
What kind? Tell us.
We're first in the initial ranking
Yay
Wow
No matter how many times we do it, it still feels good
wolf: 7th?
aaa take: That's not good. Or is it not that bad?
Anshi-K: Being below PCP is a big problem.
kenchan: Yeah, since we're fighting with them.
Yes. We must not be below PCP. We've been sucessful in overlapping with them,
so now we have to win based on content.
LL: Maybe we shouldn't try to overlap any more?
emo: Thats why I said from the start that trying to fight with them was foolish
nanamine: How could you say that now?
kenchan: What's with the people getting ready to abandon ship? Are you stupid?
pai: Who's being stupid here?
kenchan: You are
right: Both of you are
It fell again?!

Hey, how long are you going to lay around? Either get a job or get married!
Shut up. How about you find me a match, then?
Who wants to marry an unemployed guy?
Shut up! I'm thinking about my future in my own way!
Damn.
Hey, old man, give me a whole bottle!
You are Nakai Takurou, yes?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Nanamine Tooru, a new author who's just been serialized in Jack.
How is it? Is the apartment comfortable?
Can I really use any room except yours?
Of course!
I'll cover the rent, bills and food expenses.
We've got 14 assistants; let me know if you don't like any of them.
I'll fire them right away.
All to make it easier for you.
Clean up the art so that it doesn't lose to Aoki Kou's new series What God Gave Me, which started last issue,
and Ashirogi Mutou's PCP.
Aoki Kou and Ashirogi Mutou.
They're no match for me.
In fact, I worked for both of them.
You're amazing, Nakai!
And that woman...
I have a score to settle with Aoki Kou.
That's good to hear.

Pitting this against Nanamine's second chapter is a smart idea.
After running our mouths about winning, we'd better do it.
All that's left is to see how Nanamine plays his hand.
Oh, this is amazing, just like I expected!
At this rate, I don't need to butt in at all.
Leave it all to me.
Please take care of it, then.
Nakai, can I ask you something?
Yes?
Is there anything I can help you with?
Right here.
There's no boundary here between the ink and screentone...
Oh. In this situation, just match the ink and gradient tone together in the right amounts...
Actually, I can do this bit myself.
Thank you!
Excuse me, Nakai.
I'm also not sure where to ink because this area here isn't clearly marked...
So decide yourself how much should be covered, sketch it out and then show it to me!
The second chapter will be done soon,
and the manuscript is quite a bit better than the first.

I'm looking for more useful ideas
What kind? Tell us.
He's consulting with other people and using their ideas to make manga?
D-Don't surprise me like that!
Oh, sorry.
I didn't have enough money for pizza.
Here, take it.
Since you've seen so much already,
I guess I'll let you in on it.
This is how I get ideas from dozens of people,
and make the manga even better.
Isn't it a great way of doing things?
Th-The process of making manga sure has changed.
Nanamine, you're ahead of the times!
Don't give up on your dream!
Thank you for working on hideout door.
You won't let it end like this, right?!
Okay, I understand. Thank you.
The first chapter of What God Gave Me got 1st place in the final ranking!
Aoki's great!
PCP's in 4th.
If the first chapter of our arc got 4th,
then our third chapter two weeks from now will do well for sure!
Yeah.
But we'll have to see how many votes Nanamine's first chapter gets next week.
I feel like he'll get 1st place.
From the sample copy, it seems like a good read.
Well, it was good.
Well, I guess so.
Well?
Like Hattori said, I think he puts in too many ideas,
and it's a bit jumbled.
Really?
Your first chapter placed 2nd in the preliminary rankings.
2nd?!
And there's quite a large gap between it and 1st place.
It probably won't make it to 1st.
What God Gave Me was 1st in both the preliminary and final rankings, right?
Yes.
That shitty manga got 1st and I'm in 2nd?!
You forced in too many ideas.
That's why the story is scattered.
It's not too late.
Won't you at least let me have final judgment on the storyboard?
Get off your high horse.
I'm in 2nd!
That's a good rank!
It's odd for an editor to talk about that rank like it's a failure.
It didn't place 1st because it's too advanced for the readers to understand.
Wh-What?!
The people I'm getting ideas from have read every manga there is.
And they have a high average age.
Therefore, the contents are too difficult for the Jack readership.
All I have to do is lower the story to a level the average person can understand from the fourth chapter onwards.
Lower the level?
That's wrong!
Don't blame the readers because it's not going well!
The problem is your method
Take the manuscript and leave.
You've shared too much of your opinion as the 51st member.
You agreed, Kosugi. You said you'd do it my way.

And I'll lower the story to the readers' level starting with Chapter Four.
With this, I'll knock out PCP.
Mashiro
Okay. Thank you.
The first chapter of What You Need got 2nd. PCP's in 4th.
Nanamine didn't get 1st!
That means next week's PCP will crush it!
I hope so.
I was surprised when I saw the sample copy yesterday.
The art quality for the second chapter suddenly ramped up.
Yeah.
Huh?
The overall balance is better.
But, if you look closely,
it's all in the finishing touches like backgrounds and character shadows.
I can only guess he got a good assistant starting with this chapter.
But why starting with the second chapter?
Maybe this assistant didn't get there in time for the first one?
These shadows... buildings... and the sky...
It couldn't be.
Wow!
What You Need is 2nd... both the first and second chapters are in 2nd!
He's really a genius we haven't seen since Niizuma Eiji.
What's really amazing is how he intentionally bumped up the art from Chapter One to Chapter Two.
Is he a calculating-type genius?
Perhaps.
See? I was right.
CROW is in 3rd. PCP's in 4th.
Has there ever been a new author who's beaten CROW with their second chapter?
Kosugi, you acted like I was wrong last week.
Well, even so, you may continue to voice your opinion as the 51st member.
You've got the manuscript, so you can leave.
Nakai, the second chapter's in 2nd place!
Really?!
That's amazing.
It's all because you came on board.
What about Aoki Kou and Ashirogi Mutou?
PCP's in 4th, What God Gave Me is in 7th.
Aoki Kou's in 7th, and we're in 2nd!
Nanamine, that's great!
What?! We lost?
Yeah.
Shit.
Manga comes down to art, I guess.
We said we'd cancel him within 10 weeks.
But it looks like he'll keep going.
We don't know yet.
10 weeks might be impossible,
but we don't know yet.
9th?!
2nd place for the second chapter, and down to 9th for the third?!
Yeah. CROW is 2nd, What God Gave Me is
What's PCP at?
I don't care about the others.
If I lose to PCP, there's no point in purposely overlapping content with them!
PCP's in 4th.
It concerned me that the styles were so similar, but I had no idea you were doing it on purpose.
I've analyzed the result of the survey.
Most the people who wrote down What You Need also wrote PCP.
And they rated PCP above it.
It's eating your votes.
Are they saying that PCP is better than What You Need, which 50 people created?!
There's no point in purposely making it similar.
The more conscious you are of PCP, the more your originality will
You talk too much, Kosugi.
Take the manuscript and leave.
Leave!
What You Need dropped like a stone, didn't it?
The first and second chapters had the element of surprise,
but not the third chapter.
He keeps cramming too many ideas in, and it's even harder to read now.
The third chapter was 7th.
PCP was 4th.
7th?!
aaa The third chapter took 7th place. PCP is in 4th.
7th?
aaa That's not good. Or is it not that bad?
Being below PCP is a big problem.
That's not good.
Or is it not that bad?
Being below PCP is a big problem.
Yeah, since we're fighting with them.

Yes.
We must not be below PCP.
We succeeded in overlapping with them,
so now we have to win based on content.

How could you say that now?
What's with the people getting ready to abandon ship? Are you stupid?

You are.
Both of you are!
Everyone who thinks we shouldn't overlap with PCP, leave!
13th?!
This is what happens when you think you should lower the level of the story for normal people!
Leave, please.
I'm telling you to stop acting so high and mighty!
Even if I talked to you, my rank wouldn't go up!
Do whatever you want!
It fell again?!
aaa Because Chapter 4 was empty. Why did it end up like that?
Because he didnt include my idea.
Mine either!
Nanamine, don't go changing the story on us!

The most important thing is how to make it better.
The best thing would be to copy PCP's material before they do it themselves.

Hello?
How about we compete with the same story?
Compete with the same story?
I don't get what you mean.
Do a story with the same themes in the same issue.
I'll go along with whatever story you choose.
That way, it'll be easier to find out who's right and who's wrong.
Or are you too scared to go up against 50 people with the same story?
Nanamine.
You must be at your wit's end.
It would be a huge issue to have two similar stories in the same issue.
We won't rise to your provocation no matter what.
We're just going to do what we've always donework steadily on our PCP!
Dammit!
Editorial Department
Look, here.
The author of What You Need for a Meaningful School Life, currently serialized in Jack,
creates his work by using the opinions of 50 people he meets with on the Internet.

Make the character stand out again? Your editor is a moron. It's not that kind of a manga!
That idiot doesnt know what to say, so that's why he's talking about characters and stuff, probably.
What a talentless editor. Doesn't he understand realistic drawing is better?
He should just die.
What do you mean vulgar expressions? You mean like shit and fart?
Shit is shit. How else are you supposed to say it?
More importantly, here's what I just thought. Wouldnt it be better to switch the places of the main character and the heroine?
Oh! I get it! taka, you're a genius!
You're right! Let's ignore the editor and think about that
Is this for real?
Good morning.
Kosugi, over here.
Look at this.
How about it? Do you know what he's talking about?
Nanamine said it's a revolutionary method.
Revolutionary?!
You knew about this and you're letting him do it?!
No wonder.
He's only on the fifth chapter, and the characters are already shaky. The story's all over the place.
This isn't good.
Whether or not he announces it publicly,
we've already published it as a story by a single author.
The author of What You Need for a Meaningful School Life, currently serialized in Jack, creates his work by using the opinions of 50 people he meets with on the Internet. See below for the log of their conversation.
Make the character stand out again? Your editor is a moron. It's not that kind of a manga!
That idiot doesnt know what to say, so that's why he's talking about characters and stuff, probably.
What a talentless editor. Doesn't he understand realistic drawing is better?
He should just die.
What do you mean vulgar expressions? You mean like shit and fart?
Shit is shit. How else are you supposed to say it?
More importantly, here's what I just thought. Wouldnt it be better to switch the places of the main character and the heroine?
Oh! I get it! taka, you're a genius!
You're right! Let's ignore the editor and think about that
I'm worried about leakage of information.
I'll report this at next week's meeting.
Wait!
I'll do something about it.
Something?!

Kosugi...
I'm not asking to be transferred right away.
Since you're holding off on that request,
I also ask you to hold off on providing this information to next week's committee and getting him canceled.
Nanamine is talented.
If he does it by himself, I know he can write a good story.
But right now, he's being manipulated by others and is destroying his own manga.
He must realize that his method doesn't work by now!
Either way, at his current ranking, he'll be submitted as a possible candidate for cancellation at the next committee.
I know.
Even if Nanamine gets canceled at that meeting,
until then I'm going to try to build a proper editor-author relationship with him!
If I can't do it by then,
I'll take full responsibility!
Hiramaru,
Never Reaching You is getting a serialization!
Congrats!
I did it!
Huh? Why did you lose enthusiasm at the end there?
I'm really happy.
I promised Yuri.
But when I think about those hellish days starting once again...
It's too early to be negative.
Be happy for at least an hour.
Nanamine, it's me, Kosugi.
I'm coming in.
People left because we dropped a bit in the rankings...
People posted logs of our chats as revenge for me not using their ideas...
At this rate, we'll get pushed to the back of the magazine.
And I wouldn't be able to keep covering up the ranking...
I have to win... I have to win over PCP!
Nanamine...
What rank?
15th place in the preliminary ranking.
I was told we'll be in trouble at next week's serialization committee.
I want to have a good talk with you.
15th again?!
I think you should stop trying to compete with PCP.
Kosugi!
Kosugi, go over to Ashirogi's studio,
and if the storyboard for their next chapter is done, steal it!
What are you talking about?
I have to do their story before they do.
That way, they'll be copying me!
That's all I have left!
This isn't good.
He's not reflecting on his method; he's only thinking about how to beat Ashirogi!
Calm down, Nanamine!
Do as I say!
Don't be ridiculous!
Kosugi, you bastard!
Are you, an editor, abandoning your author?!

Huh?
Kosugi?
Um...
Will you compete against Nanamine with the same story in the same issue?
I'm begging you!
What're you saying?
Even you, Kosugi?
Nanamine wanted me to steal your storyboard from you,
so that he could do your story before you.
His judgment is that far gone.
He has talent.
But if he doesn't realize his method is wrong, he has no future.
I want to make him wake up.
It doesn't matter what kind of story it is.
Let him know ahead of time and have them appear in the same issue.
I'll let him do it and take the responsibility!
Well, won't the editing department get mad if we do it intentionally?
I've received permission from the Chief Editor and Hattori.
The Chief Editor approved it?!
Yes. Hattori also strongly supported me.
Show him the difference between you.
When Nanamine came to us with that request,
for a moment, I wanted to do it.
I didn't because I thought it would cause a problem.
But now we can go all out against him!
We'll do it!
