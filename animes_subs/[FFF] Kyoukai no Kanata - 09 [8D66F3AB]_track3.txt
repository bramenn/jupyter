My, my. She's much stronger than I had anticipated.
Honestly, I'm glad we're in the middle of the Calm.
Where do you think you're going?
Even during the Calm, you're this powerful?
Impressive!
But how about this?

Senpai, you've finally woken up!
Ai-chan!
It's quite the troublemaker, isn't it?
Big Bro!
I know! You don't need to worry.
Be careful!
Keep your eyes on the darn thing!
Yakiimo!

To think I just had this upgraded to an anti-demon gun...
This puts me in quite a bind.
You seem to be enjoying yourself despite that.
Really? That's good to hear.
I will not let things go as you had hoped!
I see.
I manipulated the light particles.
I've been conducting research on various topics, you see.
Is the Exterminator's Society backing you?
Senpai...
Ayaka-san!
Izumi-san!
Senpai...
Mitsuki!
Start shrinking the Cage! Don't allow any gaps!
Make sure it doesn't waver!
Concentrate! Maintain its current strength!
Got it!
Aren't demons supposed to become weaker during the Calm?
Normally, that demon would have given a Class A Exterminator a hard time.
I bet some Exterminator bit off more than he could chew and attracted it,
thinking he could beat it during the Calm.
Thank you...
Yakiimo.
Izumi-neesama...
The door's locked.
Doesn't look like he's come back yet.
Allow me...
But why did Akihito transform into a demon?
When he was unconscious, Ayaka-san told me
that his human half had grown terribly weak.
Even though his demon half has been weakened by the Calm,
his human half might be even weaker right now!
It seems that his demon half has taken control as a result.
Right.
That would explain why Akihito-kun's demon form was weaker than it had been in the past.
That's why he fled.
Oh, I'm sorry!

It simply does not feel natural.
How unpleasant.
Check out those boxes over there.
What a sicko!
It's a shame that the half-demon, one of the rarest kinds of demons, is like this.
I don't think it's fair to criticize him after you've gone through his stuff without his permission.
But this is just too much!

I'll go ahead and set it up so I'll know if anyone comes in.
What was that?!
Another demon?
All three of you, be prepared to fight at a moment's notice.
He could be nearby.
Right.
Mitsuki, fall back.
You got it!
Did you really expect me to respond like that?
This is serious!
I'll run if I feel like my life is in any danger.
More importantly...
What are you going to do if you wind up having to fight him?
This isn't anything all that new.
I imagine Akkey is also prepared for what's to come.
But remember what Akihito's mother said?
She warned him to be careful during the Calm.
If you fight Akihito like before and injure him like you have in the past, he will...
What the heck is that?
Did Akkey do this?
Probably.
Is he still in the area?
I'm not certain. Hiromi, create a Cage.
On it.
Um... Shouldn't we be searching for Senpai?
I suppose.
This is merely based on my personal deductions.
You do not have to listen to me, and I cannot make you do this.
Regardless, I'm going to say this because I believe it is for the best.
Kuriyama-san, the moment you find Akihito-kun,
kill him.
Mirai?
Y-Yes?
How long are you going to stay in the shower?
I'm sorry.
The Calm has completely upset Akihito-kun's internal balance between his human and demon halves.
If he is still in his current state when the Calm ends,
we can assume that Akihito-kun's demon half will suppress his human half,
considering it has already taken control of his body.
When that happens, he will simply be a powerful demon with the gift of immortality.
Akihito-kun will lose his human half.
He will be despised as a demon forever.
Even so...
Of course, all of this is purely speculation.
There is no guarantee that this will come to pass.
But if what I just described does become reality,
he will be unstoppable.
You must decide now how you're going to act.
During the Calm, he will have lost his immortality.
During the Calm, you can kill Akihito-kun.
This... can't be real.
You're raising the gas bill.
What's wrong with you?!
I finally got you to talk.
Are you hungry?
No.
So something did happen.
What makes you say that?
Why?
Why is it so weird for me to not be hungry?
Don't cry.
Put a shirt on! Disgusting...
The right to barge in and issue demands is reserved for my little sister.
Big Bro, what do you think?
About?
What Izumi-neesama told us.
There's nothing to think about.
But she told Kuriyama-san to kill Akihito!
That's just so...
It's certainly understandable, considering the situation.
Then you should kill him for her!
I would if I could!
But even in the middle of the Calm,
if you wanted to make sure Akkey was killed,
Kuriyama Mirai is your best bet.
Big Bro...
More importantly...
More importantly?
Never mind.
Using these methods,
we should obtain Beyond the Boundary within a day or two.
I'm counting on it.
Making another report?
Yes. I feel the Nase family has grown too large.
All of them buzzing around gives me a headache.
Now hurry off to bed.
I ran into Fujima Miroku.
I see.
What do you hope to get out of using Kuriyama Mirai?!
I didn't believe him at first,
but I've changed my mind after seeing the way you act around her.
It's obvious that you're just using her...
to kill Akkey!
And then there's Akkey turning into a demon.
There isn't anything pointing to what could have weakened Akkey's human half so much.
Izumi-neesan, did you use a frozen barrier to weaken Akkey's human half?
Izumi-neesan!
Be careful.
The Exterminator's Society is conspiring to topple the Nase family.
About time!
Things are finally starting to get interesting!
You didn't have to force yourself to come.
It's easier to be here than home alone.
What happened?
I'll tell you eventually.
Sakura...
Kuriyama-san.
Hiromi-senpai?
You haven't explained the situation to her?
I haven't.
First of all, I don't really consider her an Exterminator.
Plus, it's easier on me this way.
Look behind you.
Isn't that a...
Supposedly it's part of a demon...
known as Beyond the Boundary.
Beyond the Boundary...
Don't kill Akkey.
I'd like you to contact me if you find him.
Kuriyama-san, do you...
Never mind.
When I first met Senpai up here, what do you think he told me?
In short, I love girls with glasses!
I thought he was crazy.
I was like, What's this demon going on about?‚Äù
That sounds like Akkey.
I wish I never met him.
If I knew that this was waiting for me,
I wish I had never met Senpai.
I feel like someone has it out for me.
I think that maybe, just maybe...
I really am cursed.
I'm sorry to have called you out here.
It's fine.
I don't have a doubt in my mind
that Izumi-neesan is trying to get Kuriyama Mirai to kill Akkey.
The question is, why?
Would the Nase family somehow profit from killing Akkey?
The elimination of an immortal half-demon...
No, something like that is too simple for this intricate plan.
That phenomenon!
That phenomenon has been described as a part of Beyond the Boundary.
It couldn't be!
Only one piece of Beyond the Boundary has appeared thus far.
That means the rest of it has to exist somewhere else!
It must be terribly strong, possessing an overwhelming power!
It would be the ultimate demon, capable of leading the world to its destruction.
If such a demon existed...
He's the only one who fits that description!

Yes!
Hey! Hello?
Hello?!
