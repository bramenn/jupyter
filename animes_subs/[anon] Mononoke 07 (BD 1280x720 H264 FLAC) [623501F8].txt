OP
ED
Faceless One
The blue moon illuminated
your wandering shadow.
I could never tell you all I wanted to say.
It was so very frustrating.
I think about your faked smile,
and forget all the hot tears we shed.
What do these empty husks,
those empty eyes of yours, reflect, my dear?
The transient quarter moon
hides in a rift in the clouds,
as darkness seeps up from the ground.
Tell me the truth, please.
Are you so despondent
that you still sit alone, sighing?
Part the Second
The End
Feelings and memories
They exist only within my heart.
Though we may pass the same time, or see the same sights,
what we hold within our hearts can never be the same.
Your face, your voice,
the image of you, which exists only within me
Who are you?
Im afraid I wont bend to your will.
If you will not show me your true Form, then at least
be quiet
for a while.
What?
Please.
What are you doing?
Stop it!
My, my.
Such a contrary thing.
Well then, shall we restart our little play?
Play?
The intertwined fates of men give the Mononoke its Form.
When an Ayakashi clings onto a persons thoughts and feelings,
it becomes a Mononoke.
I see. You came here to kill the Mononoke.
I see. You came here to kill the Mononoke.
If I could kill it now, my work would be easy.
I must discover the Mononokes Truth and Regret,
and without its Form,
I cannot draw the Sword of Exorcism.
This is a troublesome Mononoke, indeed.
Truth is a physical state,
and Regret is a state of mind.
If the Mononoke will not show me its Form,
I will have to make it tell me
its Truth and Regret.
Ochous life,
Part the First.
My life?
My life?
Sake! Sake!
I need more sake!
I told you to bring me more sake! What are you doing?
What a worthless wife you have.
Im sorry!
The Mononoke is showing me what you feel.
The perfect feelings for a Mononoke to leech.
This is not a laughing matter!
Yes it is. Quite funny, indeed.
With such a laughable situation as an excuse,
how many did you kill?
how many did you kill?
This is the result of relying on the Mononokes strength.
Relying on
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?
The sky?
Thats right.
The sky.
Your very own sky,
which you watched every day.
My own sky?
My own sky?
I told you to bring me more sake! What are you doing?
IIm sorry!
You simply looked.
I was only looking, but it made me happy.
Why did you not leave this place?
Stop it.
Who is it that you really killed?
Stop it.
Stop it.
Who did I really kill?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Ochou-san,
who did you kill?
who did you kill?
Stop it!
Step no further into Ochou-sans heart!
Ochou-san,
if you believe this place binds you, it will be your prison.
If you do not wish to leave, it will become a fortress.
Its the same as that place.
You thought of it as a prison.
I told you to bring me more sake! What are you doing?
IIm sorry!
IIm sorry!
Why did I not simply leave?
Mother.
You look just like I did when I was young.
With your beauty, you will certainly be able to marry into a wealthy family.
Mother,
Ill do my best.
This is most difficult.
I loved my mother.
Stop it, Ochou-san!
You dont have to tell him anything!
He is deceiving you!
Be quiet.
The play is not over.
Ochous life,
Part the Second.
You were born beautiful.
What is this?
Mind your appearance carefully,
Mother?
and you will be able to marry into a wealthy family, in spite of your humble upbringing.
Yes, Mother!
Good girl. Good girl.
I loved my mother.
I wanted her praise.
So you bore it,
to the point of losing your own soul.
My soul?
My soul?
How many times must I say it?
Im sorry!
Ive warned you about that so many times!
Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Watch.
Start over from the beginning.
Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Youll never be a proper lady at this rate!
One more time!
Yes.
No.
No.
One and two and three!
No.
Four and five and six!
Seven and eight and nine!
No.
No.
Stop this.
I hid myself, so as not to interrupt your taking of vows.
Mother.
Ochous life,
Part the Third.
I merely wish to express my gratitude and extend my best wishes.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Please, sit up now.
We derive no pleasure from watching you prostrate yourself.
My goodness, such a gorgeous lady she is.
Are you as good in bed as you look?
Oh my, stop it!
Thats for our brother to find out!
I can buy as many women as I want with money.
Please! Please!
Please, keep her for all her life!
Is this your mothers wish?
Yes.
My father died young, and his pension was confiscated.
My father died young, and his pension was confiscated.
All my mother wished was for me to marry into wealth.
That was the only thing she wished for.
Now I can finally hold my head high as I visit the graves of my ancestors, the Umezawake clan.
I see.
So, you became your mothers tool, to further her ends.
No!
Then, what is that?
Again?
You lost your soul for your mothers wish.
You became a tool for your mothers selfish ends.
Then, you fell in love.
You
But the object of your affections
Who was he?
What?
Ochous life,
Part the Fourth.
I told you to bring me more sake! What are you doing?
IIm sorry!
Ochou-san, just get us some more sake!
What a worthless wife you have.
A lazy girl, indeed.
Brother, whyever did you take her in?
Her mother begged me to.
If your first wife hadnt hung herself, would you ever have accepted her into your home?
Well, shes a pretty good cook,
and good in bed, too!
Oh stop, youre just terrible!
Ochou-san,
who did you kill?
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it. Stop it.
Ochou-san,
that mask is not
a Mononoke.
A Mononoke controls the masked man.
A Mononoke controls the masked man.
It deceived you,
and imprisoned you.
That is its Truth.
Lies.
And in trying to accept your mothers twisted love,
And in trying to accept your mothers twisted love,
No! No! No! No! No! No!
No! No! No! No! No! No!
your heart wavered, and a Mononoke latched onto it.
No! No! No! No! No! No!
No! No! No! No! No! No!
No! No! No! No! No! No!
That is the Regret.
No! No! No! No! No! No!
I loved my mother.
Mother, look!
Youre so beautiful.
You can fulfill my dream and marry into wealth.
I did my best.
I did my best, but
No! No! No!
No! No more.
Mother, listen! Listen to me!
Mother, listen to me!
I cant wait!
Mother, listen to me!
Why wont you listen to what I have to say?
Why wont you listen to what I have to say?
Mother, listen to me!
All four of these men are wealthy and prosperous.
Mother, why wont you listen to me?
Mother, why wont you listen to me?
Listen
I cant wait. I cant wait
Listen
I cant wait. I cant wait
Listen to me.
I cant wait. I cant wait
I cant wait. I cant wait
Im so stupid.
Ochou.
Who was it that you killed?
Who was it that you killed?
Who did I
kill?
All of them
were me?
You lost yourself in others greed.
Why?
You are a Mononoke.
Show me
your Form.
Its me!
I am
the Mononoke!
May I ask you one thing?
May I ask you one thing?
Why did the Faceless One
Why did it save me?
Do you believe you were saved?
If you wish to know,
perhaps it fell in love
with you.
His love could never be.
The Mononoke despaired.
The Mononoke despaired.
The Mononoke despaired?
The Mononoke despaired?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ill be fine.
I told you to bring me more sake! What are you doing?
IIm sorry!
Ochou-san, just get us some more sake!
What a worthless wife you have.
A lazy girl, indeed.
Brother, whyever did you take her in?
Her mother begged me to.
If your first wife hadnt hung herself, would you ever have accepted her into your home?
Well, shes a pretty good cook,
and good in bed, too!
Oh stop, youre just terrible!
Hey, what are you doing?
Lazy bitch.
Youre totally useless.
Indeed, she is.
Shes so damned lazy.
Hey!
Useless indeed.
Ochou!
Cant you hear?
Still not here?
She lazes around so, whatever she does.
I just cant stand her!
Whats taking her so long, I wonder?
Ochou!
Sake! Sake!
Bring us sake!
Wheres the sake?
But theres no-one here.
But theres no-one here.
But theres no-one here.
Without you, I just cant smile.
I walk this banal town,
feeling such intense emotions.
I know that if I could treasure them and live on,
I would need nothing else.
The summer flowers that bloomed in the sky
Come falling down, dancing in the wind.
I can barely recall the night sky
where they all came tumbling down,
so what I can still recall is all the more precious.
