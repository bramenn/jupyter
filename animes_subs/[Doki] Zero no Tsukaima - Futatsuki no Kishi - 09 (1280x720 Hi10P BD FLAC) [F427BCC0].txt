But
The truth is, I want to be by your side more than anyone else
Lets go take a walk in chains of love!
The Flame of Atonement
The Flame of Atonement
Next Time
The Enemy at the Snowy Mountain
I was only the vice-captain at the time.
Flame Snake was the captain.
He was referred to as Enjya.
What?
I'm in search of that man myself!
That man who inflicted a wound upon me...
I want to burn that man.
That's all I wish for!
They don't know that we're here.
That's the key to this surprise attack.
They're professionals!
Cheap tricks won't work against them!
You stay out of this!
But...
All right, let's come up with a plan.
Someone should rush in as a decoy.
Simply rushing in won't do.
We need the enemy to focus only on that person.
Hold on.
What?
I can bring an end to this matter.
So leave this to me.
Sensei.
Saito-kun, lend me a hand.
Just reminiscing gives me a chill.
The captain who razed Dungletale was amazing.
He burned the village instantly, without any change in emotion,
into ashes.
I was attracted to him because of his perfection.
So I ambushed him form behind.
A little mistake from the aberration that was my youth, I tell you.
How strong is our captain? Is his strength real?
I wanted to confirm his strength.
He was the real thing!
He burned me with ease!
What will you be using these for?
Just keep your hands moving.
Okay...
You said that in your world, everyone is equally skilled at using all technologies, correct?
Well, with some studying and training, yes.
I see. That's a wonderful thing.
I'd like to take a look at your world one day.
How long are they going to make us wait? Geez!
We need to hurry, or else everyone will...
Forget it, we'll go by ourselves!
Wait a while longer.
Fine.
It's done, Sensei.
Okay, let's go.
You're... insane!
Maybe I am.
Let us stop talking about the past now.
It's about time for negotiations.
Principal.
Send a messenger to Henrietta.
Have her sign a pledge in which she promises to withdraw her troops from Albion.
What?
An unconditional agreement to withdraw her troops.
T-That's impossible!
I don't have the right to make Her Highness do that!
You don't mind having your cute students burn to ashes?
Saito-kun, when you... head eastwards...
When you decide to go back to your world...
Yes?
Take me with you.
Saito!
Sorry to make you all wait.
What took you so long?
What's that?
I'll need to borrow everybody's strength.
What a stupid method.
Stop it, Julio-kun.
When the front line hears of this, they'll respond with a full-scale attack.
You're only cornering yourself.
Albion doesn't think enough.
It looks like you have a death wish!
What's this?
What are these doing here?
Our top priority is to rescue everyone, okay?
Don't bother with the enemies!
Understood.
All right, now!
Now!
Gotcha!
Let's go, Tabitha!
No, don't fight with them!
You brats...!
Saito!
Agnes!
Looks like our strategy worked.
All right, get everyone out!
Kirche! Tabitha!
Nice try.
Don't tell me... your eyes...
Ever since my eyes were burned, they couldn't sense light.
How can you see, then...?
They say snakes perceive prey via their temperature.
Since I use flame, I started to get rather sensitive, too.
I can tell one person from another by their temperatures.
I want to smell it.
I want to smell the scent of you burning!
No...
Sensei!
Colbert-sensei!
Get away from my student.
It's you!
It's you, it's you, it's you!
This is the temperature I've been searching for!
I've been looking for you! How nostalgic!
Captain-dono!
What?!
You've... lost your ability to see?
Yes, thanks to you.
Colbert-sensei was... the captain?
Sensei...
Sensei?
You're a teacher?!
No wonder I never saw you in any wars!
I would've never imagined that you'd become a teacher.
You, who were once called Enjya!
En... jya?
Yes, he was referred to as Enjya the Flame Snake.
He's the one that burned everything, woman and child!
And he's the one who stole the light from both of my eyes!
As expected of my captain.
It looks like you haven't lost your skills.
That's right... that's how it should be!
Miss Zerbst. Take Miss Tabitha and get out of here!
Y-Yes.
Saito-kun, Miss Valliere, take everyone out of here.
Yes!
Hurry, Louise!
Um, the spell to undo a rope is...
I did it!
Wasn't it pure luck?
Well done, Louise.
This way!
Colbert is my foe.
The man who killed my father and mother.
The one who took everything away from me!
Die!
Agnes-kun!
Stay away!
Don't fuck with me!
I'll be the one to kill you!
Butt out, plebeian.
I have no business with you!
It's dangerous! Get away from me!
Never!
How does it feel to burn to death, Captain-dono?!
I've been waiting for this moment.
The day I burn you to death!
I thank you, Captain-dono.
Kam Diela...
Kam Diela...
I was able to become this strong because of my devotion towards exacting revenge upon you!
Dil Ryofu.
Dil Ryofu.
I would expect this much from you, Flame Snake.
I'm no longer the inexperienced lad I once was!
My flame...
You're no... d-different from before...
What?
You're still... so full of yourself!
Damn you!
Waz Wagaraz Wagaruze Winde!
Take this!
Take my village's rancour!
Are you all right?
I'm glad...
Why did you save me...
I realised... my mistake.
Colbert-sensei!
Sensei!
Sensei!
Step away!
What do you plan on doing?
Don't get in my way!
Stop it, Agnes!
Please, stop!
Move!
I've lived only to see this day!
Twenty years...
For twenty years!
Stop it, Agnes!
Please stop, I beg of you!
Move!
Miss Zerbst.
Please... move...
Agnes-kun... has the... right... to... kill me.
Sensei...
Tye Gyoph.
Something's strange, Captain.
I don't see any signs of an epidemic here.
What?
It was then that I realised... the sin I had committed.
I always thought that... obeying orders was... the correct... thing to do.
But...
Even during war... killing a person is...
Agnes-kun, kill me.
But... make this your last... and... stop killing... any further.
Who do you think you are to tell me this?!
Agnes!
Stop it!
Don't get in my way!
Agnes... sheathe your sword.
Don't fuck with me!
He has passed away...
What...?
Agnes.
So this was where you were.
Take it.
A letter?
We found this when we were cleaning up Colbert's room.
I can't read it, though.
Saito-kun, I am writing this letter with the intention of giving it to you when you go to war.
I've once committed a sin.
In order to atone for my sin, I've devoted myself to research.
Recently, a thought has been crossing my mind...
So Saito-kun, I want you to promise me.
Don't get used to people dying.
Don't get used to fighting.
Don't get used to killing.
Saito-kun, you've told me many stories.
Stories of the world that you came from.
I want to see that world.
Please take me there some day.
That's all.
Thank you.
He's just rambling on...
Will you never be able to forgive Colbert-sensei?
How would I know?
Agnes...
Colbert-sensei wanted to go to your world, right?
He was a strange person, after all.
Don't cry.
I'm... not crying.
You don't have to hide it.
You dog!
We'll freeze to death if we crash into a snowy mountain!
What? Warm each other up with our body heat?
Zero no Tsukaima. Futatsuki no Kishi.
The Enemy at the Snowy Mountain.
If you want to meet me again next week, then sit tightly and wait!
