What's happened so far!
Arima Souichirou. Excellent grades,
good in all sports...
Generally a sociable guy who would never make any enemies.
Furthermore, he's a thoroughbred
from a super famous family of doctors......dating back to the Edo Period.
Miyazawa Yukino. Elegant and graceful,
blessed with both beauty and intelligence.
Though an ordinary commoner raised in a middle class family...
The two, who captivate the multitudes around them with their charm,
met in high school.
However,
Arima found out the other day that
his opposite number was a mongrel!
Sis is a moron.
Even worse, he had confessed his love to her!
But Sis, without a second thought, flatly turned him down.
And right afterwards, this happened.
Sis is really a moron.
She's a carp on a cutting board!
Having dug her own grave,
Sis is now between a rock and a hard place!
Now, what will you do, Miyazawa Yukino?!
And what about you, Arima Souichirou?!
You can tell that something is excellent with just one glance.
Arima found out everything.
I'll regret it forever.
He's a sharp guy.
I'm sure he figured out everything just by looking at me.
Everything about me at school is a bluff...
Living in vanity. The very embodiment of vanity!
That was me - Miyazawa Yukino's true form.
So, what're you going to do, Arima?
Tell everyone and make a Laughingstock out of me?
Go around holding me in contempt?
Or are you going to sympathize with me about how foolish I am...
Why did Arima, of all people, have to find out?!
He's the one person I wouldn't want to laugh at me, or scorn me...or feel
sorry for me!
Hey, guys, Miyazawa was
just looking this way.
Could it be me?
Moron, who'd go out with you?
Yeah, really.
But she's really something.
All slim and feminine and stuff...
Maybe I should go and confess my love to her...
It's no use.
You'd just end up getting hurt.
I waited for judgement day with much anxiety.
All those girls who are smiling at me now...
When they find out tomorrow that they've been deceived...
UUU...
By the way, about last lecture...
The teacher's so mean...
And he just talks forever...
I wish he'd give us a break...
Yeah, really.
But, even after several days,
Arima hasn't said anything to me.
It doesn't look like he told anyone...
Even after days and days passed nothing at all happened. **Several days several days several...**
Finally, a week later...
Could it be that he just let it slide?
That's it!
It's because he's been brought up well and has good character!
He wouldn't go around talking behind people's backs... and doing petty things like that!
That's it! I'm so LUCKY! ALRIGHT!
So, I was relieved.
Gotta go to the library.
But at that time, who would have guessed...
You're letting your face slip.
Am I some kind of demon?
Surprised you, huh?
I know what you're thinking.
I saw you at a bad time, didn't I?
You had even me completely fooled.
I never would have thought that the innocent Little Miyazawa was this kind of person.
I bet everyone will be so surprised!
I bet it'll be a big sensation.
I wonder how they'll react...
Maybe they'll laugh. Maybe they'll be disgusted.
What is it, Miyazawa?
Don't... don't tell anyone.
Don't tell anyone, p-l-e-a-s-e.
Don't tell anyone, please.
Okay, fine.
Lucky!
Could you do those for me by tonight?
Well, I've got practice to go to, so...
What is this?
And who was that just now?!
Who the heck was that freaky dude?!
Well then, Arima, translate what we just read.
Yes. ma'am. He was gasping for breath...
But as he looked greatly pained and sorely tired. The Emperor...
Now then, Miyazawa, interpret it.
Yes, ma'am.
The words men and women are used here to symbolize and express the rise of emotions.
In those times death inside the court was considered unclean...
Yes, that's correct.
Extremely impressive job from you two.
They echo words of admiration so easily.
None of these people know...
After that, the
curtain rose on my tragedy.
Evening! Ah, you're really going at it.
Good work. Wow, perfect!
And you're done already.
Incredible. That's my Miyazawa.
Now see here! What do you think you're doing?!
Why're you making me do this stuff?!
Because,
I'm taking advantage of your weakness...
Don't say it so bluntly!
That's called blackmail.
Haven't you any shame?
Yeah.
But I can't help it.
I'm way busy,
and it's a major help having you sub for me.
You little...
So, you'll be useful to me.
Well, I won't force you.
If you don't want to do it, just say so.
If you've got the guts.
You scheming little bastard!
I never expected this. Who would've thought he had another side of him too?
I've been my own master for these 15 years...
I've never been so humiliated in my entire life! What the hell is with him? Dammit!
But, this sounds like a good deal for you.
Riiight?
He's taking the pains to show you the harsh realities of life.
Not only the emptiness of vanity, but also that greatness, is all relative.
Not!
He's not that nice of a guy!
Dammit!
But, I have no way to escape from his trap.
There was nothing I could do but curse my own fate.
But soon afterwards...
Now I'm tied up with Arima's work all day long!
Hey, did you know Yoshida,
the math teacher, has false teeth?
No way!
That was really...
Hey, pass, pass! Alright...
How could you make a girl do all this work...?
Pretending to cry won't work.
You're actually callous
and tough, aren't you?
None of your business!
What work is it this time?
Making a schedule for the Class Trip Committee.
Gack! Are you doing that too?
Since I was being made to help,
it was certainly clear that Arima was super-busy.
The Student Council...the Service Club
the Class Trip Committee... on executive committees
for various events... a part of the main staff for all of them.
And on top of that,
he does club sports...studies...
Of course, I weasel out of most of it.
You're gonna die if this keeps up.
It seems I stand out or something, I guess.
That must be tough.
I would have thought that your looks and brains
would have brought you a better life...
Oh, I see. I guess so.
Well, since you're here, it's all good.
I'm your dog?
Woof woof.
Arima,
you were Student Council President in junior high, right?
Yeah. And you?
I did that too.
Well, it must've been tough then.
Uh-uh, not really.
What? How come?
What should I do?
I can't do all this...
What a fraud! So that's the kind of person you really were.
Hey! You're doing exactly the same thing!
What? That's not true.
I act normally all the time.
This is all due to your influence right now.
Oh, so it's my fault? How dare you!
It's true, you know.
Wow, it's pitch-black outside.
Miyazawa, you hungry?
Hungry? Sure.
Then I can treat you to something...once in a while.
Arima is somehow perfect.
I want steak!
You blockhead.
Where did that come from, I wonder?
Until yesterday, there was nothing at all.
Until recently...
Hey, check it out!
Those two...
It shouldn't have been anywhere at all...
Like, that rumor's gotta be true!
No doubt about it!
You awake?
Practice just finished, so I came over.
You shouldn't fall asleep like that.
Suddenly, he seemed special to me.
Arima seemed special to me.
What was with Arima just then?
What is this sensation?
This feeling I can't place?
My head feels all foggy and I can't sit still.
This is the first time I've felt this way.
Wait! Could it be...
This isn't that Love thing I've often heard of, is it?
Like crush... and romance, and
falling for someone?!
No way, not me...! Ridiculous. I don't believe it.
I guess I just don't understand myseIf.
And yet...What a pain.
Let's's eat!
Hey, you sure come home
Late these days, Sis.
What?
Oh, I've got stuff to do for the class committee.
That's all?
Well, yeah.
See, you had it all wrong.
Well, I don't know...
Now what?
What, what?
What are you talking about?
But it's really weird!
You started coming home late all of a sudden.
You used to talk a lot about school, but not these days.
And most importantly,
you stopped wearing your sweats.
Sis, you got a boyfriend, don't you?
Wh...wh...wh...
WHAAAT??!!
A g...g...guy, is it?
Your father, who loves you more than anyone in the world...
Of course, I love Tsukino and Kano more than anyone in the world, too, but...
You pick another man over your father?!
What the heck are you babbling about?
Hey, she's nervous.
I knew it.
I'd love to see a picture.
I wonder if he's good looking?
Probably some hunk.
Even more than me?
No doubt.
Yuki's pretty choosy about looks...
I wonder who she got that from?
I'm telling you,
it's just work!
Yukino!
I swear, they're so inconsiderate...
If I had felt this way after meeting normally, there wouldn't be any trouble.
That's right. I'm troubled.
Because Arima...
Hey, hey, Miyazawa.
Are you and Arima...going out?
You two are together a lot recently...
But I don't mean anything funny...
You two look really cute together,
and even if we're a bit jealous...
most suited for him.
And I was just wondering what was really going on.
It's true that he said he liked me, but...
Hey, this one brave girl went up to Arima and asked him the same thing.
And I hear that Arima just Laughed and didn't answer.
I thought so. I've been thinking...
Where did that confession go inside Arima? He hasn't brought it up at all since then.
I figured this would happen, but...
Arima loved the me before he knew my true identity.
Not the real me.
I fell in love with him after I knew his true identity, but...
Miyazawa!
Sorry, would you stay late today?
I don't need you for much today,
so it won't take long.
I see. So it completely vanished from within him.
Oh, you're still here.
I saw the classroom lights from outside.
Did it take that long?
It's done already.
I see.
I'm not doing this anymore.
Huh?
I'm finished. I won't help any more.
But if you do that, you'll be in all sorts of trouble, won't you?
I don't care. Tell them.
Wait! What're you mad about?
I'm not mad. Let go.
You're mad, aren't you?
If something made you mad all of a sudden, tell me.
I can't understand this way.
It's okay.
It's not okay!
Let's go...I said let go!
I'm sick of being used!
Miyazawa!
We always talked like friends,
so I'd forgotten.
Arima was just taking
advantage of my weakness.
How could he?!
He totally changed his attitude when he found out my true identity...
How could he?!
So I'm gonna end it right here.
Wh...wh...why're you following me?
Because you're running away!
Stay away! Stay away!
Won't happen!
Dammit!
You don't have to run away Like your life depended on it!
I said wait, you little...!
This could look compromising...
You're still running away?!
Aren't you all scraped up?
Show me your face!
So I'm a weirdo!
I'm vain, seIfish, a liar, a schemer, and I'm greedy!
I'm sure you were disappointed!
But, why did you have to change your attitude towards me?!
If I'm not acting elegant, am I that worthless?!
I hate you! Don't touch me!
I'm sorry.
Am I really that weird?
If I'm not the model student, am I really without any value?
Not at all.
I like you the way you are right now. It's fun.
Sorry, I didn't mean it that way.
I never intended to tell
anyone from the start.
I didn't want to seriously use you...
I just wanted a reason.
A reason to talk with you.
I thought it would be fun...
It was fun!
I've never talked with anyone like that before.
But I never thought it was hurting you.
I'm sorry. I won't ask you to help any more.
So that's it.
So it wasn't that he didn't care about me...
I'm glad. I guess I had a good cry.
From that day on, Arima and I
became companions,
sharing the same secret.
So, you're an only child?
Somehow it figures. *She's helping out after all*
And you?
I've got two little sisters.
Are your sisters cute?
Well, to be totally accurate,
Arima may have misunderstood a bit...
Yeah, they're super obnoxious and SO cute!
I'll show them to you sometime!
Obnoxious and cute? Oh, well.
He thinks I snapped because I was being overworked.
Well, that's okay.
At any rate, I now know that
I'm something special to Arima...
Even if it's not love.
But you really had me going, you know.
I didn't know you were
Like this either.
Yeah...
I'm surprised myseIf.
You might not believe it...
I had this in me...until I met you.
Why does it bother me?
Why do I let myseIf be influenced?
I'm being drawn to you more and more and becoming somebody else.
I wonder if that's a good thing...
What'll happen next!
The two of them make up! Will they enter straight into a love-love mode?!
But it won't be that easy!
Arima suddenly turns cold!
Is Sis gonna get dumped?!
His Circumstances!
