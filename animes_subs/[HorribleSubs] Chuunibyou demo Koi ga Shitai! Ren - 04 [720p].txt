My name is Shinka Nibutani.
I am a Year Two student at Icho Private High School.
I'm a little bit of a klutz, and can be stubborn...
Okay, time to go.
Oh, Nibu. Morning!
Morning.
Morning. Morning.
Morning, everyone.
What? We had math homework?
Haven't you done it either, Becky? I was counting on you.
Fukachi? Becky? Would you like to see my notes?
Are you sure?
MATH Shinka Nibutani
Here.
Thanks, Nibu!
I have no boyfriend. It's so lonely.
No straight-out copying, okay?
But to be honest, I'm not all that interested in romance right now.
Yeah, I know.
Aren't these answers above your grade, Fukachi?
After all, I have a grand dream.
What do you mean by that?
Yes, my grand dream.
A dream I want to become reality during my time in high school.
STUDENT COUNCIL ELECTION, PRESIDENT OF STUDENT COUNCIL, VICE-PRESIDENT, TREASURER, SECRETARY
I'll tell you what it is.
Working for the student council work is very rewarding.
You devote yourself for benefit of everyone in the school.
Would anyone like to be a candidate?
PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL
You can do it, Shinka!
Dreams can come true!
85TH ANNUAL STUDENT COUNCIL ELECTION
I was going to stop there on the way home. What do you say?
Shinka Nibutani
Backers?
That's right.
Would you write your name on this register?
I guess I could do that.
The Election For President Of The Student Council (Queen Maker)... Of Purity
Okay, thanks.
School: Wicked Lord Shingan, S Class Name: Rikka Takanashi
What is that girl writing?
Also, now that I'm a candidate...
You could at least remember the name of the club you belong to.
Image is important in an election.
If people knew I belonged to that club, it would harm my reputation.
Why the student council of all things?
Weren't you working hard in the theatre club?
That place is lacking somehow.
Not again.
I don't know what it is. The magnetic field?
The spiritual wavelength? It just doesn't feel right.
Maybe the guardian spirits are taking a different position on it.
Can you hear yourself?
Naturally, that has nothing to do with chunibyo!
I was only speaking in general, that's all!
Well, I won't try to stop you.
But you keep going on about your reputation.
People are already talking about you.
Like how you chased after a freshman, dressed as a witch.
And how you threatened a freshman with physical harm, dressed as a martian...
They could think you're a complete weirdo.
Those freshmen are all the one and the same!
In other words, she is my only problem.
Sanae Dekomori, servant to Wicked Lord Shingan, is here!
I will defeat you today, once and for all!
Ow. Speak of the devil.
What were you secretly discussing?
I can only assume that you were plotting petty wickedness!
Why would I do that?!
On this day, my attack power is doubled! Prepare yourself!
Take this! The Mjolnir Megaton Hammer!
I already calculated your range.
Nice try!
What?
Did you see that? Now you are mine!
What're you doing?
NURSE'S OFFICE
Do something!
Who, me?
I'll be going from class to class...
She'll be sure to interfere if she's around.
So you say.
You can do this.
Just get Takanashi to tell that idiot to knock it off.
So you're telling me to ask Rikka?
You're her boyfriend, right? You're going out, right?
Rikka, if you love me...
One little whisper, and she'll do it.
I can't say that! And why the heck do I have to do that for you?!
Help me!
I helped you lots when you told her how you felt about her.
Sure, but nobody asked you to.
I went all the way to Rikka's parent's house to help you, didn't I?
Sure, but nobody asked you to.
And what about that last date?
Nobody ever asked you to!
Ghelzonianses.
Where did you hear that?
Takanashi said she found it among your notes the other day.
It's the Dark Flame Master's secondary form, right? Ghelzon...
Stop it! In all of my dark history, that is uniquely embarrassing!
Is it? Okay then...
Far-East Magical Napping Society - Summer Thereof
Why am I doing this?
Ooh, the Dark Flame Master has descended.
It would appear, that due to the urging of the Wicked Lord Shingan...
Ooh! Is this an omen of your transformation into Ghelzonianses?
Uh, no, I...
Especially this evening.
At twilight, my heart will pound like a hammer...
Be still, my arm!
Understood. Leave it to me.
Not yet! It's too soon!
Dekomori will join you in battle!
Be destroyed, real.
Blow up, synapses.
Banishment, This World!
You came, Wicked Lord Shingan.
Forgive me. I cannot seem to control myself.
Is the Dark Flame Dragon...
Avalon Smasher!
Wait!
Where is Dekomori?
She vanished!
Did she fall through the loophole of the parallel world?
She just kind of ran from the room...
This is bad!
Don't!
We must do something before the Dark Flame Dragon overtakes you!
Avalon Smasher!
Wait! Wait!
Yuta, hold still. This will require careful aim.
I'll be going now.
Her classroom is next.
I hope that Togashi is keeping her in check like I asked.
Yes! She isn't here! Thank you, Togashi!
2-4 Shinka Nibutani
Pleased to meet you.
My name is Shinka Nibutani from Year Two...
I am here today to present my candidacy.
This really takes me back.
This was my classroom last year.
On the day of the entrance ceremony
I actually came to this classroom by mistake.
Okay, the connection is made.
Now all I have to do is impress them with my dependability.
Anyway, I can be a bit of a scatterbrain...
U-um, well...
Well, I love my school more than...
I hope for your honest vote...
Ow!
Your honest vote for Shinka Nibutani.
Thank you for...
Togashi!
You're blaming me?!
Of course I am!
To add insult to injury...
Watch what you say!
Kumin-senpai, I wish you wouldn't leak incorrect information.
But you were trying to summon the Dark Flame Dragon.
Going Ooh! Aah! the whole time.
Enough of the impersonations.
I will not allow an imposter to rule the campus!
You guys are disturbing the other patrons.
Rikka, make Dekomori stop.
That was close.
Order yours without in the first place!
Hero?
Shichimiya!
Stop that!
Sorry, I couldn't help it.
Shichimiya?
Sophia!
Mori Summer! Long time no see!
You go to the same school as Hero.
Are you 1,216 years old now?
Are you the Devil?!
W-w-who might you be?
My name is Catherine Suzuki.
You chose to be a half?!
So you transferred to the middle school Nibutani was attending?
Yeah. As a magician who has lived for 1,200 years,
Mori Summer fought in this world alongside the magical devil girl.
Don't worry.
As long as you abide by the teachings in the Mabinogion...
Really?!
Yes, so you must pray.
I made this crystal potion for you.
Wow, thank you!
Sophia, I am sure the angel is nearby.
Yes!
Stop!
Stop it, Nibutani! The wall is innocent.
I guess that means that you're really Mori Summer, Mori Summer.
Be wary, Kumin.
The magical devil girl has been known to use illusion.
Exactly! She couldn't possibly be the true one.
What? But Mori Summer is 100 Mori Summer.
I declare it to be so on Satan's name. Look!
Would you look at that!
Stop it!
Are you really still doing that stuff at your age?
Grow out of it already.
The magical devil girl is eternal!
The words Grow out of it are not in my dictionary!
It's really her?
No, this isn't enough to determine her legitimacy.
Mori Summer is far more noble...
Th-this hand accessory.
It's the same!
The multicolored gemstones are unmistakable.
Which means...
Huh?
My name is Sanae Dekomori.
I am a Year One student at Icho Private High School.
In this world, I am 15 years and 8 months old.
Morning, Deko!
Oh, good morning!
We start out with Phys Ed.
Yes. Mornings are difficult due to lowered magical power.
I have been proactive in the battle
in the parallel world as my master's servant...
Magic?
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry, I must go ahead.
Um, sure.
Yes, until my chance encounter...
Mistress Mori Summer!
Good morning!
Morning.
Mistress Mori Summer?
Dekomori respects Mori Summer only second to myself.
Naturally, she calls her Mistress.
I told you, Deko.
I can't tell people who I really am...
You're right. Very well, Nibutani-senpai.
Yes, well done.
Now I, Dekomori, must head to class.
I will come to see you on my breaks, Moris...
I mean, Nibutani-senpai!
I'm amazed!
I guess, but it's exhausting.
She keeps coming to see me on every single break.
Wouldn't she obey you if you told her to keep her distance?
I tried already. This is what happened.
Mistress Mori Summer... Mistress Mori Summer, do you...
Do you not like me anymore?
Um, no, it's not that.
Why does she have to cry? That girl is way too edgy.
I just knew it, Mori Summer. You do like Dekomori.
What makes you say that?
But won't this make the student council election easier to do?
Well, sure, she'll probably listen to me if I ask her not to interfere.
Student Council Election Special Edition
Not that. Ask her to help you...
Remember how she said she was popular with the freshmen?
Dekomori is an excellent servant.
As her master, I would be willing...
But if you did that...
I see. This is my chance to ask her to assist me.
What?
Of course! Please allow me to assist you!
Really?
Yes! For I know.
Mistress Mo... I mean, Nibutani-senpai.
Once you are president,
you will convert this school to Shangri-La protected by the spirits
as it is recorded in the Mabinogion.
Keep that secret! Everyone will find out who I really am.
Yes, you're right.
So can I count on your help then?
Yes, ma'am!
Good afternoon, everyone.
I am Shinka Nibutani, and I am a candidate for president of the student council.
Thank you for your support! I will make three promises to you,
to make your student life even better.
I am Makoto Isshiki, and I am a candidate for president of the student council.
Vote for Makoto Isshiki!
Now, it is done.
Wow, you're good at artwork too.
I Am Serious About Your Future - SHINKA NIBUTANI
Nibutani-senpai's poster is kind of sublime.
You can tell how much Deko respects her by looking at it.
Yeah, for sure.
Yay!
Thank you. I owe it all to you, Deko.
I never dreamed I would get so much freshman support.
Yes, ma'am! You have a 70 approval rating!
When did you guys become such good friends?
I-I didn't do anything.
What are you saying? I, Dekomori and Mistress Mori Summer...
Isn't that right, Mistress Mori Summer?
What? Uh, yes. That's right.
Dekomori, the moon looks blue tonight.
We will summon the demon beast and go hunting together.
Really?
But...
I am terribly sorry!
Today, I have an important meeting to attend with Mistress Mori Summer.
I will accompany you on the very next opportunity, I swear!
Sorry about that. Well, let's get going.
Yes, ma'am. Goodbye.
Togashi?
Oh, brother.
Rikka?
All right. I'll look at it with you.
Really?
But only after you've done your homework.
For some reason, you say the same things as the Priestess.
Are you in collusion?
No!
So, this is your room, Mistress Mori Summer?
It looks very common.
Mistress Mori Summer, do you keep your
true identity secret from your family?
Y-yes.
And you can bear the loneliness? I am impressed.
Th-thanks.
Now, about my campaign speech for the all-candidates' debate...
Yes, I am halfway through writing it.
Yes, this should work.
Thank you so much!
Also, um...
I made cookies.
Hey, is this me?
Yes.
D-do you like them?
These are good.
Really?!
What a relief.
I didn't notice it through all of her spiteful comments...
She might actually be really nice.
LOCKED AWAY
My name is Mori Summer.
I am a magician who has lived for 400 years.
I have heard the whisperings of the spirits,
and have come to grant you my council.
Mistress Mori Summer...
I finally met you.
What is it that troubles you?
Please confide in me.
Deko, no cell pics.
Just one photo.
Please allow me this one photo of your glorious presence.
Deko.
I beg you! Just this one photo!
Just this one!
Oh, all right.
Mistress Mori Summer!
Master!
Master... Master...
I'm sorry about everything till now. C'mon, stop crying.
Appear to me, Demon Beast!
Reveal to me the resting place that I seek!
At this rate, Nibutani really is gonna win the election.
President of the student council.
President of the student council?
Shichimiya?
Are you the Demon Beast? Yuta, stand back!
Hey, no pulling!
Yuta, the bath is ready.
85TH ANNUAL STUDENT COUNCIL ELECTION ALL-CANDIDATES DEBATE
A man always strives to reach the top!
A man always has ambition!
I, Makoto Isshiki, will go to the top to be your dictator!
Thank you!
85TH ANNUAL STUDENT COUNCIL ELECTION ALL-CANDIDATES DEBATE
Isshiki, where are you going with that?
We're next. Are you nervous?
Did you remember to bring the draft?
I'm fine! I have the draft right here.
Yesterday, I revised the previous version of the speech
to convey your information to the masses with more accuracy...
85TH ANNUAL STUDENT COUNCIL ELECTION SHINKA NIBUTANI SUPPORT SPEECH Sanae Dekomori
Now the draft carries a much more powerful message.
What? Oh.
Next up is Miss Sanae Dekomori, who is Shinka Nibutani's campaign speech manager.
Here! I'm going in.
Candidate for President of the Student Council, Year Two, Shinka Nibutani
Good afternoon.
I am Sanae Dekomori, and I am Shinka Nibutani's campaign speech manager.
I will now convey the words spoken by Mistress Mori Summer...
Chapter one, paragraph three.
The world is composed of love's divine providence.
85TH ANNUAL STUDENT COUNCIL ELECTION ALL-CANDIDATES DEBATE
I have spent the last 400 years
observing the internal workings of the hearts of mankind.
War. Hate. Strife.
I can't help but wonder why mankind continues these actions?
Join me, everyone.
The spirits are always nearby delivering their love!
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Senpai? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Nibutani...
The critical hit?
85TH ANNUAL STUDENT COUNCIL ELECTION RESULTS: PRESIDENT: Hitomi Ubushiro
DROPOUT: Shinka Nibutani, Makoto Isshiki, Kenta Tanaka
Nibu didn't come today?
I think she stayed home.
Far-East Magical Napping Society - Summer Thereof
I nearly fell for her deception!
Just like that?!
Of course!
The Mabinogion is gospel!
The words of this book caused her to suffer!
Proof that she is an imposter!
Exactly.
You are the only master for me, Master.
My master!
My servant!
Good for them.
This is good?
Nibutani?
She's gloomy.
Give that back.
You showed yourself, imposter!
Shut up! That Mabinogion is to blame for everything!
Hand it over!
Do not talk righteously to me, imposter!
Just hand it over!
I will never give it to an imposter!
Milk - Full Of Calcium
Just give it up already! Got it?!
Stop! Stop it!
It's much more relaxing this way.
You find this relaxing?
Now hand it over!
