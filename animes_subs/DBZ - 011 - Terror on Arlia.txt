All right, then!
What, you again? You never learn, do you?
Over here!
Well then, I'll be taking some meat again!
Your tail is going to disappear before long.
Looks like you've gotten a little bit better.
Wow, to think that Kami- sama is going to be training us!
Damn, I'm just itching all over!
Take it easy, take it easy.
In any case, we have to find Tenshinhan and Chaozu.
Those two are going to be so surprised!
Yamucha- sama, after you and everyone else have Kami- sama make you stronger,
those Saiyans will be nothing to you!
That's for sure! If you're coming, then bring it on, Saiyans!
Wake up, Nappa! Wake up! Open your eyes, Nappa!
Have we arrived at Earth already?
No, not yet. I thought we might stop off on the way, and set my wake-up timer.
Stop off somewhere, you say?
There's a pretty good planet ahead of us. We can sell it for a lot!
Understood.
Sleeping for one year straight gets you all out of form, so this will be perfect!
W- what is this?
You're sure we can sell a place like this for a high price?
In any event...
What ugly creatures those are!
They look like they're space men.
To think that we would come across space men on our hunt!
I'm sure that Moai- sama will be pleased!
Moai?
This planet's king! Our ruler!
You've come all the way from outer space. Stay here for a while!
This will be interesting!
Stop, Nappa.
This could be an opportunity. Let's let them introduce us to this Moai.
Here...
Don't scare us like that!
Freeze, you bank robber!
You're under arrest!
What pests!
This money is a present for Ten- san! You guys stay out of it!
Just you wait, Tenshinhan!
I'll feed you all kinds of nutritious things with this money!
Behave yourselves for a little while now, space men.
It looks like quite an enjoyable little planet, huh?
I- it's true! You're space men! I've never seen any before!
Never mind, he's now finally started reaching out after space men.
How far is he going to go before he's satisfied?
You have come to this planet at a bad time.
Ever since Moai has claimed the throne, things have been crazy.
Everyone in the general population has become Moai's toys!
And as for me, I had my wife stolen from me on our wedding day!
Do you understand how I feel?
Oh, my adorable Lemuria!
What's the matter, Lemuria?
Nothing special...
Don't tell me you're still thinking about that other man.
Please, stop! Spare me!
L- let me out!
I beg you! P- please, I beg you!
D- don't eat me! Please! I- I don't want to die!
I'm bored.
What? You say you've captured some space men?
Yes.
Interesting. Bring them here. If they're cute, I'll make them my pets.
What is this?
C- could they be the ones?
I- it's them! How did they get out of the prison?
I- incredible...
W- what power those guys have!
What ugly creatures! There's no way I can keep them as pets.
Right, Lemuria?
Hey, space men! How would you like to make a wager with me?
Wager?
Have a go at fighting against my warriors.
If you win, I'll give you anything you like.
Although, no matter how you look at it, there's no chance of you beating them.
I'd like to see what kind of blood is spilled by space men. Go!
W- what? What the hell's going on here?
You said you'd give us anything we liked, right?
In that case...
What!?
Didn't you hear him? We're taking this planet, and your lives!
I- impossible!
Don't you get it yet? We let ourselves be captured on purpose.
In order for us to be led in here, you see.
Kill them! Cut them to bits!
Ain't I at Kaio- sama's place yet!?
Yedi! Release Yedi!
So this monster is your ace in the hole, huh?
Let them have it, Yedi! Kill those two!
May I?
Suit yourself.
Fool! You intend to test your strength against Yedi's!?
Y- Yedi!
I'm done playing around!
W- what's this?
I- incredible! You guys are incredible!
You are indeed the saviors of this planet!
Peace is sure to return to this planet now, just as it was before!
Atla!
Atla!
L- Lemuria?
This is hopeless. We won't be able to get squat for this planet.
Let's go, Nappa.
Atla!
Get out of my sight, you good-for-nothing planet!
Lemuria!
Atla!
They're beautiful when they're obliterated, no matter what planet they happen to be.
Still, I hope this Earth turns out to be a little bit better of a planet than this.
Hey, if it turns out to be another good-for-nothing planet,
we'll just blow it away too.
After we've gathered those Dragon Ball things, that is.
Eternal life, huh? I'm looking forward to that!
Such terrible, heartless Saiyans! ls there any future for earth?
Elsewhere, Goku single-mindedly continues to run in order to meet Kaio-sama.
This sure is long!
