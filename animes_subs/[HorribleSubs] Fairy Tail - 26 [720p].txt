Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
During the initial confrontations with Phantom Lord,
Master and Erza were defeated!
In order for us to stop the Magic Giant,
we have to defeat the Element 4.
And by the way, Lucy, who is being targeted by Phantom,
was hidden away in the safe-house, but...
I've got a bad feeling about this.
It'll be all right! I'll yell it out countless times.
I believe your every tomorrow will be shining.
The intersection of all people
Never giving up. And that's why we're not gonna lose!
When it seems like you'll be blown away by the headwinds,
grasp this hand, try to take a chance.
Because you're not alone anymore, got it?
Go forward, more and more!
Don't give up on your awesome dream!
That's right, don't cry!
Move on, my way!
Now, with the light shining down upon you.
Don't even think about something like giving up!
Even if you trade being hurt again for strength.
Your eyes, always looking straight ahead,
can surely see the light!
Wow, you're right!
The Magic Giant's writing speed has slowed down considerably, right?
So that's it.
Fire, water, wind, and earth.
A Magic Giant that moves using the power of the four elements.
And the source of that magical power is the Element 4.
Totomaru of the Conflagration, who was guarding Jupiter.
Sol of the Land, who Elfman defeated.
And there's Juvia of the Deep, who Gray defeated.
Then that means there's only one left.
If we can defeat that fourth member, we can stop the giant.
Which means we can stop them from casting Abyss Break.
The final one, Aria of the Heavens.
The strongest wizard of the Element 4.
And he's the one who took the master's magical power! He's a fearsome opponent.
My imagination?
Wings of Flame!
You hold up quite well, Salamander.
I'm all fired up, you bastard!
Natsu...
Airspace... Suppress!
He's too strong!
So this is the strongest man in the Element 4!
Damn it...
There's always someone better, young dragon...
Then how about this?
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
He disappeared!
Where'd he go?
This is over, Salamander.
Let me give you the same suffering I gave to Makarov...
Airspace... Ruin!
The sadness!
No matter the wizard, inside this airspace their magical power will empty!
My power...
Natsu!
Damn it all...
Erza!
Hey, is it okay for you to move with that injury?
Erza's angry!
He's the one who did that to the master?
Erza Scarlet?
How sad.
For me to have the head of not only Salamander, but Titania as well!
So you're the bastard who laid hands on him. He's like a father to us!
Erza!
Since I get to actually face Erza...
His eyes?
Yes.
What about his eyeballs?
Aria usually has his eyes closed.
By closing his eyes he suppresses the overwhelming magical power he possesses, it seems.
What?
Anyway, if you find Aria, beat him before he can open his eyes!
If he opens them, you might lose any chance at victory.
What's that?
The magic circle is glowing!
Is it complete?
Damn it... Is this as far as we go?
Natsu... Everyone...
I'm counting on you!
Come, Titania!
Activate the Airspace of Death, Zero!
This Airspace will consume all life within it!
This isn't good at all!
Magic that consumes life?
How? How can you take people's lives so easily?
You villain!
Now, let's enjoy this!
Erza!
Can you withstand this Airspace?
Impossible!
She's slicing through the Airspace?!
Heaven's Wheel!
Blumenblatt!
She beat him in one hit!
Erza's dangerous, that's for sure!
The likes of you should never have been able to beat the master.
Your days of glory will be wiped out, starting now.
T-The sadness...
Can we block it?
It's not something blockable!
What should we do?
What?
The light's disappeared!
Erza!
Hey!
What's this?
Is this Natsu's doing?
It's stopped!
Abyss Break has been terminated!
Seriously?
Which means...
The power of the four elements has been cut off.
They did it!
The giant has been stopped!
The Element 4 are defeated?
I knew they could do it.
Reedus, are you okay?
Oui...
Quite the stubborn one.
Hey there, Double Stuf, it's about time you gave up and handed that girl over.
Our master is waiting, you see.
Lucy, hurry up and run.
What are you saying? I'll fight too!
It's for everyone's sake!
Please!
But...
Oh, you're makin' me cry.
How touching.
I like it.
Pict Magic!
Roar of Silver!
Oh, it's Vulcans! I've seen them on Mt. Hakobe.
Mirror Magic!
Form Mirror!
Any hostility is reflected by these mirrors.
See ya!
Reedus!
I'm sorry!
Leaving your ally and running away, Princess?
You Fairy Butts ain't so hot after all.
If they'd let somebody like you join!
Why, you...
You wanna go?
Sound Attack!
Howling!
Reedus!
How weak... You actually like hanging out with these guys, Princess?
Why, you... You...
You'll never...
What's going on? Did they stop the giant?
Now that's what I call a greeting!
What have you done to Lucy?
Return the girl at once.
Or else...
I'll erase you from this world!
Perfect. I've been looking to have some fun.
I'll take you on!
Loke...
What's with the strange vibes I'm getting from him?
He's not just some Holder-type wizard, is he?
Who the hell are you?
You smell weird.
Don't smell me.
I'd rather not be sniffed by guys.
Not now!
My imagination?
He was totally weak!
Bozu, Sue, I'm heading back.
Clean up that lady-killer there.
Roger that...
I won't let you...
Sound Attack!
Disturbed!
Mirror Magic!
Kaleidoscope!
It's impossible for you to escape from there for a while.
Have a good look at your own pitiful form.
Unbelievable.
Those Element 4 were wiped out fighting that worthless Fairy Tail?
If you're beat by trash, then you're trash yourself.
Oh, you've returned, Gajeel?
I've brought a present, Master.
That was quick.
But you did an excellent job finding her, Gajeel.
Don't underestimate the nose of a Dragon Slayer.
You're sure she's still alive?
This is all pointless if she isn't.
I did rough her up a lot.
See?
Looks like she's still kickin'!
Now that's my guild. Only the strongest wizards.
Attention all you from Fairy Tail.
Please listen carefully to this voice.
What's this?
It's Master Jose!
That voice!
It's Lucy!
Oh, no!
We have captured Lucy.
So, we have accomplished one of our objectives.
Thus we have one final goal that remains to be fulfilled.
Wiping you off the face of this earth!
You worthless brats!
Damn him!
I'm sorry, Lucy... I wasn't able to protect you...
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
I knew something bad would happen...
And yet...
Why didn't I come earlier?
No... I was scared...
Lucy, scared to be close to you!
I'm the worst!
Seriously... I really do look pitiful.
Isn't that right, Karen?
What is it now?
I think the number of Shades has increased!
Give us a break here... They're still at it?
Watch over Lucy.
There are a number of bugs still in my guild building.
Salamander, too?
Yes.
However...
I'll show them there won't be any more miracles...
I'll clean them up myself!
Damn it! Lucy's been...
Natsu...
Erza!
Unleash...
You have... power... sleeping within you...
Believe in yourself...
Break though...
And call it forth!
Now is the time...
Protect Lucy...
Protect the guild!
Go, Natsu!
You're the one who will surpass me!
Natsu, huh?
Makarov...
How do you feel?
You should stay in bed.
And you think I'll listen to you?
Considering your age, don't you think it's a bit early for you to have recovered?
The age crack wasn't necessary.
You going to your death?
I'm going to do my duty as a parent. That's all.
Sorry for the trouble.
Honestly...
You never change.
Erza!
Erza!
Looks like there were some fireworks here too.
It's you guys.
When did you break in?
You shouldn't even be standing!
H-Hey!
Aria?
You actually fought with wounds like that?
What were you thinking?
Which means...
You defeated Aria?
I never wanted you to see me so weak like this...
I guess I still have a long way to go.
What's that?
That's...
I sense death!
What is this feeling?
It sends chills down a Man's spine!
The malice is palpable!
My, my. I'm quite impressed, my Fairy Tail Wizards...
To think I would be able to have such fun... I never would have dreamed it.
Destroying Jupiter, taking down the Element 4...
And even bringing my Magic Giant to its knees!
Master Jose!
This guy's...
What incredible evil magical power!
I feel nauseous just standing near him!
Now, I must thank you for the fun you've given me.
Elfman!
Right!
I'll enjoy this...
Ice Make...
Beast Arm!
Wait, don't be hasty!
Saucer!
Iron Bull!
Absurd!
Elfman, Gray!
You. I'm pretty sure you took a direct hit from Jupiter.
How is it you can stand?
My friends strengthen my heart!
For those that I love...
Strong, courageous, beautiful...
It will be such a pleasure to destroy you, girl!
Not too bad a sound.
But man, what a lame reaction...
Gajeel, don't you think you should stop now?
You keep doing this, and it'll be serious trouble!
But I'm bored.
The master sure is cruel.
Making me watch over the girl like this,
and going to deal with the flies himself.
What's the harm in doing this to pass the time, huh?
Stop it. If the master finds out, he won't let you off so easy!
Shut up.
Maybe she's some noblewoman or something, but to me she's nothing but Fairy Butt trash.
And even if she's a woman, she's still a Wizard.
She should be prepared for this when she joined a guild.
But you're going overboard.
What a waste...
Master's gonna be pissed, big time.
If that happens, I'll blame it on you guys.
What a jerk...
But man, how stupid.
Now that they know she's rich, the Fairy Butts are frantic to get her back.
You guys really are complete idiots.
So pitiful... I think I'm tearing up.
What is she thinking?
She's provoking Gajeel.
Phantom Lord? The rulers of spirits?
What a joke! I'm not scared of you at all!
Oh, I see then.
You've got some balls bluffing in a situation like this.
I must say that's not bad...
But, you see... What I want to hear isn't your backtalk.
I want to hear you scream.
You don't start yelling and there's going to be trouble.
Then why don't you try killing me?
You do that, and you'll be in bigger trouble.
Well, that sounds interesting.
Let me hear it.
Fairy Tail would never forgive you.
That's the kind of guild they are!
You'd be shivering under the shadow of the world's scariest guild every day...
For the rest of your lives!
That sounds like fun, too.
Let's try that out!
Gajeel!
Stop it!
I knew it.
I noticed your smell!
Salamander!
Gajeel!
The Iron Dragon Slayer... So that means he eats iron, right?
Probably.
Just like you eat fire, Natsu, he should eat his element.
Then couldn't you become the Fish Dragon Slayer, Happy?
Fish Dragon?
That might be kinda cool!
Next time: The Two Dragon Slayers!
What would the Roar of the Fish Dragon be like?
You'd shoot fish or something from your mouth...
That's not really me...
