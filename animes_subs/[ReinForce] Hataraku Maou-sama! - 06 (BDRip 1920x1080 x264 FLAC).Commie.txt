Intro
Mwahaha.
How's it feel to be so helpless?
To be burnt to a crisp?
Milord.
I will feed on your flesh, guts, and even your very bones,
and they'll sustain me to further my ambitions!
No.
If you'd just listen, Milord...
It is time for the feast to begin!
The first one to be offered in sacrifice to me...
shall be you!
Milord!
What do you want, Ashiya?
Try not to make such a scene while eating.
You're bothering the other customers.
My bad.
I got a bit too excited.
But can you blame me? Offal's delicious.
I finally understand what the other demons meant when they said the guts were to die for!
Good for you.
But...
Don't just eat meat. Have some vegetables too.
You should maintain a balanced diet.
Oh, come on.
We're supposed to be celebrating my promotion tonight.
Oh, by the way...
Shouldn't we get Urushihara's dinner while we're at it?
Looks like they have barbecue sets for takeout.
There's no need.
It seems Urushihara learned how to do this online shopping thing recently.
He's been wasting too much of our money.
Huh?
You must bring the hammer of judgment down on him.
OP
Get out of your cage
Fly toward the sky
Fly toward the sky
It all starts right here, right now
Let's picture what we can do
Let's picture what we can do
Let's picture what we can do
Unbelievable things might happen
But we can overcome them all
But we can overcome them all
But we can overcome them all
Power of dreams
Power of dreams
Power of dreams
Our dreams are born from nothing
And take us to that shining sky
fly
And take us to that shining sky
And take us to that shining sky
And take us to that shining sky
Light blue wind
Light blue wind
I want to spread my wings
Now here I go, with the greatest smile on my face
Now here I go, with the greatest smile on my face
Now here I go, with the greatest smile on my face
Now here I go, with the greatest smile on my face
Let's set out to an unknown world
Let's set out to an unknown world
Let's set out to an unknown world
Let's set out to an unknown world
Go to another world
We'll be the ones to choose and decide the future
Let's chase after our dreams
There will be times when we cry
I have a really important wish
Don't fade away
I'm sure you'll be able to meet your future self
I'm sure you'll be able to meet your future self
I'm sure you'll be able to meet your future self
Get out of your cage

Part A
Did you just say Olba disappeared?
Indeed. It seems Hero Emilia is still alive in another world.
What?
That's not all.
Looks like the Overlord is still alive as well.
The Overlord too?
But Olba said she disappeared along with Better Half
after a fierce battle at Castle Overlord.
He was lying through his teeth.
Emerada and Albert's capture
was Lord Olba's doing as well.
What?
As for Emerada,
her return to St. Isle's already been confirmed.
We've received word that she's trying to
expose Emilia's status and Lord Olba's defection.
Defection? A High Priest, defect?!
Calm down, Lord Robertio!
Enough with your outrageous reports!
But it's the truth.
A royal magician of St. Isle
officially announcing that Emilia is alive...
We can't disregard the kind of effect that'll have.
It contradicts the Church's announcement that she died.
So what'll you do?
What do you mean?
Will you admit that a High Priest defected?
Or will you eliminate Emerada, Albert, and Emilia?
That's absurd.
That very absurdity
is what we inquisitors have been perpetuating this whole time.
And it was all of you who gave the orders, was it not?
What about you?
What would you choose?
We're back.
You're late!
I'm starving!
Milord's letting you stay here out of the goodness of his heart, you know.
Here you go.
For you, Urushihara.
Hey!
Didn't you two go to a barbecue place?
Why'd you get me a pork bowl from Sugiya?!
We set up that PC and internet connection for you.
How much do you think that cost?
Stop whining.
I can't eat a PC!
Then gather up all the information about magic that exists in this world for Milord.
Depending on the results,
your pork bowl could go from a medium to a large,
maybe even an extra large!
That's it?! An extra-large pork bowl?!
But Urushihara...
Can you really use this PC thing?
Oh, you don't believe me?
Allow me to show you, then.
Ugh...
Just as I'm about to get off work, too...
Thank you for calling.
This is Docodemo's Customer Care Center.
You're speaking to Yusa.
Whoa, it connected!
Holy crap! You're awesome, Urushihara!
Huh?
Hey, Emi! Can you hear me?
M-Maou...
What do you think you're doing?
I'm still at work, you know!
Don't get so mad.
It's just a hacking experiment.
Urushihara said he could do all sorts of things if he had a PC. so I bought him one.
It was the first time I used a credit card to buy something expensive in installments.
There're so many questions I want to ask, but first...
Who the hell's Urushihara?
Lucifer.
What?!
What do you mean, Lucifer?!
Don't tell me he's staying at Castle Overlord
Later.
Sorry I disturbed you.
Thank you very much!
You're incredible, Maou.
You haven't even been working for a year,
but you've already been made a shift manager!
Really?
Still, I'm just a stand-in manager for when the real one isn't around.
Oh, but wait...
Does that mean that for a limited time, even if it's only a small number of people,
you get to rule over humans?
I won't let that happen.
Emi!
We need to talk.
I'm working, as you can see.
Save it for later.
And who was it that first prank-called me when I was working?
U-Um...
Would you like to try our promotional JalapeNo Fries?
Yeah, I can't play any online games with these specs.
Oh, how I want to play a game.
Hm?
Tokyo Suburbs Scary Spots!! Shibuya Edition
The Seven Mysteries of Sasahata North High... The Forbidden Classroom, etc. Koushuu Highway's Jet Geezer
Isn't this...
Cappadocia?
We can't discount the possibility that this is a sign
a lesser demon once fell to this world and lived there.
If that's true, then we might be able to replenish our magic.
But traveling to Turkey?
I wonder how many months Milord would have to work to pay for that.
From the landlord?
Good work.
Well?
What's up, Emi?
Don't give me that!
What was up with that call you made yesterday?!
Like I said, it was Urushihara's doing.
Why're you calling Lucifer Urushihara?
Well, Olba got taken in by the cops after what happened,
so Lucifer shouldn't be out and about.
I figured I might as well let him stay at my place.

There's nothing we can do about it.
I'm running on fumes now.
I couldn't go back to Ente Isla even if I wanted to.
Well, I can go back any time I want.
I don't even need to look for ways to replenish my sacred powers in order to control the gate.
Then why don't you just go back already?
I-I'm a hero!
As long as you stay here in Japan,
I have to watch over you!
Ah, what a pain in the ass.

Hey, I'm back.
Urushihara!
Pull yourself together!
Who did this to you?!
M-Milord...
You mustn't... look at that...
You mustn't... look at that...
A photo of the landlord in a swimsuit?
Yes.
It seems she's currently in Hawaii.
There was a picture enclosed of her frolicking in the waves at Waikiki Beach.
Unbelievable!
What the hell did you make me look at?!
That kinda stuff needs to be properly censored!
Pathetic.
How could two demons be shaken up by something like that?
Then take a look at it yourself!
That aside, Urushihara.
Have you got your hands on any information related to magic?
Hey!
You're dodging the topic!
You just dodged the topic, didn't you?!
Milord did nothing of the sort.
Sometimes, it's necessary to courageously retreat.
Courageously retreat, my ass.
But whatever.
This is good timing.
I did find something interesting.
Tokyo Suburbs Scary Spots!! Shibuya Edition
What does that have to do with magic?
Magical hot spots in this world
aren't just limited to the pyramids, Stone Henge, and the like.
You can find tons nearby if you know where to look.
But obviously, you won't find that information at the library.
This place here is the most likely candidate.
The Seven Mysteries of Sasahata North High... hKoushuu Highway's Jet Geezer
A forbidden classroom?
Yup.
There's a classroom in one of the school's defunct buildings.
Apparently, you can hear whispering, laughter, and footsteps there at night.
If I had to guess,
it's quite likely a demon's involved in all this.

Is this the school in question?
It seems surprisingly cheery.
I doubt there's really a place here that has something to do with magic.
I can't sense anything from here.
Either way,
it won't be easy for us outsiders to enter the school grounds.
Maou!
Sasaki?!
Oh.
Here I was, thinking the school name sounded familiar.
It was Chiho's school all along?
Sasacchi...
Is that the guy from MgRonald's you told me about?
Yup! He's Maou!
And who's the guy with him?
Ashiya, his roommate.
Roommate?!
Two guys can live in a six-tatami-mat apartment?!
And there's only one bed?!
Wait.
It's not like that!
Why're you imagining all that stuff?!
Hey, stop it!
Looks like they're having a fun conversation.
What could they be talking about?
A forbidden classroom?
Yeah.
I heard it was one of your school's seven mysteries.
Yeah, it's pretty famous.
Like, people have heard a monster's moans from inside a room
or have seen the windows reflect the image of a demon and stuff.
That wasn't you, was it?
Nah. Wasn't me.
But Ente Isla might have something to do with it.
So I figured I'd investigate it.
Got it, Maou!
Leave it to me!
This is the old school building.
But what about the forbidden classroom?
Hell, it's just a rumor,
but a long time ago, before I was even born,
there was an incident where a student disappeared from that room like they'd been spirited away.
And it hasn't been used since.
Oh, wanna take a break here and eat some snacks?
This isn't a picnic, you know.
You look like you're having fun, Chiho.
Well, you're always helping me out, be it at work or elsewhere.
I'm really happy I could help you out this time around.
Aren't you scared?
No, because you're with me...
Oh.
Anyway, it's called the seven mysteries, right?
What're the others like?
Huh?
Oh, uh...
The northern staircase has a different number of steps depending on if you walk up or down.
The bloody Ninomiya Kinjirou statue walks.
The sculpture in the art room grows double eyelids at 3 AM.
There's a dictionary in the library in which only the word curse is highlighted in red.

The piano in the music room sometimes stops playing the C note.
That only adds up to six, though.
Nobody knows the seventh one.
Because when you find out about all seven of them...
When you find out?
Wh-What happens?
You get a call from Hell on your cellphone and have your soul taken away!
Incoming
That's just ridiculous.
Why do you get your soul taken away just for finding out?
What if you found out by accident?
Calm down, Milord.
I mean, the story of the forbidden classroom dates back to before Sasaki was born.
Why would that story include a cellphone?
Yeah...

What the fuck, Urushihara?!
Don't scare me like that!
What are you screaming for?
Well? Have you reached the forbidden classroom yet?
Not yet!
What do you want, anyway?!
By the way,
I think the forbidden classroom's a place where a gate was opened in the past.
A gate?
Yeah.
The atmosphere becomes unstable where a gate's been opened,
which makes it easier for subsequent gates to open there.
Does that mean the story about a student being spirited away...
It's quite likely they got dragged into the gate.
Anyway, if you manage to be there the next time a gate opens up,
then you might be able to replenish your powers.
Call me once you get there.
Later.
Just how did Urushihara find all that out?
The internet's amazing!
Did you hear that?
Could it be a security guard?
They shouldn't be here at this hour either.
So what, it's an otherworldly monster that came from the gate?
It's not scary at all if we know that beforehand.
Bring it on.
You say that like you have enough magic to fight.
If you must, use this.
What the?
Demonic power.
We demons have already experienced firsthand how powerful it is.
Isn't that the landlord's
Footsteps...
What do you plan on doing by bringing a high school girl here at night?
Emi!
I see.
So you were scheming to gain some magic from that forbidden classroom, eh?
Wait. What are you doing here at this hour?
Trespassing hero, are we?
I'm sorry,
but you can't wear outdoor shoes in school.
Could you put these on instead?
I was tailing you and saw you sneaking into the school,
so of course I'd follow you inside.
Anyway, I'll be accompanying you.
I can't just let you guys replenish your powers
Hey, Maou!
Are you sure about leaving Yusa behind, Maou?
Yeah.
Nothing good happens when she's involved.
Hold it right there, Maou!
Aw, jeez. What a pain!
Wait!
Dammit, Maou! I'm gonna kick you when I catch you!
I'll kick your ass!
Huh?
What's wrong, Chiho?
N-Nothing...
There you are, monster!
All right!
Like hell it is, you idiot!
Yusa, that's called an anatomical model. It's just a mannequin!
Huh?
A hero who used their sacred sword to smash an anatomical model to bits?
The universe is vast, but Emilia's probably the only one.
Who the hell just whips out their sacred sword and swings it around?
You'd better do something about this.
These things are expensive, aren't they?
Well, I've got nothing to do with this.
N-Nobody'll find out if we keep it a secret...
Just kidding. We can't have that, obviously.
It's your guys' fault for sneaking in here at night, anyway!
Give it up, Emilia.
Do something about it with your powers!
Why do I have to pick up your shit with my valuable powers?
This model...
only has one heart!
Ashiya...
I don't know how it works for demons,
but humans only have one heart!
So the forbidden classroom lies beyond here?
Just put your sacred sword away.
Don't bring it out until I give the okay.
You're not the boss of me!
That's the old school building.
We'll have to climb the stairs to get to the forbidden classroom.
It's on the third floor.
All right.
Let's go.
Is this the forbidden classroom?
I don't remember these planks being nailed here, though.
Put your sacred sword away already.
What's wrong, Ashiya?
This door has signs of having been used recently.
It's not fixed?
So this door actually opens?
It somehow feels like someone's been living here.
It really doesn't seem like a classroom that was forbidden for ages.
Is that...
URUSHIHARA
URUSHIHARA
URUSHIHARA
What do you want, Urushihara?
Did you get there?
We just got here.
Stop calling for every little thing.
It's scary!
Did you find anything there?
Like...
a game console, for example.
Yeah, we did.
We're holding it right now.
Damn. So it really was there.
Really?
Huh?
Oh, it's nothing.
Sorry, but could you bring that with you?
Urushihara...
Did you...
Wh-What?
You said this was a place where it'd be easy to open a gate,
but could this be the place where you and Olba landed up?
That's right.
Didn't I tell you?
First I've heard of it!
Anyway, Olba and me stayed there for a while,
but I left the console I was using back then.
Urushihara...
Did you do all this just so we could pick this up for you?
I wouldn't dream of it!
I was just wondering if somebody opened a gate there and showed up.
So did you find anything?
If you didn't, hurry up and come back.
I'm starving!
A pork bowl's fine with me.
Urushihara's one cheeky cunt.
What say we sell this console off?
It'll cover a bit of our living expenses.
Just how petty are you?
U don
U don
Udon?
What a waste of time and effort that was.
Huh?
Oh, Maou.
I found that lying in...
Maou?!
Get a hold of yourself, Maou!
Give it back!
That's mine!
Keep the gaming to one hour a day.
Be grateful we didn't sell it off!
Huh?
Huh?
Did someone move in?
Look out!
Y-You okay?
Milord, are you okay?
Well, no, she kinda fell down the stairs.
Unpreparedness is one's greatest enemy.
What?
ED
Where in this silent sky does the sun rise?
A promise I made while pretending to not see it
The moon that got ridiculed
Will disappear towards the past
Being a liar and a coward
If I was at fault for everything
Then our promise might only have been a fleeting dream
I managed to hide it in the shadow of the moonlight
But I was actually crying
My tears won't flow anymore
They've dried up
If I was able to let everything go
I might be able to cry again
But this world is full of things I want to protect
