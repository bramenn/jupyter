All right. Where's this famous Fuchsia Gym we're looking for anyway?
I can't believe there's a gym out in the middle of nowhere like this.
-Pikachu. -Hmm.
As our heroes travel toward their next adventure
at the Fuchsia Gym, they pass through a deep forest
where they find themselves...
I think it's that way!
Completely lost.
Psy...
Well, let's get going.
I got to get to that Fuchsia Gym and win another badge.
Wait a minute. Let's wait for Psyduck.
Psy.
Psyduck, cold water can make a headache even worse.
Psy?
Sometimes I just look at that Psyduck face and I get a headache.
-What beautiful hair. -Huh?
Suzie's such a great breeder.
Hey, Brock. How about a trade? That Vulpix for my Psyduck?
No way.
It wouldn't take much time to brush'cause Psyduck only has three hairs.
Psy.
Come on, guys. We better get going.
Hold on. If we fall, our Pokemon journey's over.
-Pikachu. -Ah!
Are you sure Fuchsia Gym is somewhere around here?
-Pika! - Huh?
Huh? What's that?
That's weird. A huge mansion right in the middle of nowhere.
I didn't know any old houses like this still existed.
Well, at least we can ask somebody here the way to the Fuchsia Gym.
Hello? Is anybody here?
Is anyone home?
Seems deserted.
Hello.
Hm. Ah!
Huh? Misty?
-Kachu. -What's wrong? Where's Misty?
-Chu! -She's gone.
-Ash, this is a secret door. -Secret door?
When you touch this wall, it opens.
Ow. Brock, what kind of crazy place is this?
It sure isn't your run-of-the-mill mansion.
-Pikachu. - Huh?
- Venonat! -What's that?
Venonat. A bug Pokemon.
It's eyes function as radar, allowing it to see in the dark.
Venonat.
Hey, that's not a run-of-the-mill Pokemon.
Hey, wait up! Where is the owner of this place?
Venonat!
-Say what? -Maybe it wants us to follow it, Ash.
-Chu. -Let's go see.
Yeah!
Ah!
Pikachu. Why did you do that to me?
-Chu-chu. -Well, if you didn't do it, then...
Ash, look there!
Doesn't look friendly. Wonder what it is.
Voltorb. The identity of this creature is unknown.
It has an extreme personality, uses electric attacks,
and at times, self-destructs.
Voltorb. This place gets weirder and weirder.
Where'd Venonat go?
- Look. Over there. -Hey! Wait up.
Whoa!
-Ah. -Ash, what is it? What happened?
-It's an invisible wall. -An invisible wall?
Brock, this place is really giving me the creeps.
Right. We better get out of here while we still have the chance.
Yeah, come on, Ash. Let's go.
-It's another invisible wall. -
I think we've fallen into somebody's trap.
-A trap? -A trap?
I hope they're not trying to trap us so they can steal our Pokemon.
Huh?
'cause I don't want them to take away my Vulpix.
Come on, Brock. We gotta get out of this place.
Maybe there's an exit. Ah!
Ah!
- Ash! -Pika, pi!
-Oh, no, he's gone. -Oh, Ash.
Pikachu.
- Hey, guys! I'm still alive. - Huh?
Here! Down here. Come on. Help me up!
Oh, that was close.
This is a dangerous place if you're not careful.
- - Huh?
Venonat?
It's you. I'm going to teach you a lesson.
Come back! Ah!
Whoa!
- Ash! -Kachu!
Huh? Where is he?
There must be another way out.
Maybe it's just another trick.
-Someone help me. -Huh?
- -Huh?
Born in darkness, living in darkness, such is the fate of the ninja.
I am Aya, ninja warrior.
But don't you think that color is a little bright for a ninja?
I don't need your fashion report.
But tell me, didn't you enjoy my little star treatment?
You can't just chuck throwing stars around.
-It's dangerous. -That's right. Tell her, Brock.
-Huh? -
I think that electric pink suits you perfectly,
and you certainly look lovely.
-Ah! -Whoa.
This is a training camp.
It was your fault you let your guard down.
My guard down?
I won't let you leave this mansion
without first having a Pokemon battle with me first.
-Huh? -Venonat.
Oh, that thing.
This Venonat informed me
that three stupid-looking people had entered the mansion.
Venonat.
For your information we're not the stupid ones around here.
I accept your challenge!
Uh, but first could you let me down from here?
Ah!
One Pokemon for each of us. Choose yours now.
Bulbasaur, I choose you!
Bulbasaur.
-I select Venonat. -Venonat.
-Bulbasaur! Tackle now! -
-Venonat! -Sar!
-Venonat, stun spore. -
Bulbasaur, whirlwind. Now! Vine whip!
Venonat! Venonat!
Psybeam now.
-Bulbasaur! -
Hang in there, Bulbasaur!
Now it's time to give it your leech seed!
-Bulbasaur! -Venonat!
Venonat?
Leech seed is sucking away your Venonat's power.
-It's helpless. -Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur.
Return, Venonat.
Good work, Bulbasaur. A victory for me.
- -Voltorb.
It's that Voltorb!
You've still got a lot to learn, Aya.
Honored brother, I have failed.
And you're Aya's older brother? My name is Brock.
You sure have a very nice sister. It's a pleasure to meet... Ah!
This is no time to kiss up, Brock.
None of you will be permitted to leave this venerable mansion
unless you do battle with me.
Who are you?
I am Koga, the Pokemon master of the Fuchsia Gym.
-Oh, so this is the Fuchsia Gym? -That is correct, miss.
-Well, at least we're in the right place. -
So that's the famous ninja mansion.
Well, I for one am not impressed. It looks like a Japanese restaurant.
There are lots of precious poisonous Pokemon in that mansion.
Then let's figure a way to bust into this ninja joint,
snatch the poison Pokemon and hit the road.
Poisonous Pokemon are positively perfect for perfidious people like us.
-What does that mean? -It means beautiful things can be painful.
Ow. That hurt.
-Let's go. -Ooh!
Well, that's fine with me.
We were looking for Fuchsia Gym, and now I'll win one of your badges.
This soul badge will be yours if you defeat me, of course.
All right, let's battle.
We shall have two-on-two Pokemon battle, young man.
That's fine with me. I'll start with Pidgeotto!
Then I shall lead with Venonat.
Guess I'll just have to beat this Venonat, too.
This Venonat has a great deal more experience.
- -Venomoth! Venomoth! Venomoth!
-A metamorphosis attack? -No, it just evolved.
Venomoth. An evolved form of Venonat.
Tiny scales on its wings disperse various spores
- when they are flapped. -Uh-oh.
-Venomoth, stun spore. -Venomoth!
-Pidgeotto, whirlwind! -
-Pidgeotto! -Venomoth, release your sleep powder.
Oh. Pidgeotto, return.
Charmander, go!
Venomoth, stun spore.
-Charmander! Flamethrower! -Char!
Great job, Charmander.
Huh? What's that?
What's going on here?
Now let our ancient performance begin.
Prepare for trouble.
Make it double.
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie. -James.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare. Prepare to fight.
Meowth. That's right.
Now step aside while we pick up all your pretty little poisonous Pokemon.
-Forget it, Meowth. -
Jessie, it's too hard to move in these costumes.
A ninja mansion calls for a kabuki star.
-We have to wear these outfits. -Yes, but-
If you can't move, we'll lose the Pokemon.
You're right. Let's change.
We'll have to join forces
-to vanquish them. -Right.
-Charmander, go! -Char!
-Go, Venomoth. -Go, Venonat.
Step right up. Ha!
-Huh? -Oh.
-Ah, Pikachu. -Pika!
-You're in the way. -
-Pika. -Pikachu!
-Pika, pi!- We need you now, Starmie!
Psyduck.
-Psyduck! You're not Starmie! -Psy?
This time I'll choose Staryu.
Psy?
You're Psyduck, not Staryu. Don't you understand?
Fine, then. Go if you want to.
-Psyduck. Psy. -
-Psy! -Psyduck, you're driving me crazy!
Psy-i-i-i.
-Psyduck. Psyduck. -What attacks can Psyduck do?
Here, ask Dexter.
Psyduck's attacks are, one, tail whip.
Psyduck. Tail whip attack now!
-Psyduck. Psyduck. Psy... -
How can you call that lame tail wag an attack?
It must have other attacks.
Psyduck attacks. Number two: scratch.
-All right, Psyduck. Scratch attack now! -Psyduck.
Psy.
Psy.
Psy!
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!
What a totally pathetic Pokemon.
-Now it's giving me a headache. -I think I have a way out of this.
- Huh? -What are they?
I don't know what they are, but they're in the way.
This is a nice little catch.
I don't know what these things are,
but I can use them to practice my bowling game.
That's a Voltorb!
A Voltorb?
-Voltorb. -Ah!
-Ah! -Hey, Brock.
Do you notice anything weird about this room?
The walls, the beams, the ceiling, they're all on a slant.
This is a slanted room to confuse our enemies.
-No good. I can't get it off. -Char.
How about your electric attack, Pikachu?
-Kachu! -Char.
Pikachu.
This gunk isn't affected by electricity.
- -Huh?
There you are.
For some reason I seem to be losing my liqui-ebrium.
Whoa!
They built this place like a fun house. The floor is slanted.
Maybe they'll have some fun with this Voltorb.
Voltorb.
Pikachu! Electric attack now.
Pika, pika.
Oh, I forgot.
What's with this loser Pokemon?
Psyduck, you're just going to get hurt out there. Return!
Psy-i-i-i!
You're in the way!
-Let's snatch this Pokemon, too. -We don't need Pokemon like that.
Even rejected by Team Rocket.
It looks like its headache's getting worse.
-Uh, look. You come here right now. -Huh?
-Ah! What's...? What's happening? -I... I'm frozen. I can't move!
Hey, this must be one Psyduck's attacks.
Psyduck's attacks. Number three: disable.
Psyduck's attacks. Number four: confusion.
-Psyduck's attacks are pretty good. -Yeah.
-You're right. -
This place looks a lot nicer from the air.
And what else it looks like-
Team Rocket's blasting off again!
Psy.
-Pika. -Char!
And you had that kind of power all along?
When Psyduck's headache becomes severe, it uses amazing power.
Psy-i-i-duck.
-That kind of talent's a real pain. -Oh, yeah.
Magnificent. That was quite an impressive display.
I was very impressed by your performance.
Young lady, would you consider trading your Psyduck for my Venomoth?
I'd gladly trade for my Venonat.
Well, I wouldn't trade Psyduck for any Pokemon in the world.
Misty, you couldn't wait to get rid of Psyduck.
A woman's heart can be a very fickle thing, Ash.
A Pokemon like that would certainly merit one of our soul badges.
Uh, that's right. We still haven't finished our match.
The Pokemon I choose for this battle is Charmander.
And I will choose, Golbat!
-Golbat. - What's that?
Golbat. Attacking with its sharp fangs,
this Pokemon can drain 300 cubic centimeters of blood per bite.
-Be careful, Charmander. -Golbat. Wing attack.
Golbat. Golbat. Golbat. Golbat.
Charmander. Ember attack.
Charmander!
Golbat. Golbat.
-All right. Good job, Charmander. -Golbat. Golbat.
Golbat, use your screech attack.
Golbat. Golbat.
-Ooh, I can't stand that noise. -Ah! I'm getting goose bumps.
Charmander, flamethrower.
Char! Char! Char!
Ouch.
Golbat. Golbat. Golbat.
Okay. Finish it off with fire spin.
Golbat. Golbat.
Golbat. Golbat.
Golbat.
-We did it. -Char, char.
You have beaten me.
And Psyduck saved my Voltorb from being stolen by those thieves.
This soul badge rightfully belongs to you.
A soul badge! All right!
We both have got a lot to learn about battle.
-We will now train even harder, Aya. -Yes, brother.
Yes! I got a soul badge! All right! Woo-hoo!
So after earning a soul badge,
our heroes continue along on their Pokemon journey.
You know, you did a really great job back there, Psyduck.
I hope success doesn't go to your head.
Psyduck.
