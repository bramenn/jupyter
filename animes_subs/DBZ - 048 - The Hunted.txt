Elder!
Dodoria- san! Wait!
Begin by killing these three younger ones!
Dammit!
I'll dispose of all three of you within ten seconds.
Don't be ridiculous! You think you're a match for all three of us!?
Huh? Do l think I'm a match for you? What an amusing joke.
What!?
Come on!
What!?
It's hopeless! He can't defeat that guy with that kind of attack!
You now understand that it is useless to try to defy us or run away, I trust.
In any case, come back down here, please.
So you have finally grown cooperative, I see. That will do.
You have destroyed my precious Scouters.
May I have you produce your Dragon Ball, by way of apology?
I have no choice. But promise me that no matter what,
you will not lay a hand on the children!
Yes, yes, we ought to have done it this way right from the beginning.
W- what monsters these guys are! How awful!
Why, those-!
H- hey, Gohan! Don't go getting any funny ideas.
T- there's simply no way we can stand up to those guys, okay?
Yow-ow-ow... With twenty times the gravity, you get twenty times the pain!
Now, take this, and get out of here at once.
Well done.
While I am at it, let me also have you tell me the locations
of the two remaining Dragon Balls.
Don't be ridiculous!
We Namekians don't sell each other out, even if it means our own lives!
Now, we had an agreement! Leave here at once!
Oh dear, not you, too.
There is absolutely no one on this planet who will speak about their friends.
I guess I will have to have you die... along with the children!
W- what did you say!? Why, you-!
Elder! Elder!
This isn't what we agreed to!
You promised you wouldn't do anything else if I handed over the Dragon Ball!
But unless I have all seven Dragon Balls, it is meaningless, correct?
You have destroyed our Scouters, so we will need to have you tell us
where the remaining two are.
I told you, I'll tell you about the others over my dead body!
Is that how badly you want to die? In that case, I will do as you wish.
What!?
Freeza- sama, will we possibly be able to search for the Dragon Balls without Scouters?
Kill all three of them.
Yes, sir.
T- that's dirty!
You guys run! Run away!
Right!
I'll show you the pride of the Namekian people!
C- Cargot!
Control yourself, Gohan!
Control yourself. There's nothing we can do! Hey!
Cargot! Cargot! Cargot!
You didn't even have a chance to show us this pride of yours, huh?
It won't even be any fun to smash a little kid like this.
Well, all the same, die!
Stop!!
Gohan!
What? Your buddies? Where?
Does that teach you?
W- who the hell are you!?
That idiot!
I am going to take you down!!
What did you say?
Kuririn- san!
You dumbass! Run! Hurry!
Hurry!
Right!
They do not appear to be Namekians, do they?
No, sir.
Damn it!
After them! Dodoria- san, catch them!
Gohan, fly as fast as you can! If he catches us, we're finished!
Right!
Fools! Do you think you can escape?
It's no good! He's faster than us! He'll overtake us!
They are quite fast, aren't they, Freeza- sama?
They also seem to have more battle power than the Namekians.
Who in the world could they be?
In the way, to be sure. That mountain is in the way, you see?
Now our visibility has become much clearer, has it not?
Huh?
Gohan!
Oh, crap!
Damn!
Dammit, let go of me! Let go of me, you!
I'm not going to make it in time!
Gohan! Get out of here! Hurry! He's coming!
Damn, these sure are nimble little guys!
Kuririn- san, let's land and fight him!
We can't! He isn't the sort of foe we can do anything against by fighting!
Just fly as hard as you can!
Damn, if this keeps up, we've had it! I've got to do something!
That's it! Gohan!
Gohan, from here on, don't look in my direction! Close your eyes!
I have an idea. Got that!?
Right!
Take this!
Taiyo-ken!!
My eyes! My eyes!
My eyes!
I did it! It worked!
Why, you-! My eyes!
Gohan! Hide now, while we can!
Right!
W- why, you rotten-!
W- where did you go, dammit!?
Where are you!? Where the hell did you go!?
Come on out, dammit!
W- what did you do, Kuririn- san?
Oh, I just blinded him a little bit.
It's okay. He doesn't have his Scouter anymore, after all.
However, will they indeed be able to escape the hands of this brutal pursuer?
