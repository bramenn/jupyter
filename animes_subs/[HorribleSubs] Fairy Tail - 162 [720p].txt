Is Natsu okay?
There's nothing to worry about with him.
He just has motion sickness.
What about Wendy?
She's recovered a lot.
Are you back to normal, Carla?
Yes...
Well, thank goodness for that!
Everyone's waiting, so I'll be going.
You don't intend to say anything?
What good would telling her about that future do?
There's no way she would believe me.
Mercurius collapsing...
It was Lucy...
The Grand Magic Games are held once a year.
Natsu and company participated in the elimination round,
and just barely placed eighth, qualifying them for the actual Games.
The Grand Magic Games began.
Between the competition part on the first day, Hidden, and the battle part,
Natsu and his compatriots were shut out, gaining zero points.
Zero points? That makes it fun, don't ya think?
We're gonna turn it around from this point on.
Yeah! I'm fired up!
In the competition of the second day, Chariot,
Natsu, representing Fairy Tail, finally got two points.
Then the battle part began.
Super Paralysis Claw Mega Mega Jellyfish!
He disappeared!
Sand Rebellion!
You're strong.
You're tough, too.
Blacksnake's a cool name!
It's not my real name...
It's not your real name?!
That ticks you off?
You! If I win, you're tellin' me your real name!
That's fine, but what if I win?
I'll tell you a secret about myself!
That sounds interesting.
Apparently, they've made a weird bet.
I'm not interested in learning either one, though...
Cool!
A bet?
I like the sound of that...
Why, you! C'mere! Fangface!
Toby's down! And he's not getting back up!
The match is over!
The winner is Blacksnake of Raven Tail!
He's strong...
Yeah. And I don't think he was really trying hard.
Even without the dirty tricks, they've got strong people on their team.
This brings Raven Tail up to 36 points.
And Lamia Scale has...
Cool!
So, what's your secret?
My socks...
I can't find one of them...
Even though I've been searching for it for the past three months,
I can't find it for some reason...
I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone...
It was right here all this time?!
You're a nice guy.
I found it at last!
Yajima-san, what do you think...?
No comment.
Cool! Cool!
Good for you, dog-like guy!
Unbelievably, I'm a little touched by this!
Um...
Spin!
Oh, my!
The two congratulate each other on a good fight and shake hands...
Or rather, they don't!
That was cruel! Too cruel!
It's my nature to want to destroy something precious.
You won't get away with this!
I'll spin you!
Me again?!
What's his deal?!
There's a man with a sick sense of humor!
That's the true nature of Raven Tail.
Nasty...
I don't even know what Ivan's thinkin'...
I bet he was just being malicious, plain and simple!
Okay, let's get back on track with today's second match!
From Quatro Cerberus, Bacchus!
Versus an opponent from Fairy Tail A...
Us?
What do we do if they announce Natsu?!
I'll slap him awake.
That Bacchus guy... He's on the same level as you, right, Erza?
There he is!
I don't care who does it, but somebody avenge me!
Calm down, Cana...
If it's Gray-sama, he'll win with ease.
You did set it up as I asked?
Yes, Your Highness.
I can't wait! Bacchus versus Erza!
This is definitely going to be one great match!
D-Did you just say Erza?
I-I paired him up against...
Elfman!
What?!
Elfman?!
Elf-nii-chan?!
It's over!
That's a terrible thing to say!
Make us proud!
The only thing we can do now is win!
Y-Yeah...
Elfman vs. Bacchus!
I wanted to see Bacchus versus Erza!
I apologize.
Fairy Tale's, um... The one that transforms...
I can't remember the name. It starts with E...
I made a mistake...
This won't be any kind of fight!
Clearly, Bacchus will annihilate him!
P-Probably...
Good luck, Fairy Tail!
But if his opponent is Bacchus...
Hey, how about you and me make a bet like those last guys did?
Both of your sisters are delightful dishes...
What do you wanna say?
It's an old story.
If I win, they're mine.
Both of them, at the same time...
Bastard...
Two at the same time... That's a warped form of love!
You're disgusting!
If you win... Let's see...
Man...
There are some things a Man can't let pass...
Hound dog...
I'm gonna tear you apart!
Then we have a deal?
My soul is quivering.
That was a great sleep!
Wendy...
Carla...
Granny?
Where'd everyone go?
A stranger's scent lingering in the room...
This way!
There!
Fairy Tail?!
You found us already?!
No, this is the one that was sleeping!
Scum!
Where the hell are you takin' Wendy and the others?!
Oh, no!
Hurry!
Hold it!
He's hella fast!
Ain't that the one who staggered to the finish line in the last competition?!
Leave him to me!
This is the best way to deal with wizards!
Move!
Jackasses!
Give me back Wendy and the others!
What is he?!
That crazy bastard is scary! And he'll catch up to us at this rate!
What do we do?!
No other choice! We dump these two!
D-Don't be an idiot!
The order was to get the girl in the infirmary!
An old bag and some cat aren't girls!
Then why'd we bring them?!
Wait, when you look at this old woman from a certain angle...
She's no girl!
Who gave you the order?!
We're done for!
Oh my! This is unquestionably a one-sided match!
Elfman can't land a blow!
Beautiful sisters all to myself... Nice...
H-Hey, is that...?
I can see how he'd fight you to a draw, Erza.
No, what's really hard to deal with is coming up.
Elf-nii-chan...
Don't worry! He's a man who gets down to business when he needs to, right?
Yeah. That's true...
Go, Elfman!
Beast Soul: Weretiger!
A lightning-quick Take Over!
If his attacks hit now...
Wild...
Even at that speed,
Elfman's attacks aren't landing at all!
Maybe it's because of that guy's weird movements...
His magic
is actually pretty orthodox. It's a type where magic converges in the palms of his hands.
But the secret of his strength
is mastery of a martial art that allows him to maximize that magic.
The style of martial art is called Cleaving Hook Palm
and that characteristic stance is used to deliver skillful palm strikes.
Palm strikes...
What was even more fearsome
is when he improved on that martial art,
devising Drunken Cleaving Hook Palm.
Drunken...
You mean he's drunk?
That's right.
It's impossible to predict the attacks of a drunken hawk.
On top of that, his destructive force has been beefed up, making him a shoo-in to win.
Even so, that's not the problem.
He hasn't had even one drop of booze yet.
Cleaving Hook Palm...
That's an unusual style of martial art.
Actually, I've never seen it myself.
Cool!
Hey, is that...
The move we saw at the tavern incident.
Dammit. Isn't there anything he can do?
He'll figure out a way.
He's more than just a big lug.
That's right.
We've got to believe in him!
Wild...
Stand up, Elfman!
The movements of drunken Bacchus are as powerful as they are unpredictable.
Huh?
But he hasn't had anything to drink yet, right?
Then...
He isn't trying hard at all.
Oh, my! Elfman's Take Over has come undone!
Not only has he consumed a lot of magic power,
but it also goes to show how powerful that attack was.
Cleaving Hook Palm is cool!
You're a man, aren't you?
You will keep your promise, right?
Can't Elfman rise again?!
I forgot one important thing.
Today, the Grand Magic Games official mascot-slash-judge,
Mato-kun, has the day off,
so I'm filling in as the judge, too.
Two roles! Cool! Two roles, cool!
The day off?!
Why? All he needs to take a break is change his innards.
You shouldn't say innards!
So you are standing up? I guess all that repetition of the word man wasn't for nothing.
Come to think of it, I didn't decide yet, hound dog.
The bet... What happens if I win...
Well, there's no chance of that,
so go ahead, whatever you want.
If I win, the name of your guild
is Quatro Puppy for the duration of the Games.
Puppy? As in little dog?
Four Puppies?
I like that! Make'em say it, Elfman!
Okay, okay. That does it.
Bottom's up...
I think I'll wind this up.
He drank booze!
It's coming... Elfman!
Now he's serious!
Uh-oh! Bacchus has hit the bottle at last!
Drunken Cleaving Hook Palm...
This is the first time I've seen it before my very eyes! Cool!
Come and get me.
You should easily be able to beat a drunk like me.
Beast Soul...
It's no use!
Elfman!
That's Drunken Cleaving Hook Palm!
I-I don't know what happened because I couldn't see it!
Seven blows in that one instant!
I-Incredible...
That just did a lot of damage, didn't it?
Yes. But...
How was that?
What the hell is this?!
My hands...
Uh-oh! What's this?! Damage to Bacchus!
What is that?
Lizardman...
If I can't hit you, then you can hit me!
I didn't know about that...
Don't tell me this is his...
I think the other guy's in big trouble.
What does he mean to do?
Don't take your eyes off of them.
Watch his battle to the end.
Come on!
Your hands or my body...
This is a fight to see which will break!
Wild...
That's some strategy.
It's crazy.
True, Lizardman's skin and scales are covered with innumerable spines,
so it goes well against a bare-handed opponent,
but this particular opponent can shatter Lizardman's tough scales.
What's wrong?!
You're an interesting guy!
My soul is quivering!
Man!
I-It's a frenzy!
More of a clash of wills than a battle!
Will the attacker give out?!
Or the receiver buckle?!
Just who...
Your name... is Elfman?
Wild...
No...
Bacchus is the one who got back up!
You know... you're...
Bacchus is down!
The winner is Elfman!
Fairy Tail A gets 10 points!
This gives them a total of 12 points!
Does this battle roar portend Fairy Tail's comeback?!
Elfman pulls off a spectacular victory over a formidable enemy!
Listen to that cheering!
Elfman-san did it!
Wendy, are you okay now?
Yeah! I feel fine.
Thank you, Grandine!
I told you not to call me that!
Anyway, those scoundrels from before...
We just took the job!
F-From somebody in Raven Tail!
We were told to get the girl who was in the infirmary.
Good work.
We'll take care of them.
Raven Tail...
The girl... who was in the infirmary...
Past tense?
There was one there.
Natsu carried her in.
You don't mean...
Lucy!
The plan failed.
Fool!
In the first place, you had the wrong target.
Didn't I tell you what she looked like?
I'm sorry.
Oh, forget about it.
It just means we'll move to plan B.
Where are the actual perpetrators?
We arrested them and hauled them off to prison.
Their cover isn't blown?
No, sir. They believe their client is Raven Tail.
We need to keep using the discord between Fairy Tail and Raven Tail like this.
And while they're busy feuding, we'll grab a Celestial Spirit Wizard...
Why the long face?
Raven Tail...
All they've been doing is playing dirty tricks...
Natsu-san...
Certainly, Raven's master is...
So what does that mean?
I don't really know,
but this ain't over by a long shot!
Natsu! I hear next time is a pin-up model showdown between Mira and Jenny!
And you can barge in on it?!
Everyone's wearing a swimsuit!
A-Although I'm not the least bit interested in girls' swimsuits!
Huh, is that right?! Oh, Charlotte's wearing a swimsuit, too!
She goes along with stuff more than I thought...
Carla! Where is she?!
Next time: Mirajane versus Jenny!
Carla is so cute! Carla, good luck!
Happy... Mira's the one who's fighting.
