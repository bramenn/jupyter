Reach out and it will begin!
Notte Auf!
Auden Fretore!
I've finally made it to the holy land the world's greatest witch, Shiny Chariot, grew up in!
There aren't any buses in this town.
It says there's supposed to be a terminal here.
But seriously, this map's way too ambiguous.
Look, I've got a rare card of Chariot! It's my treasure.
Chariot's gotta be loved over in the magic world.
Nobody else seems to care where I'm from.
They ask me if I'm still living in the last century.
I tried ordering a magic learning kit online, but it all went over my head.
It was awful with all the tourists everywhere.
Oh, I heard a rumor about the new freshmen.
Geez, they've been letting too many plebeians in recently!
I heard the academy's having financial issues, and can't keep operating without accepting non-witches.
Who are you?
'Tia Fraere!
Tia Frere!
Leyline Terminal.
The leyline connects this location to Luna Nova.
Magic energy has flowed through this leyline since ancient times.

And even if I did, I can't ride it.
'Tia Fraere!
Tia Frere!
It's the forest of ancient legend. This is sacred land protected by a magic circle.
Kutchur Katela Flala.
A collector of deadly poisons like me can't ignore such a super rare item.
It's a super rare item a deadly poison collector like me can't ignore.
Nope, you're a sacrifice.
It's over, we won't be there in time...
It's over, there's no way we'll make it.
If you reach out...
Birdbrain, over here! Come and catch me if you can!
Notte Auf!
Notte... Auf!
Auden!
Auden!
Fretore!
As you have crossed its threshold once more,
you are expected to act with pride and decorum while maintaining a sense of modesty.
I will now begin the matriculation cere
My word, that was a unprecedented ceremony.
Chariot!
Reach out, and it will begin!
Your very own story!
Noctu Orfei!
Aude Fraetor!

Never forget.
A believing heart is your magic.

I've finally made it! This is the holy land the world's greatest witch, Shiny Chariot, grew up in!
Wahoo!
Barf.
This is where I'll become a witch!
Hello!
Hi there!
Could you tell me where the bus stop for Luna Nova is?
It's the school Shiny Chariot went to!
Do you know where I can catch the bus to Luna Nova?
Hey there, got a sec? I'm looking for a bus stop around here.
We don't have any buses in this town.
That's weird...
It does say there's a terminal here...
But seriously, this map's way too vague.
How am I supposed to find my way with it?
Found it, found it!
Ow, ow, ow...
S-Sorry about that...
Is this yours?
Are you entering Luna Nova too?
Heading to the matriculation ceremony now?
Score!
I was feeling kind of lonely about heading to the witch academy all alone.
I'm Akko! Ever since I saw Shiny Chariot's magic show when I was six, it's been my dream to become a witch!
Or more like, that's when my fate was decided?
You must know who Shiny Chariot is!
Look, a rare card of Chariot. It's my treasure!
I'm sure they love Chariot in the magic world.
Where I'm from, nobody else really seems to care...
They always ask me if I'm stuck in the last decade.
But Chariot's the only witch that amazing, don't you think?
And then there was that moon...
Whoa, puppet magic!
I've never seen it done in real life.
Good girl, come over here. I won't hurt you.
Come on
My eye! My eye...
Hey, that was mean!
W-Wait up!
What's your name? How'd you make that magic?
I ordered a magic learning kit online, but I had no idea what to do with it.
I don't even really understand the basics all that well...
But I'm hoping to learn the kind of magic Chariot uses in school.
U-Um...
O-Oh, uh...
Let's get along!
Get off! Get off! Get
For crying out loud, what's with that girl?
Luna Nova uniforms!
How was your spring break?
Awful, with all the tourists swarming the place.
Speaking of awful, I heard a rumor about the new students.
It seems one of them isn't of witch blood.
Seriously?!
Geez, they've been letting too many commoners in recently!
I heard the academy's having financial issues and can't keep operating without accepting non-witches.
This is the worst.
There goes Luna Nova's reputation.
What if she can't ride a broom?
How absurd!
There hasn't been a witch in Luna Nova's entire history who couldn't ride a broom.
And you are?
K-Kagari Atsuko.
I'm a new student.
Oh, so it's you.
E-Excuse me...
I sure hope the bus gets here soon.
Bus?
Huh? Isn't this the bus stop?
You've got no idea!
Do you truly believe a bus would come here?
Tia Fraere!
This is a broom stop.
The Leyline Terminal.
This location is connected to Luna Nova through a leyline.
Magic energy has flowed through the leylines since ancient times.
You can fly to Luna Nova by riding that energy.
This is a magic highway!
It's common sense to witches!
Let's hurry.
We'll be permanently expelled from the magic world if we're late to matriculation.
What now?
Come on...
Aw man, I'm so late!
Darnit!
Mom and Yanne gave me way too many gifts to bring back.
Thanks.
Tia Frae
A-Aren't you coming? The matriculation ceremony starts soon.
Since I don't recognize you, does that mean you're new?
Luna Nova is really strict about its rules.
Not only will they shut the doors on you if you're late, you'll be expelled too.
I don't have a broom.
And even if I did, I couldn't ride it.
S-Sorry, I don't want to be late.
Want a ride?
I've never flown double before, but I might be able to pull it off.
Really? Thank you!
So there are nice witches too!
I'm Kagari Atsuko! Call me Akko!
I-I'm Lotte.
Be quick, we're running out of time.
Okay!
Let's take off.
Fly, my broom.
Tia Fraere!
No way, no way!
We're flying! We're flying! We're flying! We're fly
I think your luggage is too heavy.
Open, gateway to Luna Nova!
What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this?!
I can't do this! Get me off this thing!
Settle down a bit!
My stuff!
Normal witches are unable to enter the legendary forest of Arcturus.
This has never happened before. Something's off!
Please don't tell me you're carrying salt.
Salt?
Leylines hate salt!
Maybe it's this?
What's that?
Pickled plums.
Toss it!
But I can't survive without pickled plum
Please, throw it away!
F-Fine!
My treasure!
Stop, it's dangerous!
Ouch!
Little Witch Academia
Little Witch Academia
What's the matter, Alcor?
It couldn't beArcturus Forest?!
Thank goodness! My treasure is safe!
Sh-She's dead!
You are the very definition of trouble.
Y-You're alive!
Something like that won't kill a witch.
Lotte!
Are you all right? Did you get hurt?
I'm fine, but my broom isn't.
It appears we reached my destination.
Destination?
Then this is Luna Nova?
Where's the ceremony?
This isn't the place. I've never seen this forest before.
It's Arcturus Forest.
Arcturus?
No way! The forbidden forest?!
What's that?
It's a forest of ancient legend. This is sacred land, protected by a magic circle.
They say that even witches can't escape once they've wandered in.
What, that's no good! How am I supposed to make matriculation now?
You should worry more about being stuck here your entire life.
Hey, don't scare me like that!
Found some of my stuff!
Gotcha.
Akko, get back!
Hurry!
What the heck is that thing?!
It's a mandrake, a poisonous plant.
This way!
There.
Ouch...
Hey.
Come here for a sec.
What is it?
Stand in here.
Juras Haras Haras.
What is this?
Cast the spell.
Spell?
Will that help us get out?
Kutchur Katela Flala.
Kutchur Kat... F-Fla-fla?
Kutchur Katela Flala.
Shout it from your belly!
Kutchur Katela Flala!
Wh-What's going on?
Heya.
What's this thing? What did that spell just do?
You said Hey stupid, come eat me if you want to shut me up.
What?!
That's a mythical cockatrice which lives only in Arcturus Forest.
They say its feathers contain a deadly poison.
A collector of deadly poisons can't ignore such a super rare item.
Distract it for me.
I'll grab a feather in the meantime.
What?! Are you saying you used us as bait?!
Nope, you're a sacrifice.
Shout that line one more time!
Heck no!
Good job, keep on dodging.
You'll be petrified if you get caught in its breath.
Petrified?
No way!
You're mine.
W-W-We can't stop!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
We have to get out of here.
There's no way we'll make it if we keep on wasting time!
Ow!
My leg...
It's over, we can't get there in time...
Don't say that!
I'll never give up!
I have to go...
I'm going to be a witch!
If I reach out...
It's sure to begin!
Thrilling...
And exciting...
My very own story!
That's... Chariot's magic staff!
Lotte, wait here and hide.
Huh?
Kutchur Katela Flala!
Hey!
Birdbrain, here I am! Try to catch me if you can!
Looks like it worked.
Hey.
Hop on.
Thanks, um...
It's Sucy. Sucy Manbavaran.
Thanks, Sucy.
He doesn't know when to give up!
We can't all get away on one broom!
This is terrible!
Now he's breathing fire!
What are they doing in such a place?
Oh no, we're burning!
That's...
The Shiny Rod!
Hot hot hot hot hot!
The magic words!
Cast the spell!
The staff!
Noctu Orfei!
Noctu... Orfei!
Aude!
Aude!
Fraetor!
Shiny Arc!
