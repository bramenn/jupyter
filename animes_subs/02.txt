Meow...
Ah, this feels great!
The water gets deeper that way, so be careful.
You okay?
Yeah.
What do you think you're looking at? There's a damsel in distress here!
Sorry! Sorry!
Togashi, you perv!
Aw, stop it!
Togashi, you perv!
Stop it!
You perv!
Stop it, please!
Stop it!
You've finally come back to us.
What's that you're holding?
The Heidrich Buster!
Pressure rising in the mana chamber.
Energy charging, 120...
So that was you?!
What happened to your forehead?
My forehead?
I was caught up in a fierce battle last night, and
Ah, it'd be safer for you not to know.
Eighth-grader syndrome is a real pain to deal with.
A cat?
Meow!
A chimera?
You mean the monster from Greek mythology and video games?
Yeah. Last night I was investigating the Ethereal Horizon, when suddenly...
I caught it!
You want to keep it?
Yes.
This beast will serve as my familiar.
A chimera from the depths of oblivion should prove invaluable in my search for the Ethereal Horizon.
But there's one problem.
What problem?
The priestess of the Ethereal Horizon Overseers displays immune hyperreaction to chimeras.
You mean your sister is allergic to cats?
And thus I enlist the help of my comrade, the Dark Flame Mas
Not a chance.
A week has passed since I started high school.
All right, thanks in advance.
Hey, Dark Flame Master...
Dark Flame Master!
Shut up!
Over time, I got used to dealing with this serious case of eighth-grader syndrome.
Yuuta...
No means no!
Kuzuha and Yumeha both love animals,
and Mom wouldn't object either,
but doing what you want is against my principles.
Yuuta, you're so mean.
By the way, where's your dad?
He's working in Jakarta.
I see...
Did you know that Jakarta is the origin of the Japanese word for potato?
I must be careful not to let anything slip about my past,
but at least for now I've managed to blend into my class without any problems.
Well then, Hirakata, you're class librarian.
In the end I was so over-conscious about my behavior that I ended up as one of the class reps,
but that might not be such a bad thing at all.
All right, we're finished.
Thanks! Well done.
Homeroom's over.
Nice job, man.
It's tough work being a class rep.
Like you can say that.
Yeah, yeah. Oh, who're you gonna vote for?
I'd like to open the poll soon.
What poll?
The cutie poll!
I told you about it, didn't I? We guys are gonna vote to decide who's the cutest in the class!
Who're you going with?
Are you sure that'll be all right?
The girls won't be impressed if they find out.
Don't worry, they won't!
For things like these, nothing's stronger than the bonds we share as men!
Togashi!
Yeah?
Could you come to the science lab during lunch break?
Remember? The science teacher asked us for help.
We gotta check the equipment.
Seven, eight, nine, ten... There's twelve of these.
Okay, twelve it is.
All right, that's it for this shelf.
This aroma... is it Asience? Petal Sassoon?
Have you gotten used to being a class rep?
It's all pretty new to me still.
If you notice anything, please let me know.
I tend to forget stuff, you see.
Really? You didn't strike me as absent-minded.
I pay special attention to making sure I don't come across that way.
I'm a class rep, after all.
R-Really?
You always seem so calm and collected.
You've been class rep a bunch of times before, right?
Yeah, kinda.
But you got recommended. You must have experience too.
Me? Not at all.
I might've done it once back in elementary school,
but mostly I preferred not to stand out.
Really?
When we first met, I was thinking how alike we were.
Remember? It was at the station, on the day of the entrance ceremony.
You remember that?
Of course! Why wouldn't I?
But you didn't even know my class or name then.
Yeah, but when I got to class and saw you,
I thought Oh, it's him!
R-Really?
Calm down! It's too early to get nervous!
But at least her opinion of me isn't bad, right?
Could it be that if I go down this path,
I might actually get a life?
Let's do the rest tomorrow.
Should I make a move?
Why don't we walk home together?
Wait, let's simulate it first.
Predict her reaction!
Why don't we walk home together?
What's the occasion?
Not a chance!
Wh-What's wrong, Togashi?
Nothing, I just
Togashi?!
What the hell?!
You scared me!
It was you? Again?!
Yuuta, my head's spinning...
Takanashi?
Why are you two here?
We're doing some work for the teacher.
Just ignore her, okay?
So many drugs for such a simple school.
The arm of the Overseers is long indeed.
Could you just quit this charade and take off the coat?
It's not even yours, is it?
Take it off?
Yeah, take it off! Right now!
How bold... Telling me to undress...
You did that intentionally, didn't you?!
And don't play with the chemicals!
Sadly, the chimera lacks the mana to manifest itself in the real world.
I must supplement it by artificial means.
Chimera?
Ah, it's nothing.
Just a gray cat with a mark on its forehead.
Takanashi picked it up yesterday.
Don't call me Takanashi. It's Rikka.
A gray cat?
That reminds me...
Is it really Dodomen?
I'm not sure,
but it pretty much fits this description.
It's about this big.
Its behind is like this.
It has wings
Nowhere.
Yeah, my cat's about that big too.
You mean its wings?
Just shut up.
When did she get lost?
About a week ago.
Do you want to come and see it?
Can I?
Sure, uh...
May Seventh?
Oh, it's pronounced Tsuyuri.
I'm Tsuyuri Kumin. Nice to meet you.
Oh, um... I'm Togashi Yuuta.
Stop that!
I live on the second floor, and Takanashi lives right above me.
Call me Rikka.
Shut up.
You get along so well.
You guys must go way back.
Nah, she just moved in recent
Magic code unlocked.
Just open it already.
It opened... It opened!
You really are a pain.
Wait a moment.
I must check my room for anomalies in the fabric of spacetime.
My bad for trying to barge in.
She's a girl too.
Come in.
Excuse me!
This is amazing!
to the twirling world of chaotic chaos.
You realize you said it twice?
Ah, you like cute plushies, don't you?
That's the Black Tortoise of the North.
That's a military Mauser!
That's cooler than I thought you ever could be!
It's a sacred gun that can exorcise devils.
Yeah, I can totally see that!
Can I see?
Go on.
The Mauser really is awesome!
Actually, you know, the original model of this gun was made a century ago,
and it's pretty awesome, called the M712, and...
You love stuff like that, don't you?
By the way, all objects in this room are placed according to the laws of astrology.
Moving anything is strictly forbidden.
Therefore, cleaning is unnecessary.
Emit.
And where's the cat?
You can't see? Well, I can't expect normal people to.
She's our senior. Show some respect.
Don't worry about it.
She blended in so well!
You can see it?
Could you give it a rest?
So, is this the right one?
I'm afraid not.
Its chin looks different.
I see.
Whose cat is that?
Whose is it?
Whose cat is that?
Airtight blast doors, lock!
Activate radiation barriers!
All personnel, evacuate!
What?!
My room?
What are you doing? This isn't even your room!
We'll be done in a moment.
Are they going to fight?
Don't get so excited.
This time, I will overcome this barrier!
Schwarzschild, full power!
Avalon Sm
You're Togashi Yuuta, right?
I'm Takanashi Tooka, the sister of this freak.
We should talk.
She's still going on about her Wicked Eye or whatever it's called,
just like when she was back in junior high.
It's quite a nuisance.
Not to mention that she knows I'm allergic to cats,
and yet she takes one in just like that.
She doesn't care how much trouble it causes.
I'm sorry, but could you take care of it?
That cat. I can't get rid of it myself.
Please do something about it.
I don't care if you give it to someone or leave it on the street,
just get rid of it.
That's all.
But... why me?
You don't want to?
It's not really about whether I want to.
Then thanks in advance.
But...
I have a record of what was said on this apartment's balcony two years ago.
This is no charade! No fantasy!
This world shall be conquered by darkness as of the year 2012!
Togashi, what's wrong?
What's wrong, Yuuta?
I'm not Yuuta.
I am the Dark Flame Master!
I wield the power of the flames of darkness!
Hey, that's your voice, Togashi!
Stop it, please!
Stop! Please, stop!
I can feel the winds of change!
What are you talking about? There's no wind at all.
I don't want to hear that again! Please!
I can feel... I can feel the power overwhelming!
Don't shout things like that! People will laugh at you!
What care have I for the foolishness of mortals?
I like uploading stuff to comedy websites.
Listen, my beloved sister.
What's wrong with you?
Don't let me down.
I'm sorry, but...
Okay.
She got away.
Dad, Mom, I'm sorry I didn't respect you!
Togashi, let's run away together! Let's run to the ends of the Earth!
I'll hold you to those words.
The ends of the Earth are all around us!
Our world is round, after all!
Why did you do that?
Your sister was really mad!
We must escape, and quickly.
She's a high-level priestess of the Overseers.
We must not take her powers lightly.
Your blood shall be a sacrifice to these chains!
Bloody Prison!
Nice try.
She can even teleport. It's truly frightening.
Weren't you just being careless?
She's here!
This is so much fun! Like a horror movie!
It isn't fun at all!
I saw something sparkle in the distance!
Tsuyuri!
Yuuta, hurry!
How should I put this... I feel like my life is in danger.
Sadly, I have no means to defeat the priestess in this time space.
But I will eventually have to confront her.
It's dangerous to go by yourselves. Take this.
Let's live together once this battle is over.
Stop tripping death flags!
Yuuta, you must run!
I'll buy us some time.
You go on ahead!
I must find the Ethereal Horizon.
No matter what.
Takanashi...
I told you to call me Rikka.
The chimera!
So that's where they are.
I'll stop her!
Catch the chimera, Yuuta!
Come forth, Schwarz Sechs Prototype Mark II!
Blast reality!
Burst it into shreds!
Banishment... this world!
Heed the call of blood.
I summon thee!
Dark Matter Blaze!
Takanashi...
She's... actually holding her ground?
Nergal Blast!
Come on, Takanashi!
Wicked Twinkle!
Enough is enough!
That's quite enough of your delusions.
Anyway, keep that cat away from me.
That's all I want for now.
Ouch.
Use these.
I don't get it.
That should have ended with my Wicked Twinkle.
How did I lose?
It only works that way in your imagination.
It still stings.
Dark Matter Blaze.
It was like a fighting game.
A model gun should do it.
Sorry, but I can't let you return to your former home.
I don't want to get hurt anymore.
Mom, can I keep a cat?
Wow, what's this all of a sudden?
Look, a kitty! It's so cute!
Kumin's cat was found unhurt soon after.
