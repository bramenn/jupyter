Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
With Natsu and the others joining in the Battle of Fairy Tail,
and the Raijin Tribe completely defeated,
all that's left is to stop Laxus's Thunder Palace.
But just then, the master collapsed!
Yo Ho! Steer that rudder! Hard to port!
Yo Ho! Our high-flyin' lives are every which way!
When the sun goes down, there's a bon voyage bash.
It ain't sad at all.
As long as we're alive, we'll meet again somewhere!
Blast straight through a headwind, set off!
Stay strong until the tears dry up! A man gotta be tough.
Friends, friends, laugh one day!
As proof of our strong, strong bonds!
Now, grab that map to the shining future!
Lucy, look at that!
Freed vs. Mirajane: Both removed themselves from contention?
So that light from before was... I knew it!
The Demon...
I kinda wish I'd seen it, but then again maybe not...
Anyway, the Raijin Tribe have been wiped out!
Oh, right!
But then there's the Thunder Palace: Thunder lacrima that will attack the entire city...
What should we do about it?
As long as they're protected by the Body Link magic,
attacking them will end up damaging ourselves.
There's not much time left either.
And not being able to get the people in the city to evacuate...
Lucy, are you okay?
Yeah, thanks.
Your magic power hasn't recovered yet.
Don't push yourself.
But there has to be something we can do!
Lucy...
Where are you now, Natsu, Erza?
Clash at Kardia Cathedral!
Where are you, Laxus?
Where the hell are you?
Show yourself, Laxus!
The Thunder Palace... Rendering the judgment of the god of thunder.
There's only 10 minutes until it activates.
Is Laxus really serious?
But it'll work out, right?
We still have Erza and Natsu... And Gajeel's there too!
Oh, yeah! And wasn't Mystogan around?
Although I've never seen him...
I wonder who that could be?
Where is the old fool?
P-Poluchka-san!
What are you doing here?
I asked you where he is.
He's in the inside clinic!
Um, excuse me but... Right now he's...
I know.
That's why I came.
Wait, you came to treat the master?
Um...
Bring Laxus here.
Bring that fool of a boy who's playing around while his grandfather lies gravely ill.
Gravely ill? You're not serious, right?
Just bring him... Please.
He doesn't have long.
Laxus!
Laxus!
You promised to watch Fantasia together with me this year, right?
How about that, Laxus?
Those are Fairy Tail wizards!
Why am I remembering these stupid things now?
Laxus... You aren't going to participate in the Fantasia?
What're you talkin' about, old man?
Since I was little, everyone's always seen me as your grandson!
It doesn't matter what I do, I'm always, Makarov's grandson!
Since I'm always, The master of Fairy Tail's grandson, I can never get credit for what I do!
That really depends on your point of view.
Is there anyone in the world who really gets the credit they deserve?
All he said was that he was uncomfortable, and then you went and shamed him even more!
Well...
Don't you have any sympathy?!
Why?
Why'd you expel my dad?!
Say something!
He...
Ivan... He brought harm to the guild.
Yeah, he did a lot of stupid stuff.
Even so, he's your son!
He's family!
Even be they family,
I cannot allow those who threaten the lives of their comrades to remain in the same guild.
That's how my predecessor protected Fairy Tail before it passed to me.
That is Fairy Tail!
Then kick me out too!
I'll join the guild my dad started up...
He started a guild?
You know where Ivan is now?
As if you actually care.
Nice try.
W-Wait, Laxus!
He left here in the possession of information that could harm Fairy Tail!
I have to find him, or Fairy Tail's in trouble!
That's rich, coming from the one that threw him out...
Laxus...
One day I'll surpass you.
Not for my dad.
But for myself!
For me to become my own man!
The time is ripe.
Old man, I will surpass you!
Six minutes until the Thunder Palace activates.
Is he not gonna step down?
What a stubborn old fool, as usual.
Oh? You came, Mystogan?
I didn't think you'd be participating in this game!
If you call off the Thunder Palace right now,
it is still possible to pass this off as merely entertainment.
So blissfully ignorant...
Haven't you heard the rumors figuring who is the strongest in Fairy Tail, you or me?
Although I don't really care, aren't you forgetting Erza?
Her? Not a chance.
She's on the right track, but still weak.
Erza, weak?
Are you truly that blind?
I'm saying I recognize your skills, Mystogan.
I wonder which one of us is really the strongest in Fairy Tail?
If that is all your eyes can see, I wonder who is the one so blissfully ignorant?
Let's settle this.
We'll decide who's the strongest!
Mystogan...
Or rather, another...
The church?
Kardia Cathedral?
Where did you learn of that?
Oh? That's quite rare to see you panic...
Where did I find out?
Who knows? Maybe I'll tell you if you beat me.
You will regret this, Laxus.
You will now witness magic that you have never seen before!
Ooh, scary.
Give me your best shot, buddy.
I'll show you just how different we two are!
Tower of Babel.
What the...
Impossible!
The entire cathedral?
What the hell is this magic?
What a joke!
You thought this illusion would actually work on me, Mystogan?
Impressive.
But you noticed just a bit too late.
Sleep.
Five Layered Magic Circle, Sacred Song!
Which one of us is the one who didn't notice?
No!
He slipped out?
You ain't bad!
Laxus!
Erza!
Natsu!
You got out?
And, who's that?
Mystogan?
You let down your guard!
Jellal?
You're...
Jellal...
Y-You're alive?
Oh, a familiar face?
W-What's going on here?
Are you Mystogan... or Jellal?
Jellal...
Erza, I especially didn't want you to see.
I am not Jellal.
I know of him, but I am not him.
I apologize.
I leave the rest to you.
Hey, you!
Now I'm all confused...
I'll deal with that later.
Laxus, I came here to fight!
Erza, you'll let me handle him, right?
Erza!
Don't go making ugly faces, Erza!
Now come at me!
Laxus!
I said that I'd fight you, bastard!
What? You were here, Natsu?
I wouldn't underestimate me!
Now fight me, Laxus!
Natsu...
You are so annoying, always charging straight in!
Get lost, small fry!
Talons of the Fire Dragon!
Natsu!
Don't worry about me.
You ain't gettin' away, see?
You think I was running?
This is a chance to take the top spot!
I'll crush you!
Erza...
I must forget about Jellal... I mean, Mystogan for the time being.
Right now, it's Laxus.
Requip!
Erza!
What are those things floating in the sky, Laxus?
It's the Thunder Palace.
Haven't you heard of it?
You're seriously intending to attack Magnolia, you fiend?
It's a new rule!
It really pains my heart...
You vile fiend!
Only two minutes left.
Natsu, destroy them all!
I can't!
Or I mean, if I do that, then I'll get destroyed myself!
What?
So that means, Body Link magic?
Yes!
No one can touch those lacrima!
You coward!
I'll destroy you with my lightning as well!
Requip!
Oh?
Thunder Empress armor?
You seriously think that'll protect you from my lightning?
It's not just about defense, Laxus!
Just try and block this, Erza!
Not bad.
When two wizards of the same type clash, the factors that determine the outcome...
Whoever has the highest magical power...
And their technique and experience, right?
And, their heart!
You should have learned this from the master!
Oh, I learned.
I learned that the most important thing is power.
It's villains like you who...
Erza, stopped gettin' all revved up!
I told you, I'll be the one to take on Laxus!
Guess I'll believe in you then.
Hey, where are you going?
Wait, are you going to stop the Thunder Palace?
You don't have a chance!
Just destroying one risks your life.
And right now there are countless lacrima up there.
There's no time either!
I will destroy them all at the same time.
Impossible!
And if you did, you really wouldn't survive!
But the city would be saved.
Stop Laxus, Natsu!
Hey!
Are you gonna break the rules of the game?
Guess I should believe in you too, Erza.
I don't mean what's possible or impossible...
Believing in you coming back safe!
Natsu...
Mine is a life that you saved.
I won't go throwing it away.
Damn it!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
I will defeat you!
You little brat...
Blades, lend me the power to protect the city of Magnolia.
Also, to everyone in Fairy Tail...
Lend me your power!
Hey, did you just hear Erza's voice?
Yeah, I heard it, I think.
She said to lend her our power.
Aye.
She wants us to help her?
That's not like you, Erza.
I see...
If I can get Erza's voice to reach everyone like it reached me...
For that, I need Warren's help!
Dazzling Blaze of the Fire Dragon!
You should realize this, Natsu!
Don't you see how pitiful this guild has become?
I will change the guild!
And to do that, I must become the master!
Where is everyone?
Now of all times, we can't find anyone!
Warren Rocko!
Are you there, Warren?
Still a minute and thirty seconds until the Thunder Palace activates?
What the hell are you doing, old man?
Don't you know what'll happen to the city?
No need to be so worried, Laxus!
'Cause nothing's gonna happen!
What?
You won't get anything from destroying the city.
So now you're gettin' upset cause you can't get out of it...
Don't worry, Erza will stop it.
It ain't so easy to stick to your guns, is it Laxus?
Like you have a clue!
100!
Still, not enough...
Let's go!
That time we laughed, saying we're both like each other,
we even kindly overlooked the little lies.
If we lose a place to go back to together, I don't care.
Because I'll protect that smile.
The meetings and partings numerous as the stars in the sky...
All the things I don't want to lose...
Right now I feel like I don't need any of them.
I just want to see you by my side,
all my happiness and sadness.
Let's start from here.
Let's start our tomorrow.
Let's do it like we've just been reborn.
Like flowers blown in a summer wind,
let us bloom brightly in this instant.
Natsu, it seems like we'll get another Dragon Slayer joining the fray next time.
Hey, I'm fine on my own!
That's just gonna dilute my star presence!
I think it's already pretty weak.
Hey now... I'm workin' so hard here!
Working hard to suck?
Next time: Triple Dragon!
So there's me, and Gajeel, and...
Wait, who's the other one?
Could it be that I am actually the Fish Dragon Slayer...
Uh, no.
