The S Class Wizard Advancement Exam has finally begun!
The first test is to choose a battle route,
and win your way through...
But Natsu's opponent was Gildarts, right off the bat!
It was tough going, but that's'cause I held back a little.
Nice try there.
That's Tenroujima.
Are you sure it's okay for us to follow them there?
Why not? We're just going to watch.
Worried about Wendy, I see.
Even though I was so dead-set against it, she...
Mest.
It happened a week ago...
Hey, Wendy.
And you are?
I'm Mest. I was Mystogan's disciple.
Mystogan's disciple?!
I've heard quite a lot about you from Mystogan!
Um, what are you doing?
I want to know what the snow tastes like.
Don't worry about me.
Okay...
What's with this guy?
Would you lend me a hand?
Is that any attitude to have when asking favors?!
Apologies... When I want to know something,
I have a tendency to get obsessed about it.
Wendy... With your power, I can get to know the world of an S Class wizard.
Please, lend me your aid.
But, someone like me...
Of course not!
I want to know.
I want to know what the river is like in winter.
Don't go along with this weirdo! Absolutely not!
But he doesn't seem like a bad person.
Yes, he does!
I wasn't able to return all the kindness Mystogan showed me at all...
You saved Edolas! That's plenty!
But that was more just how things turned out...
It wasn't about how I felt...
Don't! Just don't!
And in the end, she decided to help Mest in Mystogan's stead.
And that's why you haven't spoken this past week.
She's a lot more stubborn than she looks.
Same to you.
I don't care really about this Mest guy.
It's the exam as a whole I have a really bad feeling about.
Your power to see the future, is it?
I'm not sure... It's too fragmented, so I can't say.
I'm curious about this Mest fellow.
Mystogan's disciple... It doesn't sit right.
I want to know. I want to know your abilities.
Mest-san, they're going to attack!
Of all the people, it's Mest and Wendy we get to fight with...
I ain't holding back!
Ice Make... Hammer!
When did he...
Power... Power of the heavens!
Roar of the Sky Dragon!
Regulus, grant me the power!
That's some force, all right...
Ice Make Floor!
All that's left is Wendy!
I ain't gonna hold back, either!
Just Eating Pickled Plums!
I'm not even eating them, but just watching makes my mouth pucker up!
Is this some kind of transmission magic?
I can only run!
Regulus at full brightness!
Elsewhere, the pair of Evergreen and Elfman have engaged Mirajane.
She who strikes first wins! Stone Eyes!
As long as I don't look you in the eyes, that magic doesn't work!
And can you dodge these while looking away?
Fairy Machine Gun Leprechaun!
Evergreen!
Neechan... You're serious about this, I see.
Full Body Take Over! Beast Soul!
The finishing blow.
Wait!
I'll blow the both of you away, Evergreen.
I'll tell you something you might want to know.
Mest-san!
I didn't realize those guys would be so strong...
Well, sure they're strong!
But, I'm going to follow in Mystogan's footsteps!
I can't lose!
Bring it on, Gray, Loke!
Huh?
Um... We lost.
I didn't know that!
While you were unconscious, Gray-san and Loke-san went on ahead.
So this year's no good, either?
It's because I wasn't any help...
Even though I decided to try as hard as I could...
Well, it's okay. Anyway, you're not hurt?
No...
Right on! We cleared the first test!
Although if Natsu, for example, lost against Fried in the first test,
I'd feel better about what's coming up.
Well, Cana might be a tough one.
Don't be a fool. There's no such thing as an easy path to becoming an S Class wizard.
I know, I know.
I was just thinking we did well by beating Mest...
Speaking of which... Was he always that weak?
Putting Wendy aside... I thought he was stronger before.
It's that we've gotten stronger.
Huh? I can't remember.
Have I fought with him before?
Oh? Memory loss now, too? Lucy'll think that's hot.
Hmm... Mest said that he got pretty far in last year's exam...
Yes, he did...
He... Who was his partner last time?
Huh? Who was it, again?
Why is it? I can't remember at all...
Neither can I.
I can tell something is hazy about my memories of Mest.
It's true... It's like my memories of Mest are broken off somewhere.
Gray, Loke!
I figured you two would pass the first test!
Congratulations, for now.
We were lucky and got the peaceful route.
Lucky?! I didn't get to smack anyone!
So we're the only ones to pass the first exam?
Where's Natsu?
He's over there.
What's wrong with him?
What happened?
You see...
Now then, I think everyone is here.
Master!
I will now announce the results, to date.
Cana and Lucy defeated Fried and Bickslow in battle, and passed through!
What?!
Natsu and Happy managed to get past Gildarts somehow, and passed through!
You've gotta be kiddin' me!
I didn't do anything, though.
Levy and Gajeel passed through the peaceful route with good luck!
You're sayin' I got good luck?!
Gray and Loke defeated Mest and Wendy in battle, and passed through!
Did Juvia fail?
W-What, Gramps?
Juvia and Lisanna hit upon... her.
That female knight who knows not the meaning of holding back!
The End.
We lose.
Then all that's left is Elfman and Evergreen.
But if we consider what's left, they must have taken the route...
Mirajane...
Sucks to be them.
Well, I could still have won.
Hold it!
We beat Oneechan!
We've passed through the first test!
Incredible!
How did you beat Mira?!
I can't say... As a Man.
Let's just say we managed to find an opening to slip through.
What the heck did they do, I wonder?
Natsu and Happy, Gray and Loke,
Levy and Gajeel, Cana and Lucy,
Elfman and Evergreen.
Those five teams.
Now we will begin the second test!
Natsu, how long are you going to sulk?
No... Just thinking about something.
Natsu is! Thinking about! Something!
How little do you take him for?
Let's fight again sometime.
Get out there and become an S Class wizard, Natsu.
I hear you, Gildarts.
Gray, Cana, Levy, Elfman!
Let's fight and see just who'll become an S Class wizard!
You, especially, I ain't gonna lose to.
Neither will I.
As a Man, I will take on that challenge!
I'm gettin' fired up!
Aye, sir!
I'm gonna make Cana S Class, no matter what!
Even if I'm fighting you, Lucy, I won't hold back.
Keep barkin', strays.
Those who would be Men!
Elfman, get it together!
Doesn't look good for those two.
Now then, I will announce the details for the second test of the S Class Wizard Advancement Exam!
The second test is searching for the grave of Mavis, our founding Guild Master.
Founding Guild Master?
Mavis's grave...
Huh? That sounds easy!
Aye!
You have only 6 hours!
Hear that? I said 6 hours.
I'll be waiting at Mavis's grave.
Righto! Let's go, Happy!
Aye, sir!
Around that time, Wendy...
How long are you going to stay like that?
Because... Because...
So, Wendy... Do you know why this island is called Fairy Tail's Holy Ground?
Because it's where its founding Guild Master, Mavis, rests.
Right. But that's not all.
This island is usually hidden by a powerful barrier.
No matter what magic you use, you wouldn't be able to find it, I hear.
And that's because there's more here than just Mavis's grave.
Apparently, a big secret relating to Fairy Tail is hidden on this island.
What could that be?
Don't ask me.
How about it? Want to explore?
The Prince... I mean, Mystogan, tried to avoid contact with the people of this world.
I heard that he would put everyone to sleep so as not to show his face in the guild.
It's difficult for me to think he'd take on a disciple.
What are you trying to say?
It's a pretty out-there hypothesis, however...
What a pretty place!
Be careful.
Is Mest really a member of the guild?
What's this?!
Hurry, Lucy!
This island is nuts...
I might die here.
To become S class, this ain't nothin'!
Way to put on a brave face!
Over here, Evergreen!
Shut up! Don't order me around!
Don't get...
Bad luck for the ones who showed up in front of Natsu.
Good job as always, Natsu. Let's move on.
No, wait, Happy.
Tell me where the grave of the founding master is!
He's talking to it!
I don't know...
Oh.
It talked!
But, having us search for a grave without even a hint...
This second test might be harder than we thought.
Oh yeah... Wasn't this island shaped like this?
Yeah.
That top seem suspicious to you?
Totally!
Right! I knew partnering with you was the right choice!
To the top, Happy!
Aye, sir!
This is the examiner's base on Tenroujima.
What?! Elfman and Evergreen are getting married?
And while I was still blanked out, they landed some attacks.
Hold it!
When's the wedding? And wait, when did those two start...
No... I think it was just a plan to throw me off guard.
Guess I have a long way to go.
Is it really just a plan?
Those two? I don't really see it.
I mean, if they get married and have a kid...
Don't cry, Mira... It's cute the way you imagined it.
Elf-niichan and Evergreen... They're kind of birds of a feather, actually.
K-K-Kids...
By the way, where's Fried?
They went back to the guild with Gildarts.
That was fast... I wish I could have seen him off.
Anyway, where did Mest and Wendy go?
They're late.
Did they forget the meeting place?
Kids...
Mest, huh?
Kids...
I didn't meet him in Edolas, so I don't know much.
He joined during the two years I was away, right?
Did he?
I feel like he's always been there...
Not much of a presence, I guess.
Juvia will go look for them.
It is a little worrying...
Then I'll go as well.
Mira, Lisanna, stay here.
But Juvia wanted to go cheer on Gray-sama!
Those who are Men should not run from their enemies!
Shut up! Can't you just be quiet?!
Watch out!
Oww...
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
That thing from before was a tactic to throw Mira off her guard! An act!
I sure hope you didn't start thinking that I had a thing for you!
Not even for a second.
But I am thankful.
That was one excellent under-handed plan you thought up.
Don't call it under-handed.
People?
People? On this island, people?
And I'd thought there wouldn't be anyone at this place.
Who the hell are you?
Only members of our guild can enter here.
Guild? Oh... So this island was controlled by a guild.
Hey, you!
Don't!
You mustn't get close to me...
What the hell are you saying?
I know. I'll leave.
But, please...
Don't get close to me.
What's with this guy?
Can we just leave him alone?
I-It's no use!
Here it comes!
The predatory death...
Get down!
Natsu?
Who...
Who are you?!
Maybe it's a little late, but why are you blue if you're a cat, Happy?
More like, 100 episodes too late.
How am I supposed to know that, anyway?
But I'm sure there's got to be a reason.
An old passerby told me that everything in this world has meaning, you know.
An old passerby?
Not someone important from long ago?
Next time: Black Wizard.
Maybe it's because I'm like the bluebird of happiness?
My name is Happy, and I have wings and fly!
Yeah, but you're a cat.
