Bell-kun, are we at that town yet?
Just a little more, I think, Goddess.
Hang in there.
This was supposed to be a date for just you and me, Bell-kun...
So what are all those people doing here?
Bell-sama, look!
Huh? Okay.
The monsters visit this floor just as we do.
It would be more appropriate to call this
the monsters' paradise, instead of ours.
Goddess, this world is beautiful, isn't it?
That's right, Bell-kun.

This is Livira.
It's a town founded by adventurers.
Th-That's crazy!
This whetstone is 13,000 valis!
No way!
This beat-up old bag is 20,000 valis?
How is that even legal?
If you don't want to buy, that doesn't bother me.
The inns here are absurdly expensive, too.
That's why we camp in the forest.
I see.
Huh?
Where's the Goddess?
Over there.
You're right.
When did she
I-I'm sorry.
It's that rookie kid from the bar!
You're going to pay for what happened back there
Um, I...
Hey, Moldo.
You know the Sword Princess?
We're leaving.
What's with them?
So lame.
Bell-kun! Bell-kun!
Ta-da!
What do you think?
It smells good!
Right? Right?
I knew you'd say that.
You bought something like that here?
You don't know how to spend money.
You bought that backpack, didn't you?
We need this to get back to the surface!
I didn't have a choice!
And I need my perfume, too!
It's a maiden's necessity.
Bell-kun, you don't like sweaty girls, do you?
I've never thought about that.
Hestia-sama, we're all going to take a bath after this.
Want to come with us?
Really? Sure do! I sure do!
I-I'll go, too!
We'd like to come, too!
Okay, let's go!
What is it, Hermes-sama?
Bell-kun, once we get back to camp, can I have a little of your time?
Good work, Bete.
Hauling antidotes is a pain, don't make me do
it!
Thanks to you, we can leave for the surface in the morning.
We'll be splitting into two groups,
and you should go with the first
What's the bunny brat doing here?
Oh, some stuff happened.
What do you mean, some stuff?
Um, Hermes-sama...
I followed you here because you said you wanted to speak alone.
But why are we climbing a tree?
You'll understand if you follow.
Uh...
But...
Look below, Bell-kun.
I win, hands-down!
Why are you comparing yourself to the others, Hestia-sama?
The girls are bathing.
Obviously, we're going to peek.
That's not obvious at all!
This is wrong, Hermes-sama!
Bell-kun, peeking is part of a man's romance.
Bell, peeking is part of a man's romance.
Grandpa!
RRRomance!
Grandpa!
Let's go back, Hermes-sama!
Hey, it's the Argonaut!
What, did you come to take a bath, too?
I had you pegged as the quiet type. I'm impressed.
No way...
Um... um...
What are you doing, Bell-sama?
Oh, Bell-kun, you're so silly.
I'm sorry!
Huh?
Where am I?
What do I do?
The sound of water?
Who's there?
I-I'm sorry!
Cranel-san!
I see.
I understand what happened.
There's no need to worry about it.
Y-You're going to forgive me?
You don't think I'm lying?
Cranel-san.
Humility is a virtue.
But do not insult yourself.
It's a bad habit of yours.
I-I'm sorry.
Um...
It's a little late for this,
but thanks for coming all this way to save me.
Don't worry about it.
I was planning on coming here sometime soon, anyway.
Mama Mia gives me time off, every so often, to bring them flowers.
Ryu-san, is this...
It's the grave of the familia I belonged to once.
An enemy familia set a trap for us in the dungeon,
and everyone but me was killed.
Cranel-san,
would you listen to my story?
Uh, sure.
I'm blacklisted from the guild.
I wiped out that enemy familia.
Night attacks. Surprise attacks. Traps.
Driven by rage, I avenged my comrades, doing whatever was necessary.
And when I'd had my revenge,
I collapsed in a dark, abandoned alleyway.
It would have been a fitting end for one who behaved so stupidly.
But...
Are you okay?
So you work at the Benevolent Mistress now?
Yes. Mama Mia knew everything, and yet she still took me in.
I'm sorry to tell you such an awful tale.
N-No, it's fine...
As for my point... I'm a shameless, violent elf.
Enough so that I might betray your trust.
Ryu-san.
Please do not insult yourself.
I can get mad, too.
My.
You've got me there.
Oh, I'm sorry. That was rude of me.
Cranel-san, you're very kind.
You are a human worthy of my respect.
Damn it!
Wow, you're pissed off, Moldo!
Shut up!
What trick did that brat use to get down here?
That cocky little asshole...
What, are you jealous?
Huh?
This is your problem, too.
A bratty little rookie got down here practically the day he leveled up.
We've been here for years, which means we're a joke!
Adventurers have their own rules. We'll just have to teach him that.
If we can just get him alone...
You're...
Bunny brat!
You saw Aiz naked?
You got to do something even I can't, you bastard!
Shut up. Stop talking about that.
We blamed the whole thing on Hermes-sama.
You guys are so mean!
Let me go, you stupid amazon!
What's he doing here, anyway?
Stop talking already.
You're leaving, too, Aiz-san?
Yes. I've been assigned to the party that's leaving first.
You're going with the second party, right?
Yes.
Um...
Take care.
You, too. Take care.
That Bell-kun...
If he wanted to peek, he should've come when I was alone!
Huh?
Goddess?
Little Rookie.
We have your goddess.
If you want her back,
come to the lone, tall crystal on the far east side of the central forest.
Hey! Do you really think you can get away with this?
I may not look like it, but I'm a goddess!
Why you... Take that!
Hey.
Where's my goddess?
Follow me!
Your goddess is safe.
I'm not shameless enough to hurt her.
Then you're here for me.
Don't worry.
I won't let them interfere.
We're about to have a fight. Just you and me.
A duel.
A duel...
That's right. Simple, isn't it?
The winner can tell the loser to do whatever he wants.
If I win, I'm taking all your equipment.
If I win, please release my goddess.
Sure thing.
But don't get the wrong idea, brat.
In this show, I'm gonna kick the crap out of you!
He's gone!
You really can't see him!
Get him, Moldo!
Snap the Rookie brat in half!
It's too early for your nap!
Now get back in there!
What are you doing?
You're the Rookie all eyes are on, huh?
Look at that face!
The magic item, Hades Head.
Splendid work, Asfi.
You have some nasty hobbies.
Do you have something against Bell Cranel?
No. You could say this is my love.
Bell-kun doesn't know enough about the ugly side of humanity.
Nasty or not, I wanted him to learn this about people.
I won't deny that part of it's the entertainment, though.
And if his fangs are broken here?
That means he was never right for the job.
Oh?
Looks like they've found out, too.
They're all so dazzlingly bright...
Who the hell did that?
Bell should be just past them!
Cowards!
It's the Little Rookie's buddies!
How did they find us?
It doesn't matter!
Get them!
Chigusa, my spear!
Right!
What's going on?
Hey!
Sounds like they're having fun.
Damn it, I wanna go see!
Hey, don't ignore me!
Want to go?
Yeah, let's go!
Hey!
You're...
The midnight bell tolls.
S-Supporter, how did you...
I used my chienthrope sense of smell.
It's thanks to the perfume you wasted your money on.
Burn, dark magics!
Will o' wisp!
Damn you!
Screw these guys!
Don't be scared! We outnumber them!
Surround them!
Damn! We can't get close to Bell!
Take this!
It seems you haven't learned your lesson.
You...
I'm here to help.
R-Right.
Was that a coincidence?
You can see me?
I can feel his eyes on me.
Damn it!
I'll chop you in half, asshole!
You stupid brat!
Stop!
Goddess!
Stop.
Children, sheathe your swords.
Wait, you guys!
Oh dear. Hestia's released her divine power?
I guess our fun for the day is over!
Bell-kun!
Bell-kun, I'm so glad you're safe!
I'm so glad!
G-Goddess...
I'm sorry you got beaten up so badly over me...
No, I'm sorry that I couldn't protect you.
Well, that's that...
An earthquake?
I don't like this shaking.
Hey, what the hell is that?
