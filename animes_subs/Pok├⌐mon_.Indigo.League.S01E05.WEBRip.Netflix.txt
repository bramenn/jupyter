-Jessie. -James.
Meowth. I don't get why you two are always talking
and I'm stuck doing all the work!
We haven't got much time.
If they're headed for Pewter City, they'll have to pass this way!
And they'll fall right into our trap.
Come on! Dig it deep, then we'll cover it up so well
they'll never guess it's a trap!
Ah! I can't even tell where the trap is!
-Wasn't it here? -Is this it?
-Where did it go! -It's over there.
Hm.
Hm? Huh?
Continuing his quest to become the world's greatest Pokemon trainer,
Ash finally finds his way out of the Viridian Forest.
No doubt some new and surprising challenges lie ahead
for Ash, Pikachu and Misty!
-Yay, Pewter City! -Phew.
For a while there, I thought I was going to be in this forest
-for the rest of my life. -Chu.
Pewter City is gray, the color of stone.
This town has always been famous for stone.
Huh? What the...? Who's this old guy?
Never met him.
The name's Flint.
And you're sitting on some of my merchandise, young man.
Oh, sorry!
Uh, you mean you sell rocks?
They're Pewter City souvenirs. Want to buy some?
No, thanks. I'm traveling, trying to become a Pokemon trainer.
Uh-huh.
Well, your Pokemon sure looks worn out.
Why don't you follow me? I'll show you to the Pokemon Center.
See, looks can be deceiving. He's a nice guy.
Are you sure?
By the way, that'll be a S2 charge for resting on my rocks.
Ah!
Please revitalize my Pokemon.
-Sure, right away, Ash! -Huh? Nurse Joy?
Yes, I'm Nurse Joy.
But this isn't Viridian City. This is Pewter City.
The Joy in Viridian City is my little sister.
I'm the older Joy.
I've heard nice things about you, very nice.
-Uh, thank you. -Have you seen that poster?
The Pokemon League Regional Championships!
All right!
- Ha! -Huh? What's the matter?
To compete in the regional championships,
you need to beat Gym trainers from different towns
and get their badges as proof.
-Can you do that? -Of course I can!
Don't tell me you plan on challenging Brock,
the Pewter City Gym Leader.
Of course I do.
As soon as Pikachu and my other Pokemon are better, I'll have no problem.
Take me to this Brock's Gym. I'll beat him!
You'll beat him, heh.
Ooh, that Flint, trying to make a fool out of me.
Do you really think you can win?
Gym leaders are different from your everyday Pokemon trainer.
They're much, much tougher.
I'll tell you what, Ash, if you ask me really nicely, I'll help you out.
I don't need any help.
Huh? Is that so? Fine with me.
There's no way you'll beat Brock in the Pewter City Gym. Huh!
Hey, you can't leave me with the bill! Come back here!
Well, Ash, no more waiting.
Pikachu and your other Pokemon are all back to normal.
-Oh, that's great! -Chu!
All right!
So this is Pewter Gym? All right, then.
Hello!
- Who goes there? -Huh? Oh!
So, you must be Brock. I'm Ash from Pallet Town.
I challenge you!
-Is this your first Gym match? -Um...
A Gym match is different from other battles.
This match is for Pokemon League authorization.
There are special rules.
Um, what do you mean by special rules?
We will use two Pokemon each, understood?
Oh.
How long have you been with that Pokemon?
Uh, about two weeks, I guess.
Yes, your Pikachu is in its cutest stage!
-Ka-chu. - It can't win.
I'll worry about my Pokemon and you worry about yours, all right?
Suit yourself.
As Gym Leader, I have to accept every challenge,
so let's just get this over with.
Whoa! Oh!
Ah. Let the match begin.
All right. Okay, Pikachu, I choose you, buddy.
Pikachu!
Onix, go!
Pika...
Chu. Pikachu.
Hey, this is your battle, Pikachu, not Pidgeotto's! Go.
Pika, pika? Chu!
-Onix, tackle attack! -Chu!
Chu, chu!
Onix, bind it now!
Unh! Pikachu, Thundershock!
Pika!
You haven't raised it very well.
Such a weak electric attack can't hurt Onix!
-Chu. -Pikachu, return!
It's being blocked. I can't bring it back.
Chu!
Argh! Cut it out!
Do you surrender?
I... I do.
Huh?
Come with me.
Everyone loses sometimes. You can't let that get you down.
I know, but I didn't just lose. I stunk!
Brock's way better than me.
I could never enter a league match if I can't beat him.
Brock is very good.
His own talents could take him much further
than simply being the local Gym Leader.
Yeah, but why has he never been in a regional championship himself?
-He has his reasons. -Huh?
I tore my skirt!
All right, all right, I'll sew it up for you.
Huh?
Is it done yet?
Just a minute.
Wow, I sure never thought of Brock like that.
Brock has ten little brothers and sisters to take care of
so he could never leave town for regional championships.
Doesn't he have a mom or a dad?
His good-for-nothing father left the family to become a Pokemon trainer
and they never heard from him again.
Brock's heartbroken mother tried her best to hold things together
but sadly, she passed away.
Brock's the only one his little brothers and sisters have left.
I better not listen to any more sad stuff.
Next time I have a match with Brock, I might not have the heart to beat him!
But... But you said that...
You said you could never win a match with Brock!
Yeah, well, I changed my mind about that!
If I can power up Pikachu, I'll beat him!
Hmm, I may just know a way you can supercharge Pikachu.
Hey, you do?
- What is this place? - A hydroelectric plant.
The river turns the wheel and makes electricity
and if you can hook Pikachu up to it,
you might be able to give it a power boost.
Thanks, Mr. Flint. That's a great idea!
Gee, how do you know so much about Pokemon, huh?
Me? Uh, you see, I, uh...
Well, I just got lucky, I guess. That's it, lucky.
Well, Pikachu, get ready to power up!
Pikachu!
Of course right now the river is dry.
Ah!
Then what did we come here for?
I have another idea.
-Pikachu is all hooked up. -Okay.
Ah!
All right!
Pi...
Take it easy, Pikachu.
All this power may be shocking at first, but sooner or later,
your body will get used to the high voltage!
Hey, Ash. Wouldn't it be a lot better to just ask me for help
instead of going with this crazy power plan of yours?
Forget it! I'll win without your help.
Huh?
Huh! What do I care?
I'm going to get a badge all by myself using the Pokemon I'm training!
Stubborn. It'd be a lot easier if he used some of mine too.
If I can take this, you can take it, Pikachu!
Hang in there, Pikachu.
Huh?
Pi!
I'm back!
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?
Ah! We're ready for you this time, Brock!
Heh, we'll see.
- Pi! - Two Poke Balls.
Got it!
I'll start with... Geodude, go!
Geodude.
Pidgeotto, I choose you!
Go, pidgeotto! Gust Attack!
-Huh? -Bad strategy.
Don't you know flying Pokemon are weak against Rock Types?
Oh, guess I forgot.
Come on, Ash. Use your head.
Pidgeotto, return!
-Are you giving up again, Ash? -No way.
-Pikachu, I choose you! -Chu!
The Pikachu again.
I feel sorry for it, being raised by such a weak Pokemon trainer.
Pikachu, now's our chance to show him how weak we are!
Pikachu!
Pikachu, nice going.
Return, Geodude.
It looks like you've trained it better. But still, it's no match for Onix!
Go!
Pika!
Hey, Pikachu, watch where you're aiming, huh?
-Chu! -Oh, Pikachu, give it a Thunderbolt!
Hang in there, Pikachu! It's working!
Onix, bind it!
-Chu! -Pikachu.
- Onix, stop! -Huh?
No, Brock, I want to play this match to the end.
There's no point in going on.
I really don't want to hurt your Pokemon.
- Ash! -Ah. Huh?
Rock Pokemon are weakened by water!
-Pikachu! -Chu!
Onix!
Pikachu, finish it off!
My conscience is holding me back. I can't bring myself to beat Brock.
I'm imagining his little brothers and sisters
stopping me from beating the one person they love.
Ash, I think you'd better open your eyes.
-Huh? -You leave Onix alone!
Our brother worked hard to raise him, you big bully.
Believe me, kid, I'm no bully.
Stop it. Get off, all of you!
This is an official match and we're going to finish it no matter what!
But, Brock, we know that you love your Pokemon so much.
That's why we can't watch Onix suffer from another attack!
Onix, stop!
-Pikachu, return! -Chu?
What do you think you're doing? This match isn't over yet, Ash.
Those sprinklers going off was just an accident.
Winning the match because of that wouldn't have proved anything.
Next time we meet, I'll beat you my way, fair and square.
Maybe.
Just when he finally gets a lucky break,
he decides to be a nice guy too.
I'm sorry if I was too tough on you, Pikachu.
But you really did a great job.
Pikachu.
Sounds like you feel just the way I do.
Hey, hey, wait up! Ash!
Huh? Brock?
Ash, you forgot this.
A badge for defeating a Gym Trainer.
I can't accept that. I didn't beat you.
-I gave up. -Nah.
I lost to you.
You beat me in battle and in being kind to all Pokemon.
But...
To tell you the truth, I get more pleasure from raising Pokemon
than from making them battle.
I don't care about being a great Pokemon trainer.
I want to become the world's best breeder
but I can't leave here because I have to look after my brothers and sisters.
Ash, I want you to take this and fulfill my dream.
-Will you do that for me? -I will.
And I'll do my best to deserve this too!
Brock, you go follow your own dreams.
Flint!
-My father. -Huh?
You mean you're the good-for-nothing father who left home and never came back?
That's right. It was me.
I couldn't become the great Pokemon trainer I wanted to
and because I was such a failure,
I was too embarrassed and ashamed to go back to my family.
But why did you help me instead of Brock?
You reminded me of myself.
-You didn't seem to have a chance. -Oh!
Its time I started taking care of my family.
You go fulfill your dreams and mine.
First, there are some things I have to tell you.
After all these years, I understand how you must feel about me
so I want you to get everything off your chest. Here.
Uh...
Suzy always rips her dresses so you better learn how to sew.
And Timmy only eats cold spaghetti for breakfast.
Tommy likes corn flakes for dinner-
Slow down, slow down. I can't write that fast!
Cindy sleepwalks so you have to tie a bell on her wrist.
The twins never want to take a bath so you have to...
Hey, Ash, are you sure it's okay if I go with you on your Pokemon journey?
Sure I'm sure.
The more the merrier and it's good to have somebody to talk with.
Well, what about that girl who keeps following you?
Don't forget about my bike, Ash Ketchum!
I'm going to follow you till you pay me back!
I know, I know!
-Pikachu, let's try to lose her. -Chu!
-Wait up, Ash! -You won't get away!
And so with a new friend and ally and Misty close behind
Ash continues on his quest to become a Pokemon master.
-I told you I'd get us out of this! -This was all...
- Hey, Ash! -
Come back here! Ash, come on!
Buried alive, then trampled.
- We've hit rock bottom! -Meowth!
J Pokemon! J
