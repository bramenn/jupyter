Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
This is... inside of Etherion...?
No, it's...
I see now...
I'm dead?
Erza Scarlet...
In God's grace; God fearing; her heart was as wide as the eternal sky.
Her sword shined nobly for her loved ones...
Her figure a dancing, fluttering fairy. Her beauty was a match for nature itself...
Love makes us stronger, and it is love that makes us weak as well...
Master...
She was like a daughter to me...
The council has decided to award one of the two empty council seats to her in perpetuity.
And name Erza Scarlet as one of the 10 Wizard Saints.
Home.
Screw this!
What the hell is everyone doing?
Natsu...
Stop this, Natsu!
Natsu, stop!
Why, you...
Erza ain't dead!
Please, Natsu... Stop...
There's no way in hell she's dead!
Face reality, Natsu!
Lemme go!
Erza's alive!
I did this for your future and everyone else's, Natsu...
And yet...
This isn't the future I wanted to see...
I just...
I wanted to see everyone smile...
Where am I?
Erza!
What happened?
I'm... alive?
Natsu?
You... saved me...
He found me inside that vortex of magical power?
Incredible...
We're the same.
I couldn't have lived without Fairy Tail.
A world without my friends is unthinkable.
We're all the same.
Never do something like that again.
Natsu...
Never again!
Okay.
Natsu... Thank you.
That's right.
You don't die for your friends.
You live for your friends!
Because that's how you create a happy future!
Is he okay?
He's slept for three days straight...
That's what the freak gets for eating Etherion.
What'd you just say, Gray?!
He's awake!
He's asleep!
If you don't have it in you to pick a fight, don't get up!
I really caused everyone a lot of trouble this time, didn't I?
Come on, how many times have you said that already?
Speaking of which, what happened to her?
Oh, you mean Juvia?
She's headed back already.
She said something about wanting to join Fairy Tail as soon as possible, or something...
I see.
I apologize, Erza.
Sorry, Er-chan.
No. It was I who was not able to do anything for you for eight years.
I am truly sorry...
It's not your fault, Sister!
If I had done something sooner, then Simon might have...
Simon was a true man!
He wanted to protect you.
He always...
Wally!
I know well his feelings.
As well as the feelings of those left behind.
But we must continue on.
To the future that Simon left for us.
If you have no other place to go, then come to Fairy Tail.
Us?
It might be different than the freedom you sought, but...
Salamander did say something like that.
That it was one super spiffy guild!
And I'd like to stay together with you all.
Come now, let's go back.
I have to introduce you all properly to Natsu and the others.
You've really gotten strong, Erza...
Jellal?
It... couldn't be...
After that, Erza said something to me quietly in private.
She said that it might actually have been Jellal who prevented the tower from exploding.
Freed from Zeref's possession, he had returned to the kind Jellal he once was.
He then fused with Etherion in Erza's place and directed the magical power up into the sky.
It does make a lot of sense when you think of it that way.
But it's kind of sad...
It means Jellal was just another victim of Zeref's spirit.
Lucy!
Have you seen Sho or the others?
No, I haven't...
I can't find them anywhere.
Could they have left without telling anyone?
I see...
What happened?
Tell Natsu and Gray to prepare fireworks.
Huh?
Wait...
Do you really think we can make it on our own?
In the outside world?
We have to!
We can't bother Sister any more...
Everyone!
Sister!
We were raised in the tower our entire lives.
There's a lot we don't understand, that we're uncertain of...
But we want to see the outside world for ourselves.
We don't want to live relying on others any longer...
We've had enough of living for someone else!
From now on, we'll live for ourselves!
We want to find our own reason to live!
That is our freedom!
If you keep that strong will, you can accomplish anything.
It reassures me.
However...
There are three conditions for anyone who leaves Fairy Tail!
Listen well.
Leave? But we never even joined...
One!
You must never reveal sensitive information about Fairy Tail to others for as long as you live!
Two!
You must not have unauthorized contact with past clients or profit personally from them!
Three!
Even if we walk different paths, one must always live on as strong as you are able!
You must never treat your own life as something insignificant!
You must never forget the friends you love for as long as you live!
Begin the Fairy Tail Farewell Ceremony!
Yeah!
Let bloom the flowers of light within your hearts.
I wish I could be with you forever...
But if that ends up holding you back, then I wish to bless your newfound voyage.
You've got it backwards, Er-chan!
With us around, you'll be forced to remember all the bad things...
I won't forget you, no matter where you may be.
And it is those painful memories that become the seeds of tomorrow...
They make us stronger...
Humans have that power.
Go on, stronger...
I will continue on, stronger!
If we never forget this day, we will meet again.
Stay well.
You too, Sis!
Bye-bye, Er-chan!
We'll see each other again!
That's a promise!
It's a promise.
This is a surprise.
They finished it?
Our new Fairy Tail!
Is this an outdoor cafe?
There's even a goods shop?
Look, you're a salesman now, Max!
And wait, how long has it been again?
I've been out studying business on Master's orders.
Max Aloze? You've been in Weekly Sorcerer!
Since we've just met, glad to be of service.
I've heard quite a lot about you, Lucy.
I don't even want to imagine what he's heard about me...
Hey, so what are you selling?
T-shirts, wrist bands, mugs, towels...
And the most popular is...
It's a figure of Lucy!
Don't go making something like that without my permission!
And of course, the clothes are cast-off!
How beautiful!
Yes, this is wonderful.
What's the matter, Natsu?
It's different than it was.
Levy-chan!
Great, huh? In the back of the drinking hall is a pool!
Why is there a pool?
It's totally different.
There's a game parlor in the basement.
Yo!
You're back?
It's got everything...
It's different.
And the biggest change is the second floor.
Anyone can go up there now!
Of course you still have to be with an S-class wizard to go on an S-class quest.
You've returned, you bunch of fools?
Master!
This is our new member, Juvia.
Ain't she a cutey?
Juvia is glad to be of service!
So you really joined?
You helped us a lot at Akane.
It's all thanks to you!
Juvia will work hard!
Glad to have you!
Love rival!
Actually, I'm not...
And we have one more new member.
Come on, say hi to everyone.
There's another one?
Hey!
You're got to be joking!
Gajeel!
Why is he...
Wait!
Juvia recommended him!
Juvia is one thing, but he's the very person who destroyed the guild!
Now, now...
They say yesterday's enemies are tomorrow's friends, yes?
Yeah...
I d-don't mind at a-all...
This has got to be some joke!
You expect me to go on jobs with this guy?
Don't worry.
I ain't sharing my work!
Cold as steel!
I just want jobs, that's all.
I can't believe I ended up here in the most annoying guild of all...
Say that again!
Poor Gajeel-kun was always all alone, and Juvia couldn't leave him like that, so...
It's not that kind of relationship though, really!
It is the role of we elders to guide youth from the wrong path to the right one.
Deep down, even he is good.
If that's your decision, Master...
But I think it best to watch him carefully for now.
As you wish.
They're more like dogs than dragons, seriously...
Yeah! That's even lower than cats!
I just don't feel at home here anymore...
We're back, Mira!
We've been waiting, Mira!
Mira-chan!
You're the best, Mirajane!
I brush the desk with you gone...
The shadow drops...
Alone again, today...
Looking up at the starry sky, I say a prayer...
You are now under this same sky...
Glad you all are back...
Even when you're shaking with tears...
Even when it seems like you'll be lost to the darkness...
Fairy Tail's children are sure to continue to grow...
It may be time for me to start thinking about it...
Don't forget...
You always have...
You always have a place to return to...
You always have people waiting for you to return...
Great! Who's next?
W-What?!
I wrote this song myself.
It's called Best Friend.
I hope you like it.
I hope you choke!
And why are you all dolled up in a suit?
Colorful, colorful...
Shooby doo bop!
Tremble with love, steel grey metallic!
He's got chops!
Go for it, Gajeel-kun!
Yeah!
Doo doo doo... Shalala...
Shooby doo bop! Shalala...
Bite into it, hard! Sweet honey...
I've never heard a song this crappy before!
You wanna go?
Shooby do bop!
What do you think you're doing?
I'm shooby doo bopping, you jerk!
Stop it!
So annoying...
Who threw that?
Natsu!
You're goin' overboard!
My... strawberry cake...
Listen up, you all!
Real men don't make such a damn racket!
Silence!
Somebody stop them!
Now this is more like Fairy Tail...
What's the deal calling me out here?
I was thinking about going out on a job...
A job?
You're the guy who destroyed the guild!
You got no right to a job!
You guys sure are petty.
Stop it...
This is how we...
You won't be feeling so confident for long!
Secret Seeds!
Knuckle Plant!
Falcon Heaven's Soar!
Hey...
What're you playing at?
What kind of bullying is this?
Laxus!
So this is the kid that did a number on my guild?
So gramps let someone join to keep the guild from being busted up?
That's exactly why people look down on us!
You little piece of...
On the road back to town, I heard things in bars here and there that really pissed me off.
Fairy Tail ain't anything special...?
Those guys are already through...?
It's your fault!
Stop, Laxus! That's going too far!
I knew Laxus is crazy strong, but...
It's that one-sided?
Wait, is it that Gajeel never even...
Because he wanted us to recognize him as an ally...
He just took it, without defending himself!
I'll teach you what happens to anybody who takes on Fairy Tail!
Stop it, Laxus! That's enough!
The weaklings should stay outta this!
Gajeel?
You satisfied?
I have work to do.
Um...
Leave me alone.
Idiocy...
This isn't the Fairy Tail I have in mind.
I can't take this any longer!
Fairy Tail will be mine!
A tournament to decide the strongest in Fairy Tail?
Sounds like fun.
But Erza and Laxus will be in it too!
There's no way you'll win, Natsu.
I like it!
I'll beat'em all!
Like gnats to a flame.
I see!
What?!
Next time: Battle of Fairy Tail!
Now I'm pissed.
I ain't giving you squat when I win, Happy.
Natsu, your temper will be your downfall.
Shut up already!
