Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Excuse me
Yes, what is it?
Sweetflowers?
By the time you read this letter, I doubt that Ill be alive.
So to you, my most trusted one,
Ill write everything that I have uncovered.
When I first read the captains letter,
I couldnt believe my eyes. I couldnt believe it.
But it is true Ill believe the captain.
Captain Aizen The one who killed you is
Eat.
If you can faint from hunger you have it, too, right?
The power
You, too?
Yeah, me, too.
Im Gin Ichimaru. Pleased to meet you.
Gin What a strange name
You awake, Matsumoto?
Captain
Whatre you doing in my room?
Idiot!
The office isnt your room! If youre awake, take over.
Im beat!
Thats because you went and took all the paperwork for Squad 5s takeover.
Quiet. You finish up.
Is this all? There was so much more
Quiet, I said!
Ive been asleep a long time, havent I?
Never mind.
Your classmate is fighting with your junior.
It must be rough on you.
My classmate, huh
Captain?
Do you really suspect Gin Captain Ichimaru was the one who
Excuse me, sir!
I am Kokichiro Takezoe, Squad 10, 7th Seat!
Are Captain Hitsugaya and Lieutenant Matsumoto here?
What is it? Come in!
Sir!
Pardon me!
Reporting!
An urgent message from the guard stations.
Lieutenant Abarai, Lieutenant Hinamori, and Lieutenant Kira
have vanished from their cells!
Forgive me, sir!
When Lieutenant Hinamori called, and I turned around,
I saw a blinding white light, and I awoke in this state
I haveno excuse for it, sir!
Hakufuku
Hakufuku?
Hinamori is a master of the Kido.
If we truly wished to restrain her,
we should have sealed her Spiritual Pressure.
But that wasnt done because no one expected her to go this far.
Its not like she was under a death sentence.
Why?
Theres only one reason
Matsumoto
Yes?
Go back without me. Im going to save Hinamori!
Hinamori, dont do anything rash!
He now maintains his stance, even when his sword breaks.
Hurry, Ichigo, the deadline is near!
Fifty-one.
This time, for sure!
Keep your eyes on the enemy.
Thats fifty-two.
Dammit. I almost had him
Ichigo
At the moment of impact,
he adjusted to the enemys speed and deflected the blade.
Then, without slowing down,
he shifted instantaneously to counterattack.
Clearly, he no longer relies on the power of Zangetsu, his weapon!
Hes absorbing it
With fearsome speed At a fearsome level
Urahara, you were right. The boy is truly
Oh? Boss, have you caught a cold?
No, some pretty girl is probably talking about me.
Wow, thats such a cliche.
You said something?
No! That will never do!
I have a good remedy for colds.
Remedy?
This expired two years ago!
Its nicely aged.
Thats not right!
Say Aah”
Drink, drink.
Damn! Not yet!
I gottaI gotta save Rukia!
Why does Rukia Kuchiki have to be executed?
Why do they keep moving up the date?
As I was investigating, I came upon the truth.
I want you to know it. In my place
Captain Aizen
Hes been fighting for over five minutes
with this single sword
But its nearing the end
Here goes!
Wha?
Huh?
Lay down your sword, Ichigo. The first day is over.
This way, sir.
This is!
I couldnt tell it was night, already.
You cant tell time here, so you sure get disoriented.
Wh-Whats with this hot spring?! My scars healing like crazy!
Huh?
Awesome! Just awesome!
Would it work if I drank it?!
Ichigo
Hows the bath?
Yeah? Thats good.
Then Ill join you
A-Are you nuts?!
Whatre you doing?!
Aw, whats wrong?
Plentys wrong!
And why do you take off your pants first?!
You always react exactly as expected.
Youre so naIve.
Sh-Shut up! You makin fun of me?!
Agh! Dont come in! N-No!
Theres no problem now, is there?
What? Are you a little disappointed?
Be honest.
Eh?
You creep!
Im gonna drown you!
Hey, Yoruichi
What?
Ive been thinking
This place looks a lot like that place
The Training Ground under Uraharas Shop.
I suppose so.
That place was modeled after this one.
Really?
Yeah.
When Kisuke and I were kids,
we secretly built it as our secret play ground.
Secretly?
This hu-ge spacesecretly?
Its an old story.
When we were kids, we played here almost every day
After he joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads,
and I joined the Stealth Force, we honed our skills here.
W-Wait a minute, Yoruichi!
Yow!
Why sit cross-legged?! Dont sit like that!
Heh. I never get tired of that reaction.
Just tell me more about the old guy!
So he was a Soul Reaper, after all?
Yep.
I thought it was strange.
He knew so much about Soul Society and he had a zanpaku-to.
Tell me, Yoruichi. Who is he, anyway?
Hes the former captain of Squad 12
of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads.
He even founded and served
as the first chief of the Department of Research and Development.
For real?! Didnt know he was that important!
I thought so
What?! Are you trying to kill me?!
I have a good stomach medicine that works wonderfully.
Please wait!
You are trying to kill me!
Ill dig it out from the back yard!
What the heck are they doing?
So youre together, as I suspected.
Captain Hitsugaya!
Just as I thought.
Only Kiras cell was unlocked from the outside.
If you wanted it to be a secret, werent you a little careless?
Ichimaru?
Well, thats a funny thing to say.
I did it on purpose, so youd know.
Its a good thing I got here before Hinamori.
Before she gets here, Ill kill you!
Hinamori!
At lastIve found you.
So you were here
No, Hinamori! Youre no match for him!
Ill handle this. Stay back!
Hinamori?
To avengeCaptain Aizen!
Why did you kill the Captain?!
I know everything
from this letter left by the captain.
Hinamori, the true purpose for this execution
is not to kill Rukia Kuchiki.
This execution was contrived in order to steal a certain object.
Its true objective is The Sokyoku.
The Sokyokus seal is broken only for an execution.
In its blade lies the destructive power of a million zanpaku-to.
It also possesses the defensive ability
to block equally powerful zanpaku-to, as well.
Moreover, when a Soul Reaper is crucified and stabbed with Sokyoku,
its power grows dozens of times over.
The one who plotted this execution plans to use this power
to destroy not only the Seireitei, but Soul Society itself.
And the name of this vile person is
ToshiroHitsugaya
Wha-!
The letter goes on to say
Ive called him out to the Sacred Eastern Wall tonight.
I must stop his plan somehow.
Im resolved to fight him if he wont desist.
But if I should die
Hinamori, wont you carry out my wishes and avenge him?
This is my final request
not as the captain of Squad 5 but as a man.
I ask thisof you!”
Hinamori
You fool! Think carefully!
If he dies, he wants you to fight instead?!
Do you think Aizen would say that?!
The Aizen I know was never stupid enough
to face unbeatable odds alone.
And he was no coward that makes his men bail him out either!
ButBut thats what the letter said!
In Captain Aizens handwriting!
I didnt want to believe it, either!
But thats what Captain Aizen said!
II
I dont know what to do anymoreShiro-chan
Hinamori
Rats.
No good. Shes too upset to think rationally.
But Aizen would never write a letter like that.
Somebody mustve forged it!
So that Hinamori and I would kill each other!
I see. This, too?
Was this all your doing, too?!
Ichimaru?!
Hinamori!
Oh, my. That was cruel, Squad 10 Captain.
The girl was hurt and so desperate. Why hit her so hard?
Ichimaru
The warning certainly came at a convenient time for you.
What are you after?
Ill never forget what you said back then.
Youre always the same.
You should stop and listen to the last alarm, at least.
Soon you wont be able to anymore.
So Aizen wasnt enough for you
You even had to hurt Hinamori this bad!
To make her grip her sword so hard that her hands bled!
Whatever are you talking about?
I told you
If you ever made Hinamori bleed, Id kill you!
That will never do.
Draw your sword in a place like this and Ill be forced to stop you.
Happy people
Come on, come on, come on
Happy people
Here we go!
Everybody stand up! Everybody fight!
Within your heart, you may feel uneasy
But keep your head right up!
To the sky!
No matter when (Oh yeah!)
No matter where (Oh yeah!)
Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!)
Ill be here for you
Happy people in the house!!!
With a tough smile
Happy people in the house!!!
Lets live!
Wow
Happy people in the house

Happy people
Boss, this time for sure,
