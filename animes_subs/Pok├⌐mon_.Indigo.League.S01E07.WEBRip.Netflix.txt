Determined to become a Pokemon Master,
Ash continues on his quest, gaining skill and knowledge
and catching new Pokemon along the way.
His fierce Pokemon battle with Gym Leader Brock earned
Ash a boulder badge and a brand-new friend.
Brock, hoping to be a Pokemon breeder,
decided to join Ash and Misty on their journey.
Gary was here, Ash is a loser.
But with his rival Gary way ahead of him,
Ash Ketchum is still playing catch-up.
We can only wonder what adventures lie ahead.
Ah, it's a great day to just enjoy the sunshine.
And while you're enjoying the sunshine,
-Gary's catching more Pokemon. -Ah!
But I guess a Pokemon trainer can capture Pokemon and enjoy the sun.
Pika.
Hey! Wait a minute!
Cha.
-Where do you think you're going? -Oh, I know where we're going.
-We're going to Cerulean City. -Ah! Cerulean City?
What are you going there for?
Well, it's none of your business, but I'm going for more badges.
Uh, Ash, you don't want Pokemon from there. Trust me.
-Why not? -Because they're all...
All what?
Like monsters.
Nice face, Misty. Come on, Brock. Let's go, Pikachu.
Hey, hey! Wait a second! Hey, what about Vermilion City?
It's right on the water and there are lots of neat Pokemon
and you can watch all the giant yachts pulling into the harbor.
And there's a little park way up on a hill
where you can sit and watch the sunset. That's so romantic.
Uh-huh.
It's much nicer than that old Cerulean City, so let's get going!
-Okay. Let's go. -Really?
-To Cerulean City. - Ah. Unh!
I've got to get more trainer badges, Brock.
And since there's a Gym in Cerulean City
Yeah, makes sense to me.
Ah, I never wanted to wander back here. Oh.
-The coast is clear. -Nothing to fear.
Nobody here. Meowth.
Well, looks like we found it.
Just what we need to get just what we want.
Pokemon.
-So this is Cerulean City, eh, Brock? -Pretty nice place, isn't it?
Yeah, pretty cool. Hey, look. That's weird.
-Misty's not following us anymore. -Chu.
She really didn't want to come to Cerulean City, did she?
I wonder why she hates this place so much.
-Hmm. -Ah, we'll never figure out girls.
-The police. Wonder what happened. -Yeah.
Excuse me. Do you know what happened here?
Some burglars broke into that store last night.
Burglars, huh?
What do you know about burglars? -Huh?
You two look very suspicious to me.
Hey, you're that motorcycle officer from Viridian.
Huh? Ah, you must have met my sister-in-law.
If you know my sister-in-law,
that means you probably had some dealings with the police in Viridian.
Well, I...
Now, maybe you just stopped to ask her for directions,
or maybe you found a wallet on the street and turned it in to her,
or maybe you're a burglar who broke out of jail!
-I've never been to jail! -Neither have I, ma'am.
That's what they all say.
We just got into town and saw the crowd
so we came over to see what was going on.
The criminal always returns to the scene of the crime.
-We're not, uh... -Maybe this'll help clear things up.
I'm Dexter, A Pokedex program by professor Oak
for Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum.
Yeah and I was the Leader of the Pewter City Gym.
-Well, that's evidence enough for me. -I'm sorry I was suspicious.
Now I'm suspicious of my sister-in-law. She sure has weird taste in friends.
- Um, miss? - Hm?
I was wondering, since I'm new in town,
maybe we could get together tonight and you could show me around.
Well, I'm not off duty till past your bedtime
and I may even have to work round the clock to catch these burglars.
-Well, what exactly did they steal? -That's the strange thing about it.
They didn't take any money, just a massive vacuum and a giant hose.
But what would anybody want that stuff for?
I'm sure I don't know, young man,
but I do know I don't have time to play guessing games with you
because I've got a job to do, and it's time for you two to move along.
Come on, let's go.
All right, everybody. The show's over.
Nothing to see here. Break it up. Break it up.
Good thing I had Dexter and you had your badge.
Yeah. Shouldn't you head for Cerulean City Gym?
Yeah. Hey, Brock.
You got any inside info on the Gym Trainer there?
-Huh? -Ha-ha.
I just want to find out as much as I can about him
before we have our match.
Know yourself, know your adversary and you hold the key to victory.
You sure know some pretty deep stuff.
Heh, I learned that one from Dexter.
Well, I never actually met the trainer here but I know
his Pokemon special move.
Yeah? What is it?
I'm sorry, Ash, but I can't give you that information.
-Why not? -I'm a Gym Leader, too, after all.
I can't tell you out of respect.
-You understand. -That's cool.
Well, I have some stuff I need to check out.
-What stuff? -Just stuff. See you later.
-Bye. Well, let's get going, Pikachu. -Pika.
Cerulean City Gym. Cerulean City Gym.
Should be right around here someplace.
Huh? There it is.
the sensational Cerulean City synchronized swimming sisters!
Lily! Violet! Daisy!
But I thought this was the Pokemon Gym, Pikachu.
Pika.
I can't understand it.
Huh? It's like an aquarium. How can this be a Pokemon Gym?
- The crowd was totally awesome. - I know. That was so great.
-Daisy, the dive you did was super. -The practice really paid off.
Totally.
- Uh, excuse me. -I'm sorry
but if you want an interview, you have to, like, call our manager.
-No, it's not that. -We don't do autographs.
I don't want one.
I really just wanted to know if this is a Pokemon Gym.
It sure is.
- Well, I'm looking for the Gym Trainer. - You're looking at them.
Huh?
The three of us are the Gym Trainers here.
-We're The Sensational Sisters. -We're world famous.
Huh? But what's with all that swimming?
It's, like, our hobby, and our fans love to watch us perform.
We pool our talents to make a big splash.
Come on.
-I challenge all of you. -Pika.
-Um. -What?
We don't feel much like battling anymore.
-What do you mean? -We just got beaten three times in a row
by kids from this nowhere place called Pallet Town.
-Not again. -It was just one defeat after another.
My eyes were spinning from all the losses.
We had to, like, practically rush all our Pokemon
-to the Pokemon center. -This is the only one left.
Goldeen. Goldeen. Goldeen.
You mean all you have is a Goldeen?
If it would evolve into Seaking, we could use it.
But all it can do now is its horn attack.
So, like, there's no point in battling.
Now, Instead of having matches
we have time to make ourselves look more beautiful than ever.
-Ah. -I know what you want.
Seel?
Seel.
A cascade Badge. This is what you want, right?
-You can have it. -Thanks. Uh, I'd rather earn my badges.
Take it. A badge is a badge.
Here.
Hold it right there!
- Misty? -Cha!
Hi-yah!
All right, Daisy. If you don't want to battle him, I will.
If you don't want to battle him, I will.
What do you mean?
-I'm a Cerulean City trainer too. -
-I'm the fourth Sensational Sister. -There are only three Sensational Sisters
and one runt.
So, little sister, it's a surprise to see you back so soon.
That little girl with a big mouth who said she wouldn't come back
till she was a great Pokemon trainer. Wasn't that you?
Huh? I guess I did say something like that when I left.
So that's why Misty was so dead set against coming here.
Misty, you left here pretending you wanted to become a Pokemon trainer
because you couldn't compare with us.
Because we're obviously much more talented and beautiful than you are.
-Uh-oh. -That wasn't the reason!
Well, then, I guess, like, you came back
because you couldn't make it as a Pokemon trainer.
It wasn't my idea to come back here.
The only reason I'm here is because he wanted to come.
Well, he's totally not someone I'd choose for a boyfriend.
-Ah! -But you're no prize yourself.
My boyfriend? If I battle him, that'll prove I'm not a quitter
and I'm just as good a trainer as you three.
Well, you are the only one of us with a Pokemon that can actually battle.
All right, Ash. Are you ready to rumble?
Uh.
I wasn't planning on challenging you
till you paid me back for my bike, but this is as good a time as any.
If you want that cascade badge, you're going to have to beat me.
It'll be my pleasure.
Pikachu, this one's going to be a piece of cake.
-So how many Pokemon? -Two against two works for me.
You got it. All right, then, Pikachu, I choose you!
-Huh? -Chu.
-Pikachu, what are you doing? -Chu. Chu.
Uh, what? Are you saying you don't want to battle with Misty?
-Pikachu. -Well, I guess it's okay
If you don't want to battle a friend.
Pikachu, you're a Pika pal!
-Pikachu! -Thanks a lot, Pikachu.
Butterfree, I choose you!
Well, in that case, Misty calls Staryu!
- -Huh? Hmm.
Staryu, the core of this water Pokemon
shines in a rainbow of seven colors.
A core that is valued by some as a type of jewelry.
Oh. Wow.
Leave it to a girl to show off her jewelry.
Quit stalling and let's get this show on the road.
-Do you think Misty could really win? -Like, in her dreams, maybe.
Butterfree, you can blow that thing away with one blast. Tackle it!
-Staryu, counter attack! -Butterfree, dodge!
-Ha-ha! I'm going to win this. -Staryu, water gun.
In that case, Stun Spore now.
Oh, no. Staryu looks like it's in real pain.
It doesn't even have a face. How can you tell?
Because I'm sensitive to others' feelings, that's how.
-Oh, yeah? Like, I'm not? -Which side are you clapping for?
Staryu, wash it off.
Yay! Too bad you didn't know that Stun Spore doesn't work
if you wash it off in water.
She thinks she knows everything. Butterfree, Sleep Powder.
Tackle it from underwater.
If Staryu can get butterfree underwater, I win.
Water Pokemon always have the edge in the water.
Pikachu, you're supposed to be on my side.
Misty's totally awesome.
Well, we three got the good looks in the family
so I guess she had to get some talent.
Butterfree, return.
Pidgeotto, I choose you!
Oh, yeah? Staryu, return!
Misty calls Starmie!
Pidgeotto, Whirlwind it away!
Dive under, then up.
- -Strike back with wing attack.
- -Give it a gust to blow it away.
- -Starmie!
Oh, no. Starmie's energy is just about to run out.
All right, Pidgeotto. Let's get that trainer badge.
Huh?
-Check out that hair. -Like, who invited the party crashers?
Sorry to break in on you, ladies.
Allow us to introduce ourselves.
-To protect the world from devastation. -To unite all peoples within our nation.
-To denounce the evils of truth and love. -To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie. -James.
Team rocket. Blast off at the speed of light.
-Surrender now, or prepare to fight. -Meowth, that's right.
-The water Pokemon have the advantage. -But if we steal that water away.
-The Pokemon are ours for the taking. -And Meowth knows just how to do it.
What are they trying to prove?
A massive vacuum and a giant hose.
Ah! Team rocket were the robbers who broke into that store back there.
-I should have known it was them. -Our swimming pool.
-They're sucking it dry. -That's our water.
Right. I should give it back.
-We've got to protect the Pokemon. -Like, what about my hair?
All right, now's the time to suck them up.
Come back, Seel.
Oh, Pikachu.
Pikachu!
Hey, wait a second. Water conducts electricity.
-Pikachu, Thunderbolt! -Pikachu!
It's times like these that make me want to go straight.
Now I know how it feels to be all washed up.
We'll never come clean.
Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again!
-Oh, no. -Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Pikachu.
-Hey, we never got to finish our match. -Yeah.
-And I was just about to win it too. -What?
You could say your match had to be postponed, like, due to drain.
-At least nobody lost. -I wanted to win.
I guess I'm not going to get that Cascade Badge.
-Wrong. We're giving this badge to you. -Huh?
How come he gets the badge? He didn't win.
Pikachu was the one that, like, totally saved us all.
And if he'd used Pikachu from the start
there was no way your water Pokemon could have won.
-Oh, man. -Take the badge, Ash.
-You deserve it. -Gee, thanks.
-Heh, I'll take it! -Cha!
And so Ash earns his second Pokemon trainer badge.
Misty, you just go right on trying to be a Pokemon trainer.
You might as well be good at something'cause you'll never be stars like us.
You keep that up, and you'll be seeing stars.
-Chill out. -Misty, be careful.
-You know we love you. -Yeah.
-Ash. Hey, man. -Yo, Brocko.
-How'd it go? -See for yourself.
-Cool. Let's go. -Right.
You're not leaving without me.
Misty, you're not going be a sore loser, are you?
I didn't lose anything. It was a draw.
Well, I'm the one who got the badge.
What? You know you lost with Butterfree.
That was just round one. I made a great comeback.
If team rocket hadn't busted in, I would have destroyed you.
You're lucky they showed up. You were about to lose.
Lose? I was just getting started.
- Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah.
Oh, brother.
You guys up for the Pokerap?
There's 150 Pokemon. You got to name them all.
I'm doing 32 today, so try to keep up.
