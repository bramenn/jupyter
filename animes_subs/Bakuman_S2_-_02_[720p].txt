Dream of life
The fight doesn't end until I fulfill my dream
I wonder how far I've come now?
In ten years, I'll be living the dream
It's the scenario I wrote for myself, so I'll have no regrets
But life isn't that easy, and it's full of obstacles
Still, I swear to myself that I won't ever back down
I have a dream that I absolutely want to achieve
So I fuel my passion until I succeed
There will be meetings and partings along the way
But I'll simply believe in my strength that you've taught me
And rise back up again and again and again

In this world, every day is dull and full of nonsense
I cover my ears, trying to mute the noise
Why do people hurt each other?
In the contradictory, overlapping shadows
on the recesses of my heart, fallen into despair
While carrying this pain in my chest,
can I really dream of tomorrow?
can I really dream of tomorrow?

I've been asked to make a photo book. Is that ok? It seems they want to take some sketchy pics ()
I think it's your decision to make, not mine.

Window and
Snow
I'm home.
You were out late today.
Your dad is worried about you.
I'm sorry.
Dinner's all set.
Alright.
What's wrong, Miho?
Did something happen?
No, not really.
I see.
I'll go change.
You're going to waste a chance like that?
I apologize.
Even for popular voice actresses, opportunities for photo books don't pop up too often.
But doing that kind of work before I become popular as a voice actress...
You want to be more popular, don't you?
Think of this as a stepping stone towards that.
If you really want to be a voice actress, you can do that after you get as popular as an idol!
I don't want to do another thing like the Sacred Visual Girls School ending...
That was a huge success.
Even with your lousy singing voice, you've got such good offers coming in!
Listen, if you refuse an offer like this, it'll be very hard to make a living as a voice actress!
The world isn't that easy!
I'm sorry. Please let me think about it.
Jeez...
Today...
The atmosphere is heavy again.
You've been in a huff for two weeks!
It's painstaking work.
Yeah!
You've got to be on your best behavior.
I know, I know.
Well? Is that girl assistant cute?
Not as cute as you, so don't worry.
Are you saying that if she was, I would need to worry?
No!
I don't know if the atmosphere will change just because I invited Miyoshi over.
I need to do something...
But I've already tried turning on the radio and the TV.
Is there anything else I can do?
I'm coming in!
Good morning.
Good morning!
Um, this may be sudden, but this is my classmate and the person I'm going out with...
I'm Miyoshi Kaya.
Nice to meet you!
I'm Kato. Nice to meet you.
I'm Ogawa. Pleased to meet you.
And the one working in the middle is Takahama.
It's so nice to meet you!
Ogawa, sorry to interrupt, but she can do inking at least.
Feel free to give me work to do!
Well then, I can show you what needs to be done.
If you teach me, I can do anything you need!
Use me for other tasks, too!
It's like it just became more suffocating having another person in here.
Isn't it too quiet in here for six people?
That's my chief!
I know, right?
We have to, like, be more congenial!
Right, but I have no idea what to talk about.
Ogawa, do you have a girlfriend?
You have an adult appeal!
You're going to start out with a personal topic like that?!
I live with my girlfriend, and she's pregnant.
Living together, that's...!
Yeah. We're not getting married yet.
Wow, so adult!
Marriage...
That's why you have several jobs.
I have to pull in a decent income, you see.
When will the baby be born?
It's still a ways off.
Not sure...
I'm heading home.
Me too.
Good work today.
I'll be counting on you tomorrow!
Good job, you two.
You too, Miyoshi.
Sorry for calling you over so suddenly.
I had fun drawing manga.
I was surprised at Ogawa though.
That's why he's assisting other authors, too.
Others?
Yeah. Monday and Tuesday he assists the author of Shounen 3.
He's working hard since he's gonna be a daddy.
You're probably right.
You can go now too, Miyoshi.
There's nothing left to do.
Then show me your TV!
The one you won at the New Year's party!
We've got a meeting with our editor now.
Successful people sure are busy.
We're not successful yet.
I was surprised when he suddenly brought his girlfriend over.
Having another girl around was a bit relaxing.
Now that we've got more people, I can give you more time to work on your own project.
Ah, well...
I'm happy just being an assistant.
Don't say that. Just go for it.
Though I went to a technical school for manga,
ever since then, I've been told I have no talent for writing stories.
Really?
I can draw, but I can't write.
That's why I polished my skills as an assistant.
But I think it turned out well.
I can make a living.
I think you're great, Ogawa!
I can learn a lot from you.
Oh, really?
Yes!
Have you gotten used to your assistants?
Yes, somehow.
I see.
Then let's talk about your fourth chapter.
Yes!
Takagi, have you thought of a rival?
Well, I'm thinking of a detective who tries to arrest the protagonist, like Zenigata from Lupin III...
But that isn't very shounen-like.
Oh, really?
Just having a rival makes everything more exciting!
Then why wait till the fourth chapter?
We should introduce him earlier...
I'm not going to touch the chapters that Hattori approved and submitted to the serialization committee.
If you're kicked out by your 3rd chapter, it's his fault.
But you're going to start revising your story in the fourth chapter based on reviews of the previous ones.
So prepare two different storyboards.
If the first does well, go with that plotline.
If it doesn't, then change it to option two for the next chapter.
If it doesn't?
Miura, what's your honest opinion of chapter three?
Should I say it?
Yes!
I'll be blunt. Is that okay?
Please tell us.
If we're not brutally honest with each other, we can't call this a business meeting.
I think it's stiff.
Stiff?
But I also think it's the best one so far.
Which is it?
Well, how should I put this? Once you have a popular manga, you can play around with it a bit,
but at the beginning, everyone is desperate.
They don't have any room to relax.
I like a bit more fluff.
But since you're bringing the story to a conclusion in the first three chapters,
you had no space to play around with it.
So that's why chapter three is the best.
Well, there's not much to change.
Hattori's diligence shines through, and it's tightly done.
Perhaps too much so.
I'm still an underling, so I think the way he did it is correct.
But the manga changes slightly according to the preferences of the editor.
You're not being very clear.
So you think it can be popular?
So that serialization continues?
Since we're doing it, we have to think it'll be a hit!
If the people making it don't think it's good, it definitely won't be!
And there will be people who enjoy our work!
Take pride in that, and it'll encourage you to make the story even better!
He's not a bad guy.
I don't think so either, but...
He's taking TRAP seriously.
I'll make up two different storyboards for chapter four like he suggested.
Yeah.
No email again today?
Yeah.
I'll ask Miyoshi tomorrow.
Thanks.
You have until the end of the month to make a decision about the photo book.
Got it?
Miho?
Come to think of it, I haven't talked to her lately.
I see.
Okay, I'll call her tonight.
Alright, thanks.
I have to make myself useful as an author's assistant!
Anyways, I'm counting on you.
Okay! I'll take care of it!
What to do? Should I warn him?
Sensei!
Yes?
I have a question.
Sorry, did I make a mistake?
Well, it's about the effectiveness of this panel...
Oh, is it hard to understand?
It's hard to grasp the meaning of it.
How's it going, you two? The last train's departing soon.
I'm done with today's work.
How about you, Takahama?
Do you have some left?
Sorry, Kato, but can you split the rest with him?
What? Is that alright?
Then I'll be going.
Is it really okay?
Yeah.
At the rate he works, he can handle the rest of it no problem.
I'll get tomorrow's work ready!
Please do.
We'll be leaving, then.
Have a good evening!
Good work today!
Takahama, you can go too.
I'll take what's left and finish it at home.
No, I'll finish up today's work.
Then I'll stay here a bit longer, too.
I like Disney.
Huh?
I want to work at Disney.
Disney...?
Yes.
I think that if you aim to be a manga artist, you should dream big.
You're right.
I think so, too.
But why did you bring that up all of a sudden?
I respect you for your work ethic, working on a serialization while still in high school.
But those two who just left are no good.
They're satisfied just being assistants.
I just don't get it.
Ogawa's taken assisting to another level, and since he's skilled, I can understand.
But Kato's satisfied with herself just being an assistant.
There's no way we can understand each other.
That's why I want you to work hard, Sensei.
Oh, okay.
But you don't have to call me Sensei.
Then I'll call you Mashiro.
Tell the other two that.
You should tell them yourself!
Yeah.
What kind of manga do you like?
I like Ashita no Joe!
Joe? It's really cool.
A real man's manga.
Yeah!
Really? You talked with Takahama?
We had a lively conversation.
I didn't finish inking!
That's alright.
It's also important to communicate.
I'm headed to our office now.
I want to finish before they get there.
After I'm done with the classroom chores, I'll head right over.
Okay!
I forgot to ask about Azuki.
Even for me, it's too simple.
Send!
What's he doing?
Shh, he'll hear you.
Huh?
It's short!
But at least she responded.
Another?
What do I say?
I actually don't want her to do it, but I don't want to tell her that flat out.
Naked?!
What're you talking about, Azuki?!
Wait a minute, would Azuki even joke about wanting me to see her naked?
This isn't a joke!
Why doesn't she pick up?
And then Negishi suddenly started singing!
What's with that?
Negi's crazy.
I know, right?
And then
Huh?
Isn't that guy...
your boyfriend's friend?
Miyoshi! Can I talk to you for a minute?!
Could it be a confession?!
No way! He'd have to fight for her!
Did you tell Saiko Azuki's address?
Yeah, he looked pretty scary.
What the hell is he doing?
And what about Azuki?
Huh?
Don't give me that! You called her, right?
Miyoshi!
She said if she doesn't do this, she might not get any work as a voice actress.
She wasn't very happy.
Dammit.
Just what is going on?!
That's dangerous, Takagi!
Azuki's been suffering alone all this time!
Why didn't I realize it sooner?
She's been acting strange a lot, too!
You're abandoning the manuscript to go on a date?!
Shuuji...
It's our first serialized chapter!
You said If my dream comes true a million times!
Why now?
I'll draw when I get back.
Don't screw with me!
How long do you think it takes to get to Azuki's house?!
If you don't proceed with the manuscript. our assistants will have nothing to do!
She won't answer her phone.
Let me go!
Calm down!
What happened to her?
I'm going because I don't know what happened and I can't talk to her!
Hey!
Mashiro!
Miyoshi, call Azuki.
It's no good. I've been trying, but she won't pick up.
How about the house line?
I'll try it. But I think her mom will answer.
I'll do it.
Hello, this is Azuki.
Hi, this is Takagi, a classmate of Azuki's from middle school.
Oh, it's been a while.
Yes, it has.
Have you been well?
Uh, yes.
Actually, I have a favor to ask.
Miho?
I'm coming in.
Miho, you've got a call from Takagi.
If you don't want to talk, answer the phone and tell them yourself.
Hello, Takagi?
I'm putting Miho on.
Okay.
Azuki?
I think you're listening, so I'll talk.
Saiko is heading to your house.
He's ignoring the manuscript he has to draw.
Is that okay with you?!
If you're fine with that, then I misjudged you.
The door is closing. Please be careful.
Sorry!
Azuki, are you okay?
I'm sorry!
Go back and draw the manga!
Takagi called my house.
I'm sorry for causing trouble for everyone!
I thought I didn't want to show you what I'm like when I'm depressed,
so I didn't answer my phone.
But it's even worse for you to stop drawing manga because of me.
I won't have it!
So hurry back and draw!
But Azuki, you're worried about the photo book, right?
Yeah.
Then it's better for me to go and talk to you in person...
Mashiro, just tell me one thing.
What?
Regardless of how it'll affect my career as a voice actress,
would you be happy if I made a photo book?
Or not?
No!
I'd want to see your photo book, but I wouldn't want other people to see it!
I'd want it all for myself!
Thanks for telling me.
I won't do it.
I think I should be doing something different with my career.
Last night, I looked at our elementary school yearbook.
I looked at where I wrote my dream for the future a voice actress.
Your dream?
Yeah.
I knew there was a job called voice actress, and I genuinely wanted to become one.
I want to preserve that feeling.
I'm the same, I think.
When I was in elementary school, I admired manga authors, and I sketched a ton of manga in my school notebook.
But I gave up on it when I learned the harsh reality of it.
Reality?
Yeah.
There was a person who tried too hard making manga, and died.
Knowing how that world works, I realize that if I step into it, my ideals and reality might change and even be crushed.
But the road is the same for everyone.
And I think there are people who will realize their dreams without being crushed, no matter what obstacle is in their way.
You're right. I'll improve bit by bit.
Talking to you helped me sort out my feelings.
I feel better now, so don't worry and draw your manga.
Okay.
And from now on, lets talk about everything.
I'm sorry for being stubborn and acting tough, even while I was crying.
That's right. You're the one who said Lets try hard and encourage each other.
If we don't talk, I can't encourage you.
Yeah.
Mashiro, let's go to the beach one day.
We can take lots of pictures!
Sure, one day.
It's a promise for when our dreams come true.
I'll bring lunch.
Then that's a promise, too.
Our dreams keep increasing.
But just talking about dreams doesn't make them a reality.
Yeah.
You seem okay now, so I'm gonna hang up.
Thanks, Mashiro.
Talk to you later.
Okay.
Mashiro!
I'm sorry for interrupting your chance at a date, Saiko.
Sorry, Shuuji.
Just come back and pen-in the manuscript.
Miho making a photo book, huh.
Yeah, in the end, she refused.
Can she continue her voice actress work?
Yeah, she got another call to audition.
She sent me a email.
Me too.
And she asked me to properly apologize to Takagi.
You were really fearsome that day.
I said I'm sorry.
But it all went well after that.
Most importantly, TRAP safely began its first serialization.
Yeah, it's finally begun.
Now we just have to wait and see how it does in the polls.
Yeah, a first chapter of a new series should get first place.
It's Miura.
He'll have the early results, won't he?
Probably.
I'm answering it.
Yes, this is Takagi.
It's the start of TRAP's serialization.
I'm worried about the ranking
and other things, too...
I'll fix up any problems with my team!
Fukuda, let me call you boss!
Don't call me that!
Window and Snow.
Even if my body is freezing, my dreams won't cool down!
