It's like the report said...
The entire village is devastated,
and yet there's not a drop of blood, let alone any bodies here.
Then... the villagers of Ragako were able to safely evacuate?
If that's the case,
then the Titans were having a field day in a completely empty village.
That's hard to believe.
Furthermore... why would they evacuate without even taking a single horse?
Then what happened?
What could this mean?
Moblit, I found one! This way!
There you are...
Moblit, look at this.
This is a portrait of Conny Springer's parents?
It's a strong possibility.
Kill it!
Wait! Hold up!
Unbelievable...
Children
Will it be your petty life... or Christa's future?
It's up to you to decide.
Hey, say something! Who's the enemy?!
Ymir!
Who knows...
It's settled then.
Too bad, Eren.
You're kidding...
The Scouts... are already...
Dammit!
Reiner. What are you right now?
Relax, I'm a warrior.
You're saying to trust Ymir as a warrior?
Isn't she the one who ate Marcel?
Yeah, that's my point. Ymir's motive is clear.
Once she turned human again,
she probably roamed around and lived only caring about herself.
Until she met Christa...
And as cute as Christa is, we have other reasons to bring her to our side.
She's an important person in a family of the Church.
If Eren turns out not to be the Coordinate, our job isn't over yet.
Having Christa with us at that point will make our search much easier.
They're close.
What are they talking about?
Are they planning to leave before the sun sets?
Let's bring an end to it.
The next time we come here,
we can take Annie, Christa, and that back home.
That way we won't have to come here anymore.
Right. And our mission will be over.
But as for you...
When we get to our hometown, tell Annie how you feel.
Huh? Wh-What do you mean?
You stare too much.
Enough that everyone can tell.
But I-
You should go for it.
You're both murderers with short lives ahead.
Who better to understand what we've gone through than one of us?
What's going on, Reiner?
Aren't we waiting until night?
Nope. We're leaving now.
Eren, don't try to resist.
Come on, don't get violent with me.
Look at the shape that I'm in. Does it look like I can resist?
Please, gimme a break.
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
I'll kill you! I'll slaughter you!
-I'll kill you! -Hey. Why are we leaving already?
-Let go! -Ymir.
When you turned back into a human, do you remember the person you ate?
No, I don't remember...
But if it was five years ago...
Was it one of your comrades?
I see...
Sorry... for not even remembering.
It's not your fault for forgetting.
It was the same for us, too.
I see...
Eren doesn't seem to remember either.
Is that how it works?
Do you resent me for it?
I'm not sure... I... don't know.
You probably didn't want to eat a human either...
How long were you wandering outside the walls for?
About 60 years.
It was like... I was stuck in a nightmare that would never end.
A red smoke signal.
What?
Commander! We're surrounded!
There's a way around! Should we head towards it?
No... Any detours and we'll be too late.
We'll force our way through! All soldiers, prepare for battle!
For now, let's get to a place without Titans!
We need to get as far away as possible!
My Titan form isn't very fast.
If I get surrounded, I won't be able to protect you guys!
Then why didn't we just wait until nightfall?!
Smoke signals? Did the Scouts come to rescue us?
Unless they brought loads of horses over the wall,
that scouting formation won't work.
Someone made that call...
I didn't think it would happen so soon.
It must be Commander Erwin. A tough opponent!
Shit... They're already that close?
It's Eren's fault for going berserk.
It can't be...
She's...
No, she is!
Reiner! Christa's here! Christa came with them!
Huh?!
If you want her, now's the chance!
How do you know? You can't see her from here!
I just know it!
She's such a good-natured person, it's stupid!
I guarantee she came to save me! I know it!
Even if that's true, it's no use!
We'll do it later!
Huh?!
Our chance of succeeding is way too low!
How will you get Christa out of that formation?
Wait for a chance!
Wait for a chance?
Seriously? Will that be after I'm eaten by one of your warriors?
No! I don't trust you!
Trust me! Christa is indispensable to us, too!
Then get her now! Go prove it to me this instant!
It has to be now or never!
I want to see her right now!
At this rate... I'll never get a chance...
to see her again.
Information Available for Public Disclosure Ymir's Hometown
It is not known where Ymir's hometown is located. However, its location is most certainly outside the confines of the walls.
It's impossible.
I'm sorry, Ymir.
We don't even know if we can escape ourselves, let alone go back for her.
I promise you!
If anyone, it's Christa I want to save from this conflict!
You have to trust us! So just bear with it!
This is for Christa's own sake! Got it, Ymir?!
Is it... really for Christa's sake?
Yeah!
Fine...
Thank you.
It's happening again, Christa...
I've come this far...
Will I have to lie to myself again?
Hey... Here's a promising one.
How's this kid?
Yeah.
Hey, you there. You're going to come live with us from now on.
You'll be able to live a brand-new life now.
A brand-new life... needs a brand-new name.
Understand?
That day... was the first time I lied to myself.
From that point on, I convinced myself... that I never had a choice.
But...
It is this Lady Ymir who inherits the blood of the king.
As long as Lady Ymir is with us, we will be blessed with immortality.
Lady Ymir!
To be honest... it wasn't all that bad.
My food wasn't cold anymore...
And neither was my bed off the ground.
Lady Ymir.
But more than all... was the feeling of being needed by someone.
I served a purpose in someone's life for the first time ever.
To me, that was more precious than anything else.
But then, one day...
It's her! She's the one who did it!
She told us she has the blood of the king! All we did was believe her!
I was cruelly reminded that everything in my life...
Is that right?
N-N-
It's true.
I am Ymir! The blood of the king runs through me!
And once again... I told more lies.
If that's what it took to save everyone else...
However...
Things didn't work that way.
No!
Stop... Please, stop! I'm begging you!
That's when I knew...
This was my punishment.
It's not that I was being punished for deceiving all those people.
It was for convincing myself to believe... to feel needed by someone.
It's what I deserved for continuing to lie to myself.
This was my punishment.
It's a Titan! Run!
When I opened my eyes...
If there was such a thing as fate, I can only laugh at how fickle it can be.
And in that moment...
I was done with telling lies.
I wasn't going to lie to myself anymore.
From then on, I'd live honest to myself.
So? What ever happened with that?
She was given the name Christa Lenz and sent off to become a cadet.
What a pity. She would have been better off not being born.
Are you talking about me?!
Come on, now. It makes no difference to me.
And then...
Hey, you.
So you're trying to do something nice, huh?
Uh...
And then I met you.
I could tell right away......that you were the same as me...
That you fed yourself lies...
Give your hearts!
Yes, Sir!
That you were someone desperately trying to convince yourself...
But you know, Christa...
That's why... I won't ask you to understand.
Just that...
I'm sorry...
In this environment, I'm the strongest one here.
Q-Quit it, Ymir!
Don't you think a forest like this is where I can shine the most? Well?
Ymir! Stop! We'll fall!
Do you think I care?
If I became a Titan, I might be powerless compared to you,
but I can jump through the trees and move swiftly.
I could snatch Eren away from you and go back to meet up with the Scouts...
If you don't agree to take Christa with you right now,
I'll get in your way and fight you right here.
Wh-What are you saying?! Don't you care what happens to her?!
We can't help her that way!
Yeah, that's fine.
Even if it means taking her future away, I'll do what it takes to live and meet her.
I might be the shittiest person there ever was.
You guys don't know what it's like.
She knows how awful I am, and yet she still smiles at me... that girl.
You...
Don't be mad at me.
I have a plan for it.
If I stay and fight, it should be easier for you to escape anyways!
Or would you rather stay and kill each other?!
Do you want me to prove how crazy I am?!
A light?
Straight ahead in the forest! I saw a light!
It's the light that appears when a Titan transforms!
Then we're just in time.
Soldiers, disperse!
We believe the enemy has already transformed!
Locate Eren and recover him!
Another one of the Police!
Battle is not our objective!
Prioritize recovery and retreat!
Phil! Round up the horses!
Yes, Sir!
First thing is to find the enemy and let the others know!
They should be fleeing from the forest!
Break!
Eren.
Where are you?!
Is that the scream of a Titan?
It came from ahead!
You can't hide from me!
Wait!
This is Ymir!
She's the one they took! In Titan form!
Hey, Ymir! Why are you the only one here?!
Where's Eren?! What about Reiner!? Bertholdt?!
So that's Ymir?
Did she turn into a Titan and fight with Reiner?!
Ymir?
Did you get away from Reiner?! Where are they?!
Tell us anything, Ymir!
Say something already!
Hey, ugly! We're in a hurry!
Is she keeping an eye out for Reiner?
Something's not right.
Why... is she looking at everybody one by one?
Ymir!
Thank goodness!
You're all right!
Huh?
No...
She...
She ate Christa!
Don't just stand there! Chase her!
She's fast! We're losing her!
Why would Ymir do that?!
I can't be the only one who could've guessed it would turn out this way!
Yeah! She's clearly hostile to us now!
Looks like she's cooperating with Reiner! She lured us right in!
Here she comes, Reiner.
Right.
Oh no...
Eren's being taken away!
Don't stop!
Get on your horse and chase!
I'm getting him back no matter what!
Even if it means trading my life for it!
The battle of pursuit begins.
The hunters and the hunted.
The intense emotions of friends made foe... spill and clash on the battlefield.
But soldiers are falling far too quickly.
In a gamble waging the fate of humanity, Erwin executes a do-or-die strategy.
Charge
Charge.
