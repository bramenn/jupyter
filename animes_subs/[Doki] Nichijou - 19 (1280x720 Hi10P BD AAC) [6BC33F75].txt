Hey!
( !)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
All right! I'll say it!
You are my best, best friend!
(Fly!) When I joke around a bit,
(Shine!) You joke around more in response.
(La La La) Nothing is better than this!
(Why!) Even if something bad happens,
(Fine!) I immediately forget about it!
(La La La)
Always keep it going!
Being together 24 hours a day isn't a problem.
Just like twins, or a parent and child, or clone cyborgs.
Then isn't there no reason to clear your eyes?
Those are completely, completely different issues.
(Fight!) Even when I get in a fight with you,
(Down!) even when I get really down,
(Shy!) even when I feel like I want to be alone,
before I realise it, you're right there; we'll be together even in death!
I wonder why it is.
I want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
time goes 100 times faster!
It's fun, isn't it?
It's way too fun!
As expected of my best friend!
What is it?
The synchro is amazing!
Always making an uproar,
bothering the neighbours a lot.
What time is it now?
And then yo de le hi hoo!
I don't get it at all!
So re doh si la!
It's better than I imagined, the absolute best!
Even if I say this and that, we're still friends. (Hooray!)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
Cha Cha La Cha La Cha Cha!
Even if the names of the stars scattered
within the fierce winds
and are completely forgotten
and not remembered by anyone,
Headlight, Taillight. The journey isn't over yet.
Headlight, Taillight. The journey isn't over yet.
Your footsteps vanish into time
along with the falling rain.
Even if songs of praise
are no longer for heroes,
Headlight, Taillight. The journey isn't over yet.
Headlight, Taillight. The journey isn't over yet.
Headlight, Taillight. The journey isn't over yet.
Headlight, Taillight. The journey isn't over yet.
A wild horse
A wild horse
Why does he run around?
With his head raised
and his tail fluttering
his muscles throbbing in his chest
Endlessly
Endlessly
Running around
In a summer storm
Toward the thunder
Toward the thunder
oh- oh oh- oh
oh-oh oh-oh
A wild horse
Running around endlessly
Endlessly

I will now do something that has never been done before and will never be done again.
Domestic Violence.
What did you think?
Even if you ask us that...
That was very like you, Fecchan.
That was definitely very like you, Fecchan.
Yeah, that was very like you, Fecchan.
Next I'm going to try something that's not like me.
I fell!
That was very like Fecchan.
Oh.
That's definitely very like Fecchan.
Hey! We've got daihuku! How about one?
I'm sorry, but can you wear this instead?
Hey!
We've got daihuku!
How about one?
I'm sorry, but...
Could you possibly put on some clothes?
Are you mad at me?!
You aren't mad at me?
What is it, then?
Hey...
It's all right if you talk right now!
Here I go!
Yes!
You didn't jump it!
But the bar is -
To be more precise, you didn't go over it!
Just what should I do for you to properly learn how to jump?
The sun's going down!
I'm sorry.
I'll try harder next time.
I'm going to lower the bar this time,
so just take it slow and jump as I taught you.
I got it.
Anyway, I need to get better before the next examination.
I need to be able to jump, even if it's just a bit.
Or else everyone...
How was it?!
You stupid pumpkin!
Why don't you jump with the form I taught you?!
Are you messing with me?!
Well, in my head, it's an elegant backward jump...
An elegant backward jump?
Your form is more like...
A human... torpedo.
I didn't say that!
Wait...
I did say that...
No way! You're joking, right?
You don't even realise it?!
Sorry.
Well, I'll stick around until you can do it, Mio-chan.
You always let me copy your homework.
It's my turn today!
Let's keep going until you get it!
Anyway, just take it slow!
First, try to jump like you're just stepping over it.
Mio-chan, just calm down.
It's all right!
This isn't the first time I've been bad at sports.
Hey, Mio-chan.
This is soccer!
My physical strength is about average.
But when rules are thrown in, I forget what I'm doing.
Fall!
On your mark...
Start!
Mio-chan, falling is the other way around!
But if I don't do anything about it, nothing will change!
I'll just stay the same!
Here we go.
Mio-chan, we're not trying to be propellers!
We're doing somersaults!
I don't care if the effort is wasted.
I don't care if there are no results!
However, there is one thing!
There's one thing that I can do for myself!
One, two, three!
Let's try once more.
I'm doing it for Yukko.
I'm going to rest for a while.
Oh, all right.
And I'm doing it for myself!
I won't give up!
If I'm going to give up,
I'll give up after I do everything I can!
Effort will always open up a door.
It later became known as the Torpedo Jump.
White tigers are like this!
They're kinda...
That one even has its butt pointed at us.
I guess.
Also, they're pretty far away, so we can't see them well.
We came all the way to see this, but it's so boring!
At least we got to see them.
I guess so.
Yay!
It's raining!
I need to bring in the laundry!
Hey, where are you going?
It's too late.
Just bring it in!
It's raining!
Professor, Sakamoto-san, I'm home!
It's raining pretty hard outside.
Did you bring in the laundry?
It's because Sakamoto told me to bring it in!
It's the truth.
It's really because Sakamoto said that.
Sakamoto-san said to bring it in, so it fell to the ground?
That's not it.
Sakamoto said to bring it in,
and then he said to drop it.
I didn't say that!
Geez, that startled me.
What are you saying all of a sudden?!
It's because you said that.
I never told you to drop it.
You did.
I didn't.
You did.
I didn't.
You did!
I didn't!
You did!
I didn't!
You did!
I didn't!
Just leave me alone!
Nano.
I'll go sacrifice Sakamoto.
Is that okay?
What do you mean?
It's all right.
If you wash the dirt, the clothes will come back to being clean.
That's right.
That's right!
However, today won't come back.
Neither of you are getting any dinner tonight.
Why am I always the victim?
But it was Sakamoto who did it!
Which is why I'll go sacrifice him. Is that okay?
All right.
I'll take Sakamoto-san,
and only you won't get dinner.
Wait, no!
I'll be the sacrifice!
I was the one who dropped them,
and I was the one who got them all wet!
Tonight's dinner is omelette rice!
Eggs were on sale!
Wait, I can eat tonight?
Oh right, I completely forgot!
Um, well...
I'll just let you eat today.
Yay!
You won't get anything tomorrow, though!
Swim, swim.
Sharky, sharky, chomp!
Sharky, sharky, chomp!
If that happens, do this!
Mio-chan, Mai-chan!
Selamat pagi!
Wasn't it a pain to make a self portrait out of clay?
Oh, that was due today?
What's this?
Did Mio-sensei forget to do her homework?
I totally thought it was due tomorrow.
Mai-chan, did you do it?
Crap.
Mai-chan, you, too?
Maybe it'll start raining today.
Not just a bit of rain,
it's going to be a deluge.
A deluge.
It actually...
Y-You guys...
What are you doing to my temple?!
You donation thieves!
T-That was close!
You're cursed...
Plague bringers!
Get out...
Get out of my temple!
Just go with it...
Please, President!
I'm going to have a match against Takasaki-sensei.
Could you be the referee?
Referee? For Go Soccer?
That's correct.
If I win this match, he'll have no choice but to become our advisor.
I'm going to win this!
Don't worry.
If you take a look at that, you'll be fine.
It might be my fault for not reading the book,
but I have no clue what these two are doing!
Is this really Go Soccer?!
Even if you had read it, you wouldn't understand.
Ogi!
Because they both started off with prohibited techniques,
they're in a high-level stand-off that ignores reason.
For example, that arm raised straight up.
If you consider that a leg on a Go board,
then the opposition's stance is like the Go stones.
It's like they're in perfect unison.
The way he's holding the ball is deceptive.
Based on my judgement, these two are...
I have no clue what he's saying!
They started moving!
Oh no!
Be loved!
Ogi, what is that supposed -
Be quiet.
Don't you get it?
The grave atmosphere around them.
If they make a single mistake,
someone could die.
What in the world is going on?
It's been a while since I've seen such a high-level battle!
Of course, the wind is rustling.
Oh no!
That stance!
Could he be planning to do that in a field match?!
Is he insane?!
But I can't just stand by and watch in this situation.
Father, I am going to use it.
It's all for the sake of justice!
Shine a light...
Ogi forbidden style.
Super Ogi!
Ogi Star!
This is it!
Oh, Final Loved!
Nice going!
You too!
Good heavens.
I started this club just to play around.
This is...
Get down when nobody's looking.
No matter how much I get stepped on, like a phoenix, I shall come back.
That's me: Clay!
Scramble here!
Today, I'll be changing into many different forms in order to fight with the kids!
Next time on Nichijou: Episode 20.
Very well, then! Kids, come at me!
