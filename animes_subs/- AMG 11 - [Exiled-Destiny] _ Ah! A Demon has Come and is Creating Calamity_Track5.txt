Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
Who are you?
Who am I?
I come bearing your doom!
That sure was an ominous dream...
This pulse...
It can't be...
Ah! The Demon Arrives and Wreaks Havoc?!
What's the matter?
Nothing...what about you, Keiichi? Didn't you get enough sleep?
Oh, well, I had a bad dream.
Aha! I bet you dreamed that you got dumped by Belldandy, am I right?
I did not!
Please, Urd!
Now that's what I call a good luster...
Ah! You have a skilled eye.
That one just came in yesterday... it's an import.
What's this?
A DEMON! A DEMON! YOU WILL BECOME A DEMON!
What's up? Did you spot a great bargain or something?
What is this...
What's going on, Den-chan?
A CD? What the heck are we gonna do with a CD...
It's good...
Yes. It's good...
We'll take this.
I don't remember stocking anything like that...
Huh? What's up with this? Why would I have something like this?
Didn't you want to listen to it?
But... we don't have a CD player, anyway.
Well, maybe we should start by coloring it black, just like a record?
Hey, good idea.
Where does the needle go?
Are you sure it's okay to spin it at 45 RPM?
What the hell?
Damn those gods...putting extra protection on the seal!
And who would stick a CD on a freakin' record player, anyway?
What kind of a place is this?
Who the hell are you?
You want to know?
I am Marller, Demon First Class, Unlimited!
And since you did release me from that claustrophobic CD...
Spit it out, now!
Hey! What's the big idea?
How dare you intrude upon our sanctuary without removing your shoes!
Just get the hell out of here!
Is that all you're going to ask me for? I can't believe your lack of greed!
Your wish is granted!
Disappeared!
I wonder what that was all about.
It was probably a newbie from the shop, trying to drum up sales.
What should we do with this?
Good question...
Damn, I left it behind...
But the thing is...
I don't ever want to set foot in a place like that again.
No, right now my priority is to settle that old score!
Just you wait, goddesses!
I'll get my revenge if it's the last thing I do!
Gotcha!
You wish!
KO
She beat me again!
Isn't there anyone better out there?
Okay, then I'm next! No, let me take her on!
Just get in line. You'll all get your chance with me, so bring it on!
Right?
Belldandy?
What's wrong?
Keiichi! Let's go home right now!
Huh?
Disaster is headed for us... I can feel it!
Urd?
You're history!
Really!
What's the matter?
O Blue Stone that wards off evil and repulses demons...
I beseech you, protect us with your white robe.
Barrier shield!
You'll be safe now.
Will you tell me what's going on here?
Earlier, I felt a certain pulse...
I believe a demon will be coming...
A demon?
Yes.
We goddesses serve the Almighty and wish for the happiness of all humans...
So one of those is coming?
Not only that, but I remember this particular pulse...
With Urd's help, I sealed a demon on the Almighty's orders...
Excuse me! Registered mail!
Oh...I'll go answer that, all right?
Uh...
Keiichi, you mustn't leave the barrier field.
Demons, huh?
Sounds like it's a lot more than just plain hostility...
Right on the money!
Belldandy and I have a complex relationship...
Who are you to talk to me like that, you tanuki!
So you've forgotten my voice, have you?
You're from my... you were in my dream!
That's right. I am Marller, Demon First Class, Unlimited.
Don't you ever forget it, either.
Excuse me!
Sorry to keep you waiting...
Hmm?
Registered mail... I need you to sign for it, please.
But this is a demon's messenger!
I see Belldandy's as gullible as ever.
Now then, what am I going to do with you?
What did I ever do to upset you?
Look, you... do you have any idea of the trouble you're causing?
What?
Normally, it wouldn't be possible to bind a goddess to Earth.
And you've got two of them!
In Urd's case, it's not that I asked her to...
Shut up! Stop making excuses!
When goddesses loiter around on Earth, the absolute quantity of joy swells.
If that happens, I'll lose my job!
There's way too much happiness concentrated around you.
To put it bluntly, you're an eyesore!
Therefore, you'll have to pay for this with your body.
But how is that fair?
If something were to happen to you...
Cut it out! You demon! You devil!
That's exactly right. I am a devil!
Now I'll be free to focus on my job without any distractions!
Marller!
You let your guard down because of that barrier field, huh, Belldandy?
But how...
I snuck inside before you threw up the barrier.
Thanks to you, I was able to accomplish my job safely inside it.
What have you done to Keiichi?
You haven't figured that out? He's right here.
Keiichi! How could you?
Please forgive me! My powers came up short...
No, not that. Over here!
You will change Keiichi back at once! I'm ordering you as a first-class goddess!
I'm afraid I can't oblige you.
After all, it's our job as demons to get in the way of you goddesses.
Be gentle when you ride him, all right?
Come back here! Wait!
Marller?
I'm home... I just saw Marller back there...
Urd!
Keiichi?
So that's the story...
Well, that Marller always had an evil nature, remember?
Of course, that's probably why she's a devil!
Anyway, you sure got your butt kicked.
But hey, being a bike once in a while isn't so bad. You love bikes, don't you?
Urd!
Oh... hey, my bad.
Even so, it would be inconvenient for him to stay this way, wouldn't it?
Don't worry, I promise I'll change you back to your original form.
Looks like it's time for me to show my stuff!
Now then, drink this and you'll be rid of any curse under the sun!
Urd-Ade Super-Z!
But how can we get him to drink that?
Through here!
Now, drink up if you know what's good for you...
Keiichi! You must calm down!
Oh dear...
Looks like it only works on humans...
Let me give it a try this time.
Guide this man back to his original form...
To break a devil's curse, I guess we're going to need the password.
But if we can keep chipping away at it like this...
There!
Isn't it getting worse?
No, no, not at all...Take that!
I don't think it'll do any good to give him an extra wheel.
No way out of it...Take that!
Sorry about that.
Never mind... one way or another, we're going to have to get...
Our only hope is to get Marller to break the curse and turn him back herself.
But do you really think that demon's going to just do as we ask?
Do you suppose Marller's angry at us for sealing her?
Oh come on, we did that because she broke the rules!
Still, Marller's the type who never forgets a grudge.
But how do you suppose the seal was breached?
Wait a minute! That's it!
The catalyst the Almighty used to seal Marller...
I'll bet it's around here somewhere!
If we can just get our hands on it, then she'll have no choice but to do as we say.
Keiichi!
The Eye of Heaven, the Eye of the Earth... and the Eye of Water...
Reveal to us the location of the demon's catalyst.
What the heck is this?
Huh? Keiichi, you know what this means?
All right, then, let's split up and look for it.
I'm going after the catalyst. Belldandy, you try to hunt down Marller.
All right.
We'll return you to your original form... we promise, Keiichi!
Okay, you're coming with me.
Excuse me, but I'm looking for someone.
A person dressed like this...
Thank you very much!
Put on a Helmet. Save a Life.
You're telling me to put this on, is that it?
All right, all right, I heard you the first time!
I can feel it...
What's that?
Over there?
I get it!
Women are not allowed to enter this dorm! How many times do we...
Oh, don't be such a stiff!
Listen, guys, did you happen to buy a strange-looking CD?
A CD...you think she's talking about that one?
Oh, that thing?
We unloaded that CD on a second-hand store ages ago!
Which store was that?
You'd better tell me, or I'll give you the punishment of your life.
The used-record store over on Third Street!
Oh? Really?
Thanks, boys!
What the hell was that about?
We'd better add a new dorm rule...'no riding bikes indoors.'
I'll borrow some of that stuff over there, all right?
Hey, let me have some, too!
No way! It's your own fault for dropping yours, Junpei!
But you made me drop it, Hijiri!
I didn't!
I wish you'd just drop yours too, Hijiri!
Huh?
I'd be happy to grant you that wish.
Well? Human misery is a joy to behold, is it not?
You feel the same way I'm feeling, aren't you?
Ouch!
I do you a favor by granting your wish, and that's the thanks I get?
Unbelievable...
This pulse...
It's Belldandy!
Found it!
This is all we need to...
Ma'am...
What?
Your money!
Keiichi, we need money.
Marller, please turn Keiichi back to his original form.
You actually think I'm just going to submit to your orders?
Surely not the orders of a goddess who sealed me in such a horrible catalyst!
About that...
Why would someone like a goddess attach herself to a lowly human?
Because I have a contract with Keiichi!
You can terminate a contract with a human any time!
That's not true! Because I'm staying here out of my own free will!
In that case, I have no choice but to carry out my own duty!
I understand your feelings for Keiichi.
Basically, it's Keiichi's very existence that's binding you to Earth.
So why don't I just erase Keiichi completely?
If that happens, then you'll...
Marller, don't you dare go any further.
Oh? Then do you want to fight?
Wow, look at the special effects!
It's just like a movie! Wow, look at the special effects!
Get a move on, now, Keiichi! Power up!
What's the matter?
Is that the best you can do as a goddess?
Don't tell me you're weaker now than you were before?
I get it, so that's what's stopping you from releasing your true power!
It must be inconvenient to be a goddess!
Please! Just do as I say and turn Keiichi back! Or else I'll...
You still have the nerve to talk like that?
I'm sure you've reached your limit by now.
If you break your contract and go back to Heaven, I might forgive you!
I'll never do such a thing!
Marller, catch!
Urd!
As I recall, you've always been vulnerable to good-luck charms, haven't you?
Here, we found it.
But that's the Almighty's CD!
That's right. The Almighty's catalyst... paired with the Demon's catalyst.
It's what we use to seal away demons who have sinned!
Marller!
Wait a minute! Stop! Please, don't do this to me again!
Then please give us the password that will return Keiichi to his original form!
Why? What makes you care about him so much? He's nothing but a human!
Because Keiichi is... because Keiichi is...
All right, I'll give it to you.
I'll give you the damned password, so back off!
Guide this man back to his original form... Ado Solia Helestia.
I'm sorry, I'll get you some clothes!
Sorry, Belldandy! I'm sorry, I'll get you some clothes!
Is this all right?
You saved me! Is this all right?
Dammit...
Unless I get that catalyst back, I don't stand a chance against them!
I've got to do something...
Really, now! I've got to do something...
It's all Belldandy's fault.
Hey, are you listening? Isn't this outrageous?
How can I be second-best?
I'd rather sell my soul to the devil than come off second-best to that girl!
Did she say Belldandy?
One day when I woke up...
A day like any other... another one just beginning.
There you are, yawning... your face is still so sleepy.
Because each peaceful day we share is a miracle to me.
This is where my heart will always return...
Forever...
There's only one thing I wish for.
I chase after the same dream, wherever it may go.
The love I feel for you gives me strength.
May tomorrow be as joyful as today...
That's my wish...
The queen's slumber is rudely disturbed by a demon's snore.
When these two meet in bed, it creates a rift between the man and his goddess.
Next episode: Ah! Choosing Between the Goddess and the Queen?
No, it's you I want by my side forever!
