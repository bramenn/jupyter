We've come to this island to execute a certain mission.
Y-Yes... It is to capture the legendary Black Wizard, Zeref.
And something else... I forget.
And, um... Why am I on my own?
Where did everyone go?
As is Fairy Tail tradition, I shall count to three before rendering judgment upon you.
The super magic which affects only those whom the caster views as enemies...
One!
Fairy Law, is it?
Two!
Three!
That's it!
Fairy Law!
Stop that.
Grimoire Law.
T-T-That's...
It can't be...!
It has been a while, boy.
Master... Purehito...
God damn those Magic Council bastards!
They are so damn annoying!
Calm down!
Calm down?! Do I look like I wanna calm down to you, huh?!
Yeah, but...
Let it be, boy.
Oh? You back, Master?
It seems like you have caused quite a mess during your last job, again.
These wannabe wizard thieves were talking crap about our guild.
Your feelings toward the guild are true.
But violence begets naught but more violence.
I don't get you at all.
A spirit of peace.
Caring for one another, in harmony.
Humans were once a single being, and such is true for magic.
Spirit o' peace, huh?
Perhaps you are still too young to grasp this subject, boy.
And hey! Stop callin' me boy!
Master... Purehito...
Why? Why you?
Lost Magic!
Why did you form a Dark Guild?
Are not both sides of the same coin, Makarov?
This world is filled with things that cannot be measured as good or evil.
Be you good or evil, the spirit of Fairy Tail shall never waver.
This boy has learned his way with words, he has!
Enough with the boy.
You are no longer a member of the guild.
But I do not wish to fight you.
Will you leave now, at once?
My heart aches as well, if only a smidgen...
I will not let you harm the guild!
You dare defy me, boy?
Sweep away darkness, rain of light!
How crude, Makarov!
Devour the light, shadow of eternal darkness!
In that case...
The 28th form of Amaterasu's magic circle, in an instant?!
You cannot beat me.
Magic dances to my will, freely, without restriction!
W-What is this?
Grand Defense Magic Circle!
Three Divine Pillars!
Amaterasu's 100th formation.
Did you hear that, Happy?
Yeah! Sounded like an explosion!
They think they can go nuts in someone's backyard, huh?
There are so many of them... What in the world are they after?
Who cares? Let's bust'em up!
All of you Grimey Warts!
I-It's Grimoire Heart...
Don't go correcting every little thing.
Mest-san mentioned Zeref before, so...
Could Grimoire Heart be after...
Zeref...
Stop messin' with me!
Wind Edge!
Cana is really in a fighting mood...
Not only did they break up the exam, they're trampling on our sacred ground!
We ain't gonna let them off easy!
Cana, control your anger!
S-Sorry... Thanks for that.
Man, there's no end to'em.
It's just one right after another!
But they aren't very tough.
All they have to their advantage is numbers.
Crap...
Either way, this isn't going to end well for us.
If we continue fighting like this, we'll run out of magic power, not to mention stamina!
Then I should summon Taurus or Sagittarius...
Wait, Lucy!
You should conserve your magic power.
If you chumps wanna pick a fight with Fairy Tail, bring on someone a little tougher!
Water Lock!
Blazes!
How are we to search for Wendy like this?
Erza-san, what in the world was that explosion before?
Juvia sensed an incredible magic power...
Right now we must concentrate on the enemy in front of us.
Right.
What if Gray-sama is also surrounded by the enemy?
Juvia wants to go to Gray-sama's side soon!
I told you to concentrate!
I'm sorry!
Dream Knock!
Take Over!
Are you okay, Lisanna?
Yeah... These guys are dropping down all over the island.
We're gonna defend this place to the last, until everyone shows up!
Understood!
Man!
Now, Evergreen!
I'm pretty sure...
What's this?
I can't move!
Don't look into her eyes!
We're... turning to stone...
That worked well, but that kind of dirty trick isn't a very Manly way to fight.
Don't call it a dirty trick!
The wars won't end.
Nothing changes.
Can people... Can society continue on living without persisting in this endless war?
The pulse of battle on the island, growing stronger...
Why can't it be stopped?
Why?
I see now I was right in having high hopes for you.
And you supported the guild well for 48 years.
Are you not feeling well, Makarov?
We have both aged, yes...
The point of congruence between two people who walked different paths...
Is today the day in which the world's continuum is completed?
You were a fine master.
You taught me peace.
You led me down the right path.
Whatever has happened to you?!
Magic was once born from within darkness.
The power was suppressed. It was feared.
Eventually it became a part of daily life,
and the time came when it was considered a part of culture.
But, in my search for the root of magic, as I came to Zeref, I saw it...
That which is the essence of magic!
Sleep.
Fairy Tail's story ends here.
It... isn't over.
Hear me... my successor.
What is this disturbance in my heart?
Over here, over here!
You damn cat!
Annoying little...
You're gonna get me...
Lily!
Come on, don't overdo it!
Damn it! I don't even have enough magic power to support my battle form!
There's nothing we can do.
Wendy can't recover lost magic power.
So I have to wait for it to recover naturally?
Even in such a desperate situation...
Mest-san's disappeared.
Just ignore that guy.
Miss, you can't heal your own wounds?
Of course she can't.
Oh, so that's how it is.
Everyone, hide!
B-But...
Leave these guys to me and Natsu!
Understood.
I hate to say this, but we're counting on you, Happy.
Carla...
It pains me, but we'd just hold everyone back as we are now.
I'm glad you understand!
Everyone sit back and eat a fish, cause this'll be a piece of steak!
Steak can be pretty tough, you know.
Please don't encourage him... It'll wear on you.
What, that all you got?
Who's next?
I'm super pissed'cause some guy turned my precious scarf all black!
I need to punch people more!
What?
Why are you takin' it out on us?
What a cruel...
Then why don't I turn the rest of you to black ashes?!
Fire Barret!
This is what I've been waiting for!
You did it!
Eat that, jerk!
The Fire Barret is hot enough to melt stone.
No matter what kind of Fire Wizard you are, it won't be so easy for you to...
Wha?!
What is he?
He's eating the fire!
I can't believe it!
D-Don't tell me... He's the one I've heard about...
Now that I've eaten, I'm all revved up!
Dragon Slayer... Natsu the Salamander!
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
He's crazy!
W-What'll we do?
Our magic power can't compete with this monster!
Who're you callin' a monster?
That's enough.
I'm tellin' you to quit it.
Zancrow-sama!
He ain't someone you guys can handle.
You all, go search for Zeref.
I can handle him myself, no problem!
Zeref?
As we feared... Grimoire Heart is after...
Things are getting really complicated.
Then, Zancrow-sama, we'll just be...
Thanks a bunch!
That guy's crazy strong.
He's that Salamander we've heard rumors about!
Hold it, you!
You just said strong, didja?
Yeah?
Uh, um...
Just a slip of the tongue...
Sorry...
There ain't no guild stronger than Grimoire Heart in this world, got it?
Flames?
Our guild is the strongest guild!
What is that?
Black flames...
Grimoire Heart doesn't need weaklings!
What is he doing?
Why, you...
You... To your own comrades!
My comrades?
I don't wanna hear some two-bit, weak litte guild lecture me!
To hell with you!
Flames ain't gonna work on me!
Natsu-san, don't!
I have a bad feeling about those flames!
I can't eat them!
What's with these flames?
Get off your high horse, puny dragon hunter!
Natsu!
It's flames that the Flame Dragon Slayer can't eat?!
You gonna eat the flames of a god, even more powerful than a dragon's?
Blasphemy!
Flames of a god?
It's different than your magic, see.
You're talking to a God Slayer!
God Slayer?
Damn it... This is really tiring.
But we've almost cleaned'em out.
Right. Let's take down the rest all at once!
R-Right...
But these guys are probably attacking everyone else, too...
What? Against these guys, everyone'll be fine.
Wait!
I sense...
The enemy disappeared!
Falling down from the sky, disappearin'... These guys get around.
Be careful.
Up there!
They cannot beat you.
This is a waste of time.
Your opponent will be meh.
A goat?!
A goat... I think.
What's wrong?
It's... He's different than the grunts we've been fighting.
Anyway, suck it up for round two!
We managed to slip away.
Let's hurry forward.
Right!
Who goes there?
Encounter enemy during mission.
Eliminate immediately.
Switch highest priority to extermination.
Begin battle.
A child?
Don't be fooled.
I can sense a queer magic power.
What the hell is he?
Can't you tell? He's an enemy.
In the lonely forest, devils and fairies have a fateful encounter...
Huh?
Some kind of spell?
Yes!
This is our battle frontier!
What's with this guy?
Can't you tell? He's an idiot.
Over there! Who are you?
My, my...
First we have children and cats, and now women?
Lisanna, stand back. This guy's dangerous.
I can fight too, damn it!
W-Why? Why is no one here?
And it's hot!
And I'm thirsty!
Zeref...
Wait for me.
Makarov's brats have no chance of defeating the Seven Kin of Purgatory.
They are superb wizards I have nurtured for years!
Each one of them uses a wizardry closest to the true source of magic...
They are Lost Magic users!
Before this forbidden magic, they'll be powerless.
I said bring it!
I'll devour your dragon flames!
You bastard! You're on!
I'm all fired up!
It's hot...
I'm hungry...
Where's Lord Zeref?
I'm thirsty...
That guy can use flames, too?
He called himself a God Slayer, but...
What does he mean by a god ( kami ), anyway?
You see'em a lot in rivers and the ocean.
That's crabs ( kani ).
Then, it's the things Lucy uses?
Those are keys ( kagi ).
When it's summer, it grows a lot on bread-
That's mold ( kabi )!
Next time: Fire Dragon vs. Flame God.
Come on, let me finish.
Natsu, you were actually just joking around with me?
Ya got me!
