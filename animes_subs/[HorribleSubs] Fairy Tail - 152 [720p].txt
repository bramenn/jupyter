Thank you, Lucy-san!
I can't hold a candle to Cancer, but I'm pretty good if I do say so myself!
Yes, you're really good!
And it feels great doing this outdoors, doesn't it?
Not to mention unusually quiet!
It actually feels kind of peaceful.
Although with this guild, you know the peace isn't going to last long...
You're probably right.
Hey!
See?
This peace didn't last long at all...
Hey, Happy!
Fish?!
Oh, just Natsu...
Don't give me just Natsu!
What are you mad about?
At any rate, dream or not, all those fish were there for the taking...
I was shocked...
Hey!
What is it you want?!
You're my partner, aren't you?!
Yes, that's right.
And right now, I'm cleaning the backyard.
Like this...
Well, sure. It's your turn!
If it's my turn, why isn't my partner helpin' me?!
It doesn't make sense, right?!
It makes plenty sense!
How incredibly trivial...
No, it doesn't!
No different than usual, though...
That's different than this.
After all, it's not my turn today.
Happy, when did you turn so cold?!
I'm not cold!
Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?
The sun is pleasantly warm...
Why are you two arguing over nonsense?
At least clean up without bitching about it!
What's that, Gray?!
I never said I had a beef with cleaning! Happy's the one...
Isn't it a beautiful day, Carla?
It is, yes.
Listen when a guy's talkin' to you!
Yeesh. Even after seven years, you haven't changed a bit, Natsu.
That's right! That's what I tell him, just about every day!
What's that, Max?!
Are you sayin' you changed?!
Well, I feel as young as ever, anyway...
Just because you feel young, does that make you young?
And if we're talking ability, it's improved by leaps and bounds.
That's what I like to hear! How'bout we rumble?!
Sure, why not?
Wait, why is this necessary?
Go for it! This is a perfect way to kill time after lunch.
Alright! I'm fired up!
And So, We Aim for the Top!
Come on, then!
S-Seriously?!
It's not like we weren't doing anything for seven years.
I trained in my own way.
Natsu-san...
Let's try this again!
Sand Rebellion!
Burn!
Hey!
Natsu, hang in there!
You two were just fighting!
That's different than this!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
Sand Wall!
This isn't seven years ago!
Unbelievable! Max...
Then maybe we have a chance against Natsu, too?!
Lightning Flame Dragon Mode!
No way!
Wha...?! What is that?!
Roar of the...
Ay-yi-yi...
Dammit!
I'm not as powerful as I was then...
Since when can you do that?
Now.
Wow...
I-I lose. I give up.
If that had hit me, I'd be toast!
Who's next?!
He really is strong!
A monster!
That must've burned through a lot of his power.
Natsu, I think you better not use that one in a real battle.
But you were great, too, Max-san!
I don't need to be flattered, Wendy.
But if you're that powerful,
Ogre shouldn't have been able to walk all over you.
You may be right...
It wasn't a problem we could solve through force, you know?
Although that's exactly what Master and the others did...
Good point...
Still, the problem is more serious than I thought.
What do you mean?
Gildarts and Laxus were monsters to begin with, but them aside,
our power hasn't caught up to this time period.
True. Even Natsu was given a run for his money by Max there...
And we're talking Max-san...
What you said before really was just flattery...?
I wonder if there's a way to boost our magic power all at once...
Go home!
Poluchka-san!
Don't you have some kind of good medicine for us?
Like one that'll suddenly increase our power a hundredfold...
I suppose that would be too convenient...
What's wrong, Wendy?
Nothing...
I hate humans! Go home! Go home!
What is it, her turn to clean?!
Sorry for bothering you!
What's with that old lady?!
She used to be Gramps' girlfriend!
Wrong, moron!
And so...
I'm going to introduce the next master to you now.
Are you serious?!
Wait. I'm not mentally prepared yet...
It ain't gonna be you!
The fifth Fairy Tail master...
Gildarts Clive!
Where's Gildarts?!
He left a letter.
Master, as well as everyone in the guild,
I'm sorry, but I'm not cut out to be a master.
Well... I will take the opportunity to give two orders as the fifth master.
The first: accept Laxus as a member of Fairy Tail.
That's taking liberties!
Old man...
Isn't that great, Laxus?
Now the Raijinshuu is complete again!
Um...
Gildarts... What a guy...
If that's what the fifth master rules, we have no choice but to obey.
The second: I appoint Mr. Makarov Dreyar the sixth Fairy Tail master.
Me again?!
After all is said and done, we're back to normal...
Nothing wrong with that.
Old mustache man!
That old man is incredibly strong.
I'm going to travel for a while. But I'll come back when I'm in the mood.
Until then, take care.
Here you go.
And Cana...
I apologize for going off again without warning.
But anytime you want to meet me, just make the wish on that card.
It'll get through to the card I have and I'll rush right over to you.
I don't need it!
Cana...
I already told you things were fine the way they were between us, old man!
Fairy Tail is my home.
I will return.
I pray that by then, Fairy Tail will once again be Fiore's number one guild.
But that's not my duty.
It's yours.
Master, that's your last job.
To make Fairy Tail Fiore's number one guild again!
My last job, you say?! Jackass!
Since it's come to this, I'm not gonna let anyone else be master!
I'll be Master'til the day I die!
Booze! Bring out the booze!
Alright, alright.
Boy, he's being a grump...
Well, that settles that.
Man!
As always, you say that at any old time...
I swear that I won't tell anyone about what you showed me in the basement.
That goes without saying, idiot!
Who's the one that suggested going to see Poluchka-san?!
Lucy...
That woman's a force of nature.
I heard she was a misanthrope, but I didn't realize it was that bad...
Why should I count? I'm a cat...
What's wrong, Wendy?
Were you scared?
Hey, what's wrong?!
That old lady made Wendy cry!
No, that's not it...
I felt so nostalgic...
Have you met her before?
Uh-uh...
I'm sure this was my first time... but it gave me such a familiar feeling...
Her voice... Her smell...
They're the same as Grandine!
That Gildarts... Fiore's number one guild, he says...
That's being way too optimistic!
Oh, no, it's not. It's good to be ambitious.
Yeah, if this were seven years ago...
But things are different now.
Of course, there's Sabertooth...
But Lamia and Pegasus too,
they're powerful guilds that can't even be compared to what they were seven years ago.
They're huge guilds!
Standing next to them, even with our main members back...
The Tenrou group isn't any stronger than they were seven years ago.
It's okay! We'll protect you, Levy!
There's no way to make up for the seven-year gap.
Whether we're talkin' individual magic power or the guild's overall strength,
becomin' Fiore's number one guild is impossible!
I see.
It sounds like it'll take some time before we can get back to the way we were then.
I've already waited seven years!
I don't wanna take any more time, Erza-nee!
Romeo!
There's just one way to become number one in a hurry!
Y-You don't mean...
But that's...
Forget it! I already decided we wouldn't be participating in that!
What do you mean by that, Number Four?
Would you not call me that, Number Six?
That old woman is Grandine?!
The same voice as the dragon Wendy is looking for?
What does that mean?
Don't ask me!
Wendy, is that true?
I don't know!
But... that smell... that voice...
They're the same as my mother, the Sky Dragon, Grandine...
This needs to be checked out!
Wait!
Even if Grandine really has turned into a human,
this wouldn't make any sense.
That's right. Natsu, Wendy, Gajeel, too...
Your dragons disappeared seven years ago...
More precisely, 14 years ago, in 777...
Poluchka-san has known Master for a lot longer than that.
In other words, when the dragons were around, Poluchka-san was around.
That contradicts. They can't be one and the same.
Reincarnation, transformation, doesn't look like there's much to go on there, huh?
No.
True, now that I've calmed down and thought about it, you're right. It doesn't make sense.
Even if the voice and scent are the same, the tone and mood are completely different.
And you told me before,
that Grandine likes humans.
What if she hates cats?! What should I do?!
Grandine is a kind dragon.
I can't even imagine a kind dragon.
Especially after seeing Acnologia...
Igneel is nice, too!
Sorry I wasn't nice!
Poluchka-san!
You scared me!
I have nothing to hide.
I'll talk to you.
I'm not Grandine, the one you're looking for.
I'm human, through and through.
But don't you hate people...?
You got a problem with one human hating other humans?!
No, no!
I'm sorry, but I don't know where your dragon is.
I have no direct relationship with dragons.
Then what do you...
There is another world, different from this one.
You know about Edolas, don't you?
I've heard that you've even met your Edolas counterparts.
Edolas...
You mean...
What?!
No way!
From an Earthlander's perspective,
I would be considered the Grandine of Edolas.
Decades ago, I got lost and ended up on this world.
Edo-Grandine...
A human over there!
Makarov helped me in my time of need.
And I grew rather fond of Earthland,
so even though I had several opportunities to return to Edolas,
I decided to remain here.
Are Igneel and Metalicana humans over there, too?!
I mean, are they here?!
I don't know.
I've never met them.
But I have talked to the Sky Dragon.
We didn't meet directly.
She spoke to me telepathically, I suppose through magic means.
She said you people wanted to become strong.
But it may be possible only for the girl named Wendy.
I wrote down this magic book exactly as the Sky Dragon dictated.
There are two types of Sky Magic,
Milky Way and Light Burst: Sky Drill,
two secret Dragon Slayer spells that the Sky Dragon failed to teach you.
Grandine told you... for me...
She wanted me to give that to you if you came by.
That magic is extremely advanced.
Be careful you don't overdo it and damage your health.
Thank you, Poluchka-san!
Grandine!
We're gonna be in it! We're gonna! We're gonna! We're gonna!
No, we're not! We're not! We're not! We're not!
I refuse to give permission!
We're never gonna take part in that again!
We're home...
Oh, you're back, huh?
Did you get good medicine?
Just Wendy.
You don't have the right to decide that anymore, Dad! You're not the master!
I'm speaking as a member of the guild!
What's all the fuss about?
Just looks like an argument between father and son to me...
Clothes!
Who doesn't wanna participate?!
That's the one thing I don't wanna do again.
It'll just expose us to ridicule...
But now we've got the Tenrou group!
We've got Natsu-nii and Erza-nee!
How could Fairy Tail lose?!
But the Tenrou group's got a seven-year blank!
You're fine just the way you are, Levy!
What's this about bein' in it or not?
Natsu-nii, while you guys were gone, a festival started up to decide the number one guild in Fiore.
That sounds like fun!
All the guilds in Fiore gather and compete with each other with their magic!
It's called the Grand Magic Games!
Grand Magic Games?!
It sounds like fun!
Like a real festival!
I see...
Right now, the number one guild in Fiore is said to be Sabertooth, right?
That's right! If we beat Sabertooth and win the games,
we'll become Fiore's number one guild!
But...
I don't know if you guys are strong enough to pull that off right now...
That's right! Exactly!
If we win, the guild gets 30 million jewel as a reward!
We're in it!
Master!
It's impossible! Between Pegasus and Lamia...
Sabertooth isn't our only enemy!
Incidentally, in past festivals, we were always in last place.
Don't be proud of that!
We'll take that crummy record and destroy it!
Sabertooth, huh? I'm fired up!
That's annoying!
When is that tournament?
Three months from now.
Plenty of time!
By then, we'll be lean and mean,
and Fairy Tail will become Fiore's number one guild again!
Sounds good.
Yeah! If everyone joins their power as one...
That's how long I have to learn the magic I got from Grandine!
A festival, Carla!
Isn't that what this guild is like all year'round?
A festival! A festival!
Man! When it comes to festivals, Man!
It looks like we'll be able to achieve Gildarts' wish earlier than expected, huh?
Seriously?
Are we really gonna participate?
Sure, why not give it a shot?
I-I really don't think we should go through with it...
It's a little different than the battle festival you're thinking of, Natsu...
It's not that?!
It's hell.
I've already decided we're gonna do it, so there's no point in complaining!
Let's aim for the 30 million... ahem, I mean, aim for Fiore's number one!
Team Fairy Tail is going to enter the Grand Magic Games!
The beach! Swimsuits! Training camp! The Celestial Spirit world!
Don't say that like it's nothing!
It's incredible! We've come to the Celestial Spirit world!
It's been a long time since we've met the cow, the shrimp, and the girl with the horns!
And there are lots of Celestial Spirits we've never seen before!
And tons of Plues!
Next time: Song of the Stars!
Natsu, help me... A strange Plue is clinging to me and I can't get away...
Make a contract with it.
