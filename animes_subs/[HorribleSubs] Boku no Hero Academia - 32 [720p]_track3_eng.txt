Hosu General Hospital
Two days since the Hosu incident,
and five days since we started our internships...
Since my injuries from Stain were not fully healed yet, I was in a hospital bed.
Special Report: Hero Killer!
On the news, the hero killer was the talk of the town.
Near the scene the day after the incident
When seven pro heroes and three high school students came across the hero killer,
Endeavor rushed over and took care of the situation.
That was the official story released by the police.
Just as the person from the police said,
Iida, Todoroki, and my names were not made public,
and our injuries were explained away
as accidents that happened during our internships.
The night Iida got the results of the examination of his injured arms,
Tenya Iida - Quirk: Engine
he went back with his mom to his parents' house.
Izuku Midoriya - Quirk: One For All
As for Todoroki, who had relatively light injuries...
Shoto Todoroki - Quirk: Half-Cold, Half-Hot
I will return to my internship.
To Endeavor's place?
I want to learn what I can from him.
Besides, they said he defeated the hero killer even though he didn't actually do it.
I want to see his expression.
You become kind of mean when it comes to Endeavor, huh, Todoroki?
I'm sure everyone else is working hard right now.
Everyone's Internships
It is possible that the villains who were inspired by the Hosu incident the other day
will become more active.
Even though this is just a patrol, don't let your guard down.
Right.
This is sudden, but here's a question.
Patrols are meant to deter villains from committing crimes,
Katsuki Bakugo - Quirk: Explosion
but they also have a secondary effect.
What is it?
If we see villains, we beat them up right away!
Pro Hero - Best Jeanist
No.
It's Best Jeanist!
Please do your best at work!
The answer is: to show people who we are.
To give the public peace of mind.
It builds trust between those who protect and those who are being protected.
What is this, a courtesy visit?
Oh, I've seen him on TV before!
The sports festival again?
He was caught by a villain and looked like he was about to cry, right?
What did you say?!
Did you already forget what I taught you?
Deal with them properly.
All right already!
You know, I wasn't caught by the villain back then,
I was thinking about how to defeat him.
It wasn't that I'd lost.
I'm the man who'll become the number one hero!
There's no reason for kids like you to worry about me-
He's too proud.
It's fine for those strong feelings to be aimed at becoming a hero,
but if that is no longer the case...
Now, what shall I do with you?
Pro Hero - Gunhead
How would you fight against an opponent with a knife?
Uravity, can you try attacking me?
You sure?
You don't have to hold back.
Ochaco Uraraka - Quirk: Zero Gravity
Then, here I come!
When someone's waving a knife at you, deal with it by keeping your distance.
If they attack directly, use one leg as an axis to turn and dodge,
then grab their wrist and neck and the same time,
and then hold them down as you pull their wrist.
If you can twist their wrist to make them drop the knife
and kick the knife far away, it'll be even more perfect.
He moved so smoothly, without hesitation.
Gunhead Martial Arts...
So amazing!
Even though he acts cute...
This time, I'll hold the knife,'kay?
We'll keep repeating this until you can do it!
All right?
Yes, sir!
-Uwabami, can I have your autograph? -Can I take your picture?
Pro Hero - Uwabami
Look this way, please!
Um...
When you work diligently like this, you can eventually make big blossoms bloom.
Momo Yaoyorozu - Quirk: Creation
It's like when an enka singer goes on provincial tours.
Doesn't work diligently...
Itsuka Kendo - Quirk: Big Fist
Pro Hero - Fourth Kind
Contributing to the community is also an essential part of being a hero.
Don't drag your feet doing it!
Do you understand?
Yes, Mr. Fourth Kind...
I can't hear you!
Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu - Quirk: Steel Eijiro Kirishima - Quirk: Hardening
Yes, Mr. Fourth Kind!
Pro Hero - Death Arms
How many hostages are there?
From what I can hear, there are two.
Kyoka Jiro - Quirk: Earphone Jack
All right. We're breaking in.
Earphone Jack, please tell the escaping hostages what to do.
R-Right, Death Arms.
Let's go!
This is a pro hero! Do as I say!
I will escort you! Come below with me!
We're saved!
Thank you, hero!
Oki Mariner
Tsuyu Asui - Quirk: Frog
Ribbit.
Froppy!
Ribbit?
How are things on your end?
I've finished cleaning the deck, Sirius.
It's boring just training and cleaning the deck every day, isn't it?
Yes, a little.
It was the same when I did my internship.
I was confused by the difference between the image I had of what a hero
was when I was a kid and what the reality was.
I imagined something a lot showier,
but in reality, it's a daily grind of training and patrols and cleaning.
On top of that, I even had to wash the captain's underwear!
What part of this is being a hero? I thought.
Did you get tired of it?
At first, I did.
But after becoming the captain's sidekick, I realized
what was really important for a hero.
What's really important? What is it?
You have to find the answer to that yourself.
Right?
Ribbit.
Hey, Froppy!
What're you playing around for?
Just because frogs have big mouths doesn't mean you can spend all your time gabbing.
And Sirius, I ordered you to supervise her.
Make sure you're doing your job properly!
I've finished cleaning, Captain.
And I'm supervising her properly!
Ribbit.
Oh, is that right?
I guess I jumped to conclusions.
I see, I see! My bad!
I'm sorry!
Was I too cute for words, Froppy?
She's dumbfounded.
I always say this, but you can't just make your face cute.
Below the neck, you're too macho...
Your face is also too rugged, though...
What did you say?!
When I do this for kids, they love it!
Yeah! They love making fun of it!
Because it's not cute at all.
How cute.
Captain Selkie, there's a message from the Japan Coast Guard!
All right, I'll be there right away!
Froppy, help me unfasten the ropes.
We'll probably be sailing out.
Ribbit!
It's me.
That's right. You're good at this.
One, two! One, two! One, two!
I see. Got it!
The ropes are unfastened!
Sailors! We're making an emergency departure!
-Aye aye, sir! -Aye aye, sir! -Ribbit!
Full speed ahead!
All right, the Oki Mariner is sailing out!

Stowaways?
The Coast Guard got a tip that there were stowaways on the trade ship, Nysan.
The Coast Guard inspected the Nysan,
but the stowaways were nowhere to be found.
However, after more careful investigation,
they found cargo missing from the ship's freight list.
Do you know what this means, Froppy?
Ribbit.
I think it means that before the Coast Guard arrived,
the stowaways moved the cargo to another ship and ran away.
The stowaways may have been smuggling brokers.
That's correct!
That's not cute...
How cute.
The job we've taken on this time
is to secure the stowaways thought to have escaped on a small boat
and deliver them to the Coast Guard!
Based on the Nysan's position,
this is the area of the ocean where the smaller boat is predicted to land.
The Coast Guard and other sea rescue heroes are also searching for the boat.
We will be responsible for...
The sun will set soon.
You guys search for the boat with the radar!
I will look for them in the ocean.
That is all!
Now, get to work, sailors!
-Aye aye, sir! -Aye aye, sir! -Ribbit!
Selkie Quirk: Spotted Seal
Sea Rescue Hero: Selkie!
Quirk: Spotted Seal.
He can do pretty much anything a spotted seal can.
He can even make a sonar-like sound
and use the echo to determine the position of his opponent.
He's also very strong!
They aren't around here.
Guess I'll widen my search a little!
As expected, I can't see anything in this darkness...
It doesn't look like we've been able to catch anything on the radar yet, either.
It's fine!
Ribbit?
We've got the captain on our side!
We have a message from the Coast Guard!
A fishing boat thought to belong to
the stowaways shook off a hero agency patrol boat
and escaped into the direction of the area we're in charge of!
Ribbit...
Captain!
I've confirmed the location of the fishing boat thought to belong to the stowaways!
Sailors!
Turn off all the lights and get close without letting them know where we are!
-Aye aye, sir! -Aye aye, sir! -Ribbit!
Captain, I can see a fishing boat with my naked eye.
All right, block their course with a patrol boat
and board their boat while setting off a flare.
Aye aye, sir!
What should I do?
Stay here.
Ribbit!
Sirius, stay with her.
Yes, sir!
Then I won't be able to experience the internship.
Just be quiet and do as I say!
Let's go!
Aye aye, sir!
Ribbit...
I know that you want to go with them, Froppy.
But you know, even if we're up against stowaways, we have to be very careful, right?
So follow the captain's orders.
Let's give them support together.
Ribbit.
Captain, we've arrived at the fishing boat's course!
All right, leave the rest to me.
Stop the ship! This is a pro hero!
We are here on a job for the Japan Coast Guard to inspect your ship!
Captain! I didn't find any of the cargo in question.
There wasn't any here, either.
That's what I told you!
We were just fishing-
Then, you can show us what's under here, too, right?
There's nothing but fish down there.
Just open it up!
What a pain.
There's nothing but fish...
It's too dark to see clearly...
Can't you turn on any lights-
I did as you said.
So p... please spare my life...
We won't kill ya.
Don't worry!
If we can buy this much time...
Our job's done!
See ya!
Captain! Captain, please respond!
It's no good. The radio's not getting through.
I'll go take a look!
Wait!
Sirius Quirk: Good Ear
Sirius! Quirk: Good Ear.
She can hear high frequencies that humans cannot hear.
Stowaways...
Different boat!
We're fine. Find them.
Mick, start the ship!
Yes, ma'am!
If that boat is a decoy, then the stowaways
should be heading toward the shore.
Hurry!
Got it!
We don't have to resuce the captain and the others?
We're going to follow the captain's orders.
Because we believe what the captain decided is the best course of action!
Froppy, you believe, too-
In the captain,
and in us.
Ribbit!
I see them!
They're hiding in the shadow of Double Rock!
Damn it, in a place like that...!
Cut the engine and go to one of the cruiser's blind spots!
Yes, ma'am!
Froppy, you help, too!
Ribbit!
There's someone keeping watch...
Froppy, can you bring the guard over here?
Leave it to me.
Wha... Wha... What?!
Y-You guys-
If you answer our questions, then we won't get rough with you.
Here I go.
Thanks.
There's only one person on the cruiser.
He's hiding in a cabin.
I'll drag him out!
What?! I can't see!
Mick!
Froppy!
Sirius!
Gotcha.
A villain!
I thought I'd gotten clean away,
but you guys are too persistent!
Ribbit...
Huh? What, you've only got a woman and a kid left?
Oops, don't move!
I'll give her back once I'm free of the Coast Guard.
I'll have you help me move the cargo, too.
Sorry.
We're locked up in the fishing boat
and our transmission's been blocked.
The captain went ahead.
-Ribbit... -How are things on your end?
Tell me your situation. Please respond!
So it's a radio, huh?
Hey, kid!
We couldn't find the stowaways.
Ribbit...!
Don't do it, Fro-
Sirius!
Hurry up!
You don't care what'll happen to this woman?
Huh? How about it?
Ribbit...
Well?
We're going to follow the captain's orders.
Because we believe what the captain decided is the best course of action!
Froppy, you believe, too-
I know.
The stowaways are at Double Rock!
Tsu...
You little brat...!
I'll kill you!
Stop moving around so much! It's so annoying!
Ribbit!
-Oops! I've got you. -Ribbit...
Ribbit...
Ri... Ribbit... Rib...
The end!
You're just a brat.
Since you came here uninvited,
you'll have to die!
Boss!
My brothers!
Ribbit!
Captain!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Leave the rest to me!
No way!
Even if I can't see...
I know...
Damn bastard!
Captain!
All right!
The captain's amazing...
Froppy!
Ribbit...
Are you all right? Are you hurt?
I'm fine. What about you, Sirius?
My body's the only thing strong about me.
Good job, you two.
Thanks to you, we were able to catch the stowaways.
Captain...
Thanks!
You're doing that now?
Sirius, I'm glad I was able to come to this internship.
Huh?
What's really important for a hero...
I think I understand a little better now!
I see.
Arrest all the stowaways.
We were able to recover all the illegal drugs they were trying to bring in, too.
By the way, Selkie, when did you get a new sidekick?
Ribbit?
She's a U.A. student
here for an internship.
Is that right? We made you go through something scary, huh?
Sorry.
Hey, don't treat her like a kid.
Froppy doesn't have her license yet, but she's already an excellent hero.
I guarantee it.
Yup, yup.
Then, I'm looking forward to when we can work together,
Froppy.
Ribbit, ribbit.
