Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
My love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Where am I?
I aintdead?
I see youre awake.
Yoruichi
I see. You saved me.
Thank you.
You should thank your own life force to have survived those serious wounds.
Wounds?
That's right.
I was cut up pretty bad.
I forgot!
Thats right!
Fool! Dont move!
Dont you know how badly youre hurt?!
Chads in danger. I gotta save him!
Calm down!
Chad is fine!
So are Inoue and Ishida.
Huh?
He was lucky to have fought who he did.
Chad was injured, but hes alive.
Inoue and Ishida were able to get away from the enemy with nary a scratch.
I see.
Stay put in this barrier for a while.
Maybe youre right.
After all, half of your innards were crushed.
If this wasnt covering your chest, you wouldve been sliced in half.
I hadthat?!
I was surprised
you were still carrying this thing around.
Did I really have that on me?
What? Werent you carrying it?
No, actually
Even when I fought Renji, I had a feeling this thing saved me.
So I wanted to keep it as a good-luck charm.
Huh?! H-Hey!
Ichigo, lets throw this away, after all.
It makes me feel uncomfortable.
But that thing saved my life.
I want to keep it as a good-luck charm.
No!
Hey you!
So it sank in the underground aqueduct.
Oh, Hanataros in Squad 4.
Hes the enemy, but hes a good guy.
He healed the wounds I got from Renji, too.
How come I have this, though?
I was so sure he threw it away.
Ill keep that.
Huh?
Why? I finally got it back.
Hand it over! No excuses!
Y-Yes, sir. Please take it.
I doubt that its possible, but
we cant be too careful.
Still, youre amazing after all, Yoruichi.
What do you mean?
Youre so tiny, yet you carried me here.
Its easy when I turn into my original form.
Oh, right. Your original form
What?
Originalform?
Right.
I havent shown it to you and your friends yet, have I?
All right. Since weve come this far, theres no need to hide it.
Ill show you
my true form!
A-Aw-woman?!
I see youre pretty shocked. Cant blame you.
You probably thought I was a man by the way I spoke.
No matter how many times I reveal my true form,
its always fun.
Everybody gets shocked stupid.
B-But aint you a cat?!
Cats dont talk. Use your head.
Now, then
Enough surprises for now.
Now Ill show you
how I carried you.
First, about this thing
Put somethin on! Clothes!
Oh, sorry, sorry
I havent worn clothes in a while, so I forgot.
Youre a lot more naIve than you look, though.
Is this the first time youve seen a woman naked? Hmm?
Shut up!
Are you sure? If you dont look at a firm, young female now,
you might never see one again.
Bug off!
Look!
Ughnobleedingugh
Are you okay?
With all that screaming, no wonder your wounds opened up.
Shut up! Put on your pants!
Most people put on their pants first!
Ugh Agh! Bleeding!
Clothes are so uncomfortable.
So you used this to fly and bring me here?
Thats right.
Theres not another like it, not even in the Soul Society.
Awesome, isnt it?
But why is it that you have such a valuable object?
You change forms, heal wounds, and possess a priceless object.
Yoruichi
What are you, anyway?
I am
T-This Spiritual Pressure is!
Him!
Its coming from the Shishinro, Repentance Cell.
Stop, Ichigo!
Ganju and Hanataro are headed there!
I gotta save them!
What can you do, in your condition?!
Who else is gonna save them?!
Fly!
Ichigo!
The fool!
I sensed a faint Spiritual Pressure moving toward the Shishinro,
so I wondered what powerful presence had slipped in, hiding his force.
But its only a tick.
No! Rukia! You cant go!
Let me go, Hanataro! I must stop that Shiba man!
Hell be kill
Rukia!
My stay in the cell has weakened me
I cant move!
Hes damned powerful. Bastard!
Just facing him makes me tingle.
Measly tricks wont work against a superior power like his.
Its now or never!
Take this! Tears of Blood-!
Begone.
My sword is not for the purpose of killing vermin like you.
Hold it!
It seems you did not understand me.
I told you to be gone.
Shut up! We wouldnt run in fear because of you!
Not Shiba men!
I see. Youre from the Shiba clan.
O-Oh, no!
Forgive me for easing up on you.
I cant let you leave here alive.
Whats he going to do? From so far away?
No! Big Brother!
Scatter
Thousand cherry blossoms
Wha-?
The blade vanished!
Ruuun!
Ganju?!
Please stop! Brother!
Phew!
My, my. How dangerous.
Why not leave it at that, Captain Kuchiki?
C-Captain Ukitake!
Yo, Kuchiki! You look thinner.
Are you okay?
Whats the meaning of this, Ukitake?
Hey now, you tell me.
Unleashing your Zanpaku-to in a place like this
is a level one forbidden offense.
Even if its to repel Ryoka, what were you thinking?
Wartime exemption allows the use of Zanpaku-to.
Wartime exemption?
Has the Ryoka infiltration become so serious?
A Ryoka killed Aizen?
W-What Spiritual Pressure is this?
Clearly, its of a captains level!
But its unfamiliar to me!
This Spiritual Pressure
It cant be!
Ichigo
I-Ichi
You okay, Hanataro?
Sorry I let you go on ahead. It was rough on you
No, not at all. Im fine.
Rukia
Ive come for you.
What kinda look is that?! I came to save you!
Try to look a little happier!
Lets go, Brother.
Just move one step from there.
JustJust try coming after me!
Ill never forgive you!
Youll die, someday.
So stay there and live as long as you can.
Fool!
I told you not to come!
I said Id never forgive you if you did!
Youre all cut up!
Fool!
Yeah, youre right.
So
yell at me all you want later.
After I beat him!
Ichigo!
What?
After I came this far, youre not making me leave, are ya?
But
I aint leaving! Forget about it.
I came this far just to save you.
It dont matter if you want to be executed!
Im saving you, even if I hafta drag you out!
From here on in, Im ignoring all your opinions!
Got that, stupid?!
Wha?! What's your problem?!
You cant listen to the one youre saving?!
What kind of a tyrannical rescuer are you?!
Shut up! The rescued shouldnt complain!
Just tremble like youre supposed to and say, Save me!”
Save me”? I do not tremble!
Youre still the same, aren't you?
You still dont listen to anything I say.
What do you expect? All you do is worry about me.
Worry about yourself now, for a change.
Ichigo
Dont worry. I wont die.
I think Ive gotten a little stronger.
Byakuya
Who is he?
He's not the one
He's not the man who flashed through your mind.
Hes nothing. Just an ordinary Ryoka.
Ill kill him. That will be the end of it.
And this trifling fight will be over.
You sure are taking it slow.
Rukia and I did all that talking, but you never attacked.
Who do you think I am?
Are you saying I have to look for an opening to kill you?
Dont talk so big, boy.
A-Are you all right, Hanataro?
Y-Yes
Oh? You arent perturbed by this Spiritual Pressure.
You seem to have improved a great deal.
I dont know how you acquired the powers of a Soul Reaper again.
You could have stayed peacefully in the human world.
But you came here to throw away the life so narrowly saved.
I aint gonna throw it away. Im gonna defeat you and leave.
I told you not to talk so big, boy.
Gone?!
Flash Step!
I can see you
Byakuya Kuchiki.
Hows that, Mr. Kuchiki? Surprised?
I can read your movements!
Dont get swell-headed over a lucky blow.
You fool.
Wanna seeif it was just luck?
Amazing! Simply amazing!
Ichigo is fighting Captain Kuchiki as his equal!
Yes, Ichigos growth is amazing.
His read of Brothers Flash Step alone was astounding.
But Brothers power is more than that.
The Flash Step is mere childs play for Brother.
I must stop them before Brother fights in earnest.
Or Ichigo will be!
I see.
It seems youve improved more than I thought.
You leave me no choice.
Before it goes to your head,
Ill show you
The power gap that you could never bridge,
never in a thousand years
No, Ichigo! Run!
Scatter
Thats!
You!
Its been a long time, eh?
Byakuya boy.
Happy people
Come on, come on, come on
Happy people
Here we go!
Everybody stand up! Everybody fight!
Within your heart, you may feel uneasy
But keep your head right up!
To the sky!
No matter when (Oh yeah!)
No matter where (Oh yeah!)
Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!)
Ill be here for you
Happy people in the house!!!
With a tough smile
Happy people in the house!!!
Lets live!
Wow
Happy people in the house
All right
Happy people
Yoruichi, howd you transform into a cat?
Did you use a special power?
I just wore a cat costume.
I see. So that was it.
I see, I see. A costume. Thats pretty easy to transform-
What?! What?!
