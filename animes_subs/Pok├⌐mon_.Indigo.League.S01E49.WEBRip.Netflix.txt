Today our heroes find themselves traveling through the forest,
heading towards Cinnabar Island, the site of the next Pokemon Gym.
There Ash hopes to win his seventh Pokemon badge.
However this forest isnt as peaceful as it seems.
- Puff! - Stop, thief!
-Jigglypuff! -A thief? Where?
-I bet its that Team Rocket. -Maybe.
-Look, that must be him. -He looks like a thief to me.
-Go, Pikachu. -Pika! Pi!
-Pika pi! -Whats wrong, Pikachu?
- Attack! -Huh?
Whoa!
- Sic him, Growlithe. -Oh!
-All right, Pikachu, Thunder Shock! -Pika pika!
Pikachu!
All right, Pikachu. Show that thief whos boss.
- - Huh?
- Huh? -Pika.
-Uh, whats going on? -Easy. Were not going to hurt you.
- How awful. Are you okay? -Uh, yeah. I think so.
Just what do you think youre doing, interfering with us?
-Huh? -Interfering?
But we were just trying to help you
capture that dangerous thief before he got way.
Hes not a thief. Hes a police officer training our canine police unit.
-Canine police? -These are police Pokemon.
Growlithe, the puppy Pokemon.
While loyal to its master,
the Growlithe will drive away enemies by barking and biting.
I guess that must make Growlithe a perfect Pokemon for the police to use.
-Youre right. -The canine unit.
These Growlithe pups are so well-trained. And so cute too.
- -Look out!
Oh, no. Theyre not going to bite us, are they?
Dont worry. The Growlithe wont bite unless I order them to attack.
-Growlithe, line up. -
These people are our new friends.
Say hello, canine squad.
- -Oh, theyre so cute.
Thats so cool.
Look, a whole pack of police-trained Pokemon.
The boss would certainly love that.
Yeah, but who knows if their bark is worse than their bite?
I believe I have the perfect plan for capturing those puppies.
-That sounds great. -It sound familiar.
You kids must be exhausted. I hope youll be able to eat something.
Ha, ha. I guess thats not a problem.
Did you see the way that Growlithe tackled that guy, Brock?
-it was braver than Pikachu. -Pi?
But the officer playing the thief was holding a gun.
You cant expect Pikachu to attack somebody like that.
Brocks right.
I bet you never even thought about how badly Pikachu could have been hurt.
Of course I did.
Having a Pokemon take on an armed opponent
is very, very dangerous unless it has special training.
I guess thats true.
Hm. So far Ive only been using my Pokemon to battle
and help capture other Pokemon.
Youre thinking of something, Ash.
Wait a minute. I hope youre not thinking of having Pikachu train
with the police like Growlithe.
Whats wrong with that idea? Itll make Pikachu even stronger.
Officer Jenny, will you train my Pikachu the way you train the Growlithe?
Pikachu!
Well, this school is for training Growlithe.
We cant admit just any Pokemon.
Ah!
Maybe Pikachu just isnt cut out for that kind of training.
You keep saying you want to become
the worlds best Pokemon breeder, dont you, Brock?
Hm. Well, sure, of course I do.
Well, I want to be the worlds best Pokemon trainer
and I also want my Pikachu to be the best Pokemon it can possibly be.
Well, if you really want your Pikachu to be the best,
why dont you bring your Pikachu down to our training class tomorrow?
Do you mean it? You hear that, Pikachu?
-Uh, Pikachu? -
Pika!
Uh, ah. What?
-Whats going on, Office Jenny? -Pika, Pi!
Well, its time for our class.
What time is it?
-Its only four o'clock. Uh, good night. -Pika pika.
Huh?
Come on. Rise and shine. Its time for you to start your training class.
Pi!
Okay, first well test you out on the obstacle course.
Heres your chance, Pikachu. Lets show em what you can do.
-Dont let that Growlithe beat you. -Pikachu.
Dont worry. I know you can win.
Actually, Pikachu wont be the only one running this race
-because you have to run too, Ash. -Me? How come?
Ash, a master will never be respected
if he wont do something he asks his own Pokemon to do.
Really?
Ill be running too, so lets get started, shall we, Ash?
Uh, okay.
Heh, looks like Ash is having some second thoughts.
I wonder if this police training will be too tough.
Dont worry. Pikachu will be fine.
-I mean too tough for Ash. -Huh? Right.
Ready, set, go!
Go for it, Pikachu. We can beat them!
-This is too easy. -Pika!
Huh?
Hey, whats this thing?
-How are we going to get past it? -Pikachu.
Crawl, growlithe.
if they can do it, we can do it too.
-This training is tougher than I thought. -Pika!
-Whats wrong, Pikachu? -Pika pika!
Cut it out, Pikachu!
-Climb, Growlithe! -
-Now we have to climb this thing? -Pika pika.
Okay! Ugh, ah.
Follow me, Pikachu.
Ah. All right!
Pika!
Pika! Pika! Pikachu!
Ah! Pikachu!
This police canine training sure is tough.
Are you still going to go through with it?
Of course Im going through with it cause I want Pikachu to be the best.
But dont you think Pikachus a great Pokemon just the way it is?
Yeah, Pikachu's great but I want it to be just as tough as Growlithe.
Thats what you want too, isnt it, Pikachu?
-Pika. -Huh?
Hey, whats going on here?
- Prepare for trouble. - Make it double.
Huh?
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie. -James.
Team rocket blasts off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Meowth! Thats right.
Team Rocket.
They wouldnt try to steal these Pokemon.
They must be crazy, breaking into a school for police canine.
Isnt that kind of like saying: Please arrest me?
These police Pokemon really give me the creeps.
Cant we steal some Pokemon that are more cat-friendly?
You coward!
We can do anything once we get that pack of obedient Growlithe.
Theyll do whatever we command.
Theyll rob banks whenever we see them.
Theyll steal artworks from every museum.
Well be the richest criminals of all time!
The queen, the king, the cat of crime!
Luckily your dream wont come true.
These police Growlithe would never do anything to break the law.
-Dont bet on it. - .
- -Wait till they try...
-Team Rockets esopho-gas. -
Now those Growlithe wont be able to use their noses.
Right!
-Time for our next move. -Ready when you are.
Take a sniff of this.
Just a whiff of this.
And hear the metamorphosis.
What kind of gas is this? Yeow!
What happened to my voice? I sound like one of the chipmunks.
Somethings wrong with my voice.
That gas they just sprayed makes your voice get high and squeaky.
Pika pi! Pika! Pikachu.
Our plan is working.
Yes, were certainly hitting a career high note.
I dont know what youre planning,
but Im placing you under arrest for trespassing.
All right, Growlithe. Round them up!
-Huh? -
Whats the matter, Growlithe? Arrest them!
The Growlithe cant understand Jennys order now that her voice is changed.
If these Growlithe cant use their sense of smell
and they cant understand Jennys orders, theyre useless as police Pokemon.
Uh.
Heh. Their plans working!
-Shall we move on to phase two? -Sounds good to me.
All right then. A little changing music.
Hmm. Pass me that, will you? No, thats mine.
- Almost ready. -Oh, hand me those pumps.
Ta-da!
And now for one more change.
This synthesizer will make me sound just like Officer Jenny.
Sit, Growlithe!
Huh?
Beg, Growlithe! Lie down!
Whats wrong with all of you?
Thats not me, thats Team Rocket. Dont listen to them.
All right, Growlithe, listen to me.
I want you to place that woman under house arrest.
No, please.
No, stop it, Growlithe!
-Well, that about wraps things up. -Mm-hmm.
-Line up, Growlithe. -
No, please dont go!
-Attention, Growlithe. -Now, Meowth, open the hatch.
Roger.
- Everybody, in the van. Huh? - Hold it!
You cant take those Growlithe.
And just how are you going to stop us, squeaky?
Why dont we teach them all a lesson before we go?
Why not? Growlithe, about face. Surround them.
Uh-oh. I know! Well use our Pokemon to battle them.
Oh.
-Whats wrong now, Ash? -I left my Poke Balls behind.
-I didnt bring mine either. -I left mine in my backpack.
-Were in trouble. -You said it.
Dont let the bad criminals get away from Growlithe.
Pika pika!
Uh, Pikachu?
This is perfect. Well catch a Pikachu too.
-Arent we lucky? -I should say.
This should be interesting. Lets see.
Pikachu!
-Pikachu! -Huh.
I want you to get in the car with these Growlithe. Come on, hurry up.
Dont go. That may sound like me but its Team Rocket.
Pika, Pi?
Hes lying. My voice doesnt sound that messed up. Get in the van.
-Hurry! -Pikachu, dont! Huh?
Pika!
-Why didnt it work? -Pika pi!
-Pikachu. -Pikachu knew?
Ash and Pikachu recognize whats in each others hearts,
so Pikachu cant be fooled by somebody using a fake voice.
Oh, who cares?
Growlithe, get that Pikachu and its trainer now.
Pikachu!
Quit fooling around and get them.
- -Pikachu
-Pikachu! -
-Pikachu! Pikachu! -
-Pikachu! Pikachu! -
- - Oh, Pikachu!
-Please, tell me whats wrong, Pikachu. -Pikachu.
Youre dizzy from using too much electricity.
-Pika. -
This looks bad.
-Huh? -Jigglypuff.
J Jigglypuff J
Huh?
Nice song, Jigglypuff.
Listen to me, Growlithe. Team Rocket are the bad guys.
This looks bad.
-Take care of them quickly. -
-Oh! -
Ha, ha. Good Growlithe. Nice Growlithe.
Hey, wait for me.
Growlithe, are you okay?
Growl.
Growlithe, you remember me.
What are you doing, Growlithe? Dont lick her, attack her.
Attack them. Attack them! Theyre the enemy!
Do what we tell you, you dimwit dogs.
- -Not us, get them!
Hey, thats my voice.
I told you dont get us, get them!
Uh, wrong voice.
I knew this wouldnt work.
Huh?
-What are you doing, Meowth? -You come back here!
They should have known. Im just a scaredy-cat.
Let me in!
-Meowth, wait! -Slow down!
-Let us in! -Yeah!
I sure made a big mistake.
Pikachu doesnt have to train with a canine squad to be the perfect Pokemon.
-Pikachu! -I like Pikachu just the way it is.
You two recognize whats in each others hearts and thats what counts.
Heh, Ill try to keep that in mind.
Ha, ha. So will we.
Well, keep up the good work, both of you.
Id like Brock to know whats in my heart.
Huh?
Brocks so good-looking and hes so talented.
I just love him so much. Brock is the coolest.
You are pathetic.
-Oh! -
A strong thread joins Ash and Pikachus hearts together.
It is a bond of friendship that will keep them safe
no matter what lies on the road ahead.
With their courage renewed,
our heroes continue their journey to Cinnabar Island
and their next exciting Pokemon adventure... Uh-oh.
Jiggypuff.
