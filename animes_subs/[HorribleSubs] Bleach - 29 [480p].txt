Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Tsubaki!
Koten Zanshun! I reject!”
Tsubaki!
Fool
Faltering like that!
That was the first time I saw such a technique.
Theres no intent to kill in your attack.
Though you might kill Hollows with that move,
it will have no effect on Soul Reapers.
Have you mistaken this place for a playground?
This is a battlefield!
Without the intent to kill youll never stop anyone!
Wha-?!
So you want an attack with intent to kill?
Then fight me.
Its here in my bow The intent to kill you love so much.
HuhVery interesting.
Would you be a Quincy?
Thats right.
Ishidas bow
Its totally different from the one I saw!
In its appearance and even in its Spiritual Pressure!
That glove
He must have been practicing in order to use it properly.
This is interesting.
One uses an unfamiliar skill; the other is a Quincy.
And both employ projectile weapons.
And youve both come to fight me.
What coincidence! What a twist of fate.
Now I must show you. The true form of my Zanpaku-to.
Spread your wings, Tsunzaki Garasu!
Huh!
What do you think?
Now, lament.
I am 4th Seat of Squad 7! Jirobo Ikkanzaka!
Also known as Jirobo Wind Scythe!
The nickname, Wind Scythe, proves that
I am the most skilled in projectile weapons.
My countless blades dance through space.
No one has seen my Tsunzaki Garasu and lived!
Here, here. How do you like it?
You cant even follow them with your eyes, can you?
As a fellow master of flying weapons, youll fully regret having met me
Huh?
How interesting. Unlike the human world
Here, the so-called strongest fighter seems to be the most long-winded whiner.
R-Ridiculous! That was a fluke!
Dont be so cocky.
You still dont understand?
Sorry, but if youre supposed to be the strongest,
I take back your nickname as of today.
Where flying weapons are concerned, I seem to be the better man.
The name, Uryu Weasel with Scythe,” though, doesnt sound all too cool.
M-My hand My hand
My left hand!
Amazing Uryu
Compared to that time he was battling the Hollows alongside Ichigo
Hes become a completely different person!
Do you lament it even a little?
As a fellow practitioner of projectile weaponry
Your misfortune of meeting me
Melament?! Damn you brat!
You do realize that I missed on purpose.
And next time, I wont miss.
Amazing!
That was amazing! The speed, power and accuracy of your technique
All of which surpass mine.
To think that I should meet such a skillful practitioner
I am utterly defeated.
Please, boil me, bake me, do whatever you want to me.
Why wont you shoot me?
Could it be that you are letting me go?
Im a Quincy. I have no mercy for a Soul Reaper.
Its just that I dont like bullying the weak.
Hurry up and get lost Before I change my mind.
It seems you are a kind-hearted person.
However
that will beyourundoing!
Since you couldnt beat me, you thought you could at least get Orihime?
Or were you planning to take her hostage?
H-How did you know?
I dont like bullying the weak But I dont mind exposing cowards.
From the moment you showed up, you were targeting her, not me.
Most would find it beneath themselves to attack a lady when shes not looking.
An honorable person with any decent pride wouldnt do such a thing;
thats a cowards way of fighting.
Amazing.
And good-bye.
You dont even deserve the time to lament.
Thank you, Uryu.
I-Its okay, you dont need to thank me.
Didnt really do much?”
Did he die?
No
I shot out the Soul Chain and Hakusui - Soul Sleep,
vital spots that control the generation of the spiritual energy.
Hes not dead. However, hell lose his spirit powers.
And once he awakes, hell no longer return to being a Soul Reaper.
As a result of this battle thats sufficient.
Shall we go?
Uh-huh.
Ive heard from Yoruichi,
A Quincy gathers the spiritual particles around them to fight.”
Im sure he uses that glove to increase his ability to gather spiritual particles.
Because of its overwhelming power, in order to avoid harming us,
Uryu was training by himself.
And he was able to master it to that degree
In just ten days, all by himself.
Youre incredible, Uryu.
What have I done in those ten days?
Oops!
T-Thank you.
Yeah.
This isnt
Orihime!
Hang in there, Orihime!
Thats right I promised!
Orihime!
Huh?
A-Are you all right? Did you get hurt earlier?
Ah, oh no! Im sorry, its nothing!
I just got teary-eyed looking at the sun.
Dont you get that sometimes? You know, like sneezing.
Or wanting to go to the restroom when youre at the bookstore,
or your gums bleeding when you bite into an apple.
Well, lets go, Uryu!
Im going to do my best too!
Orihime
What?
Are you sure youre all right?
Huh? How come?
Well
Why am I the only one getting chased around over and over?!
Hey stop, you side burned monkey!
Stop squirming, you lower eyelash!
You with that ugly face!
W-What did you say?!
That other guy was kind of good-looking,
but no matter how I look at it, you have no place to comment on my looks!
What did you say?!
Were going to eat you, Ugly!
With this many on my tail, I cant even win an argument!
Oh?!
Ichigo!
Reinforcements! Just in time
Or not!
Hey, Ganju!
W-Wait minute! Why are you getting chased around too?
It makes no sense to get together!
Idiot! Stop waving at me!
Youre riling up the guys running behind you!
I said dont come this way
Lets go, Ganju! Duck!
This is Iemura.
Squad 4, Unohana Relief Crew,
Groups 1, 6 and 14 are approaching enemy position.
Lets hustle! This is not a drill!
Yes, sir!
That was dangerous, you fool!
Whyd you swing that blade out of the blue like that?!
Are you crazy?!
What? I told you to duck, didnt I?!
The problem is that the time between warning me and doing it
was too short, too fast!
Well, you should have reacted right away!
Like I could have, you moron!
Lets see So, now what?
We got away with a surprise attack just now,
but just cause we showed them some muscle
These guys dont look like the type to back off.
Damn.
Im totally late.
What should I do? Should I go back?
But if Mr. Iemura asks, Whered you go?”
itll be hard to answer.
Oh, but if I dont go, hell get even angrier
Anyway, where did everyone go?
I wonder
Oh yeah! Ill ask those people up ahead!
Ah, umm Excuse me, Im from the Squad4
W-What are you doing, twerp!
Excuse me!
Damn it, stay away!
Who the heck are you?
E-Excuse me!
Whats the commotion?
Hmm?
Huh?
O-Ouch That was terrible
Ichigo Ive got an easy plan to get us out of here.
What a coincidence. Me too.
A-Ah A plan to get out of here?
Ah, ummc-could it be that you two are theallegedRyoka?!
Hey! Open up a path, you punks!
If you punks value your friends life!
No way! Its them!
Arent we there yet, Yachiru?!
Is it really this way?
Im sure, Im sure.
Im positive its this way I think.
I think? Did you just say I think”?
Oh, be quiet. Then, this way!
Then”? Did you just say then”?
Why are you always complaining?
You decide then! I dont care anymore!
Ugh This way, right?
Yup, yup, this way, this way!
Youre positive? Youre absolutely positive, right?
Hey! Open up a path, you punks!
If you punks value your friends life!
No, let me go! Let me
W-Whats with this vibe?
Maybe they didnt hear us Wanna try again?
O-Okay.
Hey. Open up a path, you punks!
If you punks value your friends life!
Hey!
Uh, y-yes
What
are you jerks doing?
Huh?
Well, umm, taking a hostage?
And he looks like our friend?
Youre not?
I-Im from the Squad 4. These guys are from Squad 11.
So, whats the difference?
Heh, I guess its true these Ryoka are outsiders.
I dont want you to lump us together, so Ill tell you.
Clean out your ear holes and listen carefully!
There are a total of 13 Guard Squads that protect the Seireitei.
We, the Squad 11, are lead by the strongest of the 13 captains.
As such, we are the strongest in battle of the 13!
Oh!
Now that you mention it, these guys all have weird hairstyles,
but yours is normal.
T-Thanks.
So, youre from where?
I-Im from the Squad 4.
The Squad 4 is the rear echelon
that specializes in relief and aid.
Ouwie, ouwie, go away!
A bunch of wimps that cant
even wield a sword properly.
Yay, hes all better!
Theyre the weakling pansies of the 13 squads.
Oh boy, its heavy
To be honest, I dont know why they even exist.
Hip, hip, hooray!
We cant stand them!
They annoy us!
Therefore, we, the Squad 11
Hate the Squad 4!
So if you want to kill him, go ahead! Youll be doing us a favor!
Nooo!
W-W-Wait a minute!
Isnt it too cruel to say you dont care what happens to him
just because you dont like him? Huh, you guys?!
Wow, thats a rational argument.
Lets go! Go get them!
Damn, I guess were going to have to muscle our way out of here.
Huh!
W-What was that?
I-I dont know
Anyway!
Im certain that it halved our enemy, so this is our chance now!
Oryah!
Move it, move it!
I thought I sensed Ichigos Spiritual Pressure
I must have missed him.
Hey, you there!
Did you just do that, you jerk?!
Whats with the weird get-up?
Are you a friend of those guys from earlier?
Guys? Earlier?
Probably, yeah.
Great! You think you can mock the Squad 11 and get out of here alive?
Well crush you in five minutes!
Sorry, but I cant accommodate your wishes
Huh?
What did you say?
It wont take five minutes.
Ill be done in two minutes.
Fourth Squad - General Relief Station
So, youre not going to say anything no matter what?
Ikkaku Madarame
Why dont you say something?
Please sir! Mr. Captain of Squad 12!
Such interrogation is prohibited on these premises.
Shut up!
Sir Mayuri
You be quiet too, Nemu!
Just shut up, okay?
Do you want to be pulled to pieces again?
No, sir. Forgive me.
Its not that I dont want to say
I really dont know.
I dont know the Ryokas objective, destination or anything, for that matter.
Then, what?
So youre saying that although youve met and fought these Ryoka,
you were just defeated in battle
and retreated like a dog without gaining any information?
Is that it?
Exactly.
Furthermore
I have not seen the enemys face, nor heard his voice.
So, I have not a shred of information to give to you.
Fine
Then you shall receive a punishment befitting your failure. Right?!
Im surprised.
Since when did you get so powerful that you can punish those of other squads
Kurotsuchi?
Zaraki!
Humph, well, if his captain is here,
then theres no need for me to interrogate him.
Ill withdraw for now.
Lets go, Nemu! Stop stalling, you dullard.
Yes, sir.
Captain
You got yourself pretty beat up there, huh?
Are you here just to visit me?
Nope, we got lost on our way!
Oh, the Lieutenant is here too?
Its by coincidence that we wound up here, but we were worried about you.
Are you okay, Baldy?
I told you not to call me that, you brat!
Then, Shiny Baldy?
You heard me, didnt you?
Shiny, Shiny Baldy!
I heardthat you lost.
My deepest apologies.
Ive come back despite the shame of my defeat.
Is he strong?
Yes, indeed.
He appears to be a Soul Reaper.
He wears a Shihakusho, short orange hair,
with a body-length sword without a guard or grip.
He is headed towards Senzaikyu Shishinro.
That maximum-security prison.
I gave him your description, and told him to be on the lookout for you.
If he heeded my words
you will surely enjoy an excellent battle, regardless of where you meet him.
Hes strong, and I fear that strength is still growing.
By the time he meets up with you, he will probably be stronger still.
I see
And his name is?
Im Hanataro Yamada.
Its hard to remember!
Really? Everyone tells me its an easy name to remember!
Oh, yeah? I get Taro Yamada” or Hanako Yamada,”
but Hanataro” is so hard to remember, hard.
Gosh
Besides, arent you our enemy?
Huh?
Why are you so laid back and introducing yourself?
Ah, I guess so. Now that youve mentioned it
Why did we bring this guy with us?
Couldnt help it.
He was nearby, so I accidentally carried him with us!
Accidentally?! What do you mean, accidentally?
Do you pick up whatever is lying on the ground?
Shut up! You didnt notice him yourself until just now!
P-Please, you two. Stop fighting over me!
Whos fighting over you?!
But, if you raise your voices, someone might find us!
Are we all right?
It seems so.
But still, if its true what that bald guy said, and even if Rukia
is in that white tower,
Oh!
the problem is which road to take to get there.
Oh, thats right. I have a map.
We wouldnt want to run into any Captains along the way, huh?
If we only knew the enemys positions
By the way
There are no roads on this map
What? Huh?
Whats this?
Peace!
Did you draw this yourself?
What? Its better than having nothing.
Umm
Shut up, were in the middle of strategizing. Dont butt in.
Actually, you can go home already.
Youre not going to be of much use anyway.
I swear
Rukia Are you talking about Rukia Kuchiki?
Just as I thought Its her, isnt it?
The younger sister of the Captain of Squad 6,
currently held in maximum security
Then that white tower” you referred to is the Senzaikyu.
I know the hidden way into that tower.
Kenny, you seem pretty happy.
Huh? Are you talking about me?
Yup! I havent seen you this happy in a while.
Is that so? You might be right
He survived against Ichimaru. He defeated Ikkaku.
And, Ikkaku said he was strong.
Ikkaku said he would become stronger still!
Where? Where are you?
I, Kenpachi Zaraki, am waiting for you!
Come out! Ichigo Kurosaki!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll always stay close to you
Now and forever
Yo, how's everyone doing?
This is everyone's idol, Kon! Why isn't it my turn yet?
I've been ready and waiting over here! Hey, are you listening to me?
If you make too much of a fuss, you may never get your turn.
Oh, yes. I will always be waiting, so please be nice to this stuffed doll.
