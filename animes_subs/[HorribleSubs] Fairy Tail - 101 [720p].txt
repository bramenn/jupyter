Natsu, why are you here?
Don't go scarin' me like that.
Natsu...
Natsu!
What's with you? Weren't we heading to the top?
I don't really get it, but I smelled somethin' really freaky.
W-What's that?
The trees around him are...
They're dieing!
Black Wizard.
Is that his magic?
You don't see that every day.
What the hell is he?
I don't know who you are, but this island belongs to our guild!
Don't go bustin' in on our exam!
You've... grown up nice and strong.
Yeah...
I wanted to meet you, Natsu...
Who are you?!
He punched him!
Right off the bat!
Figured that's what he'd do.
I see...
You're not ready yet...
Natsu, you can't yet...
I don't know you.
State your name!
Even though I don't want to kill anyone anymore...
But your were the only one who could have stopped me, Natsu...
It's too soon?
H-He's crying...
This guy takes creepy to a whole new level.
R-Run!
Again!
It's that black wave from before!
That's magic that steals away life!
Natsu!
All of you get away from here!
Natsu!
Fool, don't go there!
What the hell... Damn it.
Natsu!
I'm fine... But he...
Disappeared?
What just happened?
Natsu, what's wrong?
Your scarf!
It's turned black.
How dare you do that to this scarf I got from Igneel!
Maybe Igneel's scarf took the brunt of it to protect Natsu...
I'm going to continue being rejected by the world again...
This magical power... This pressure...
Is it him? Is he here on this island?
At the same time, a new danger is fast approaching Tenroujima.
Grimoire Heart, one corner of the Baram Alliance, the strongest power among the Dark Guilds...
Among them can be seen the figure of Ultear, once an aide to Jellal who has fought Natsu and the others previously.
We've finally found you... Seems like you're still asleep, though.
I believe the time has come, Master Hades.
That man stepped forth on this land long ago, perfected Black Magic, gave birth to countless demons,
and plunged the world into chaos.
The most powerful, and most evil man in the history of the Magic World...
The Black Wizard Zeref!
Has the day finally come when I can reach out and touch the deepest depths of magic?
Begin!
Change course to head to the fairy's island.
Black...
How dare that bastard do this to Igneel's scarf!
Natsu...
How can I wear a black scarf with dark clothes?!
That's a fashion faux pas!
He's picky about his coordination?
Who'd a thunk it.
So then, what about the exam?
With that freaky guy wandering around, it's no time for tests, yeah.
Yeah...
It's most definitely the time for that!
As a Man, I will not back away from this exam!
I promised Gildarts!
And I am my big sister's little brother!
I've got a duty to become S class!
He really was freaky...
He cried all of a sudden, and killed those trees...
Natsu, you sure have a lot of weird friends!
He ain't my friend!
But he didn't seem like he wanted to be your enemy.
I give up.
Continue on with the exam!
Aye, sir!
Okay! Let's go, Evergreen!
I thought I told you not to order me around!
He's here on this island.
Should I return and report this at once? No...
First I've got to make sure of the situation.
Has the time finally come?
The day the legendary Black Wizard Zeref is resurrected...
All the necessary keys already lie in our hands.
We will awake something from within Zeref.
But there is one problem.
The Wizards' Guild in Fiore Kingdom that currently holds the strongest position, Fairy Tail...
One of the guilds that did in Oracion Seis, one of the members of the Baram Alliance.
Some of the most powerful members of that guild are currently gathered on that island.
What?! What?! They ain't nothing!
Guys like those...
Suffocatingly hot as usual, Zancrow.
One should not underestimate the enemy.
It was for this day that I was bahrn.
I concur, Capricorn.
Let loose our desire.
This will be an all-out war for our guild.
Shudder, shards of ourselves...
You're speaking too fast!
I will now explain what Hikaru just said.
I feel that way myself.
And now I will decipher what Rustyrose said.
Desire is to want, and shard means heart.
Meldy, can you fight?
I will fight.
Interesting... This is quite interesting!
Fairy Tail! They do not yet know true darkness.
The ultimate darkness that lies in the deepest depths...
Grimoire Heart! The name itself means the heart of a devil.
Tonight we Devils will have sport with the Fairies.
Will we devour them proudly, or be pound into dust?
The battle is on, Fairy Tail!
The grave of Fairy Tail's founding master, Mavis...
Got anything?
It's no use... Searching for a grave without even a hint! I haven't got a clue.
That's the big problem, yeah...
Are there really no hints?
I've participated in the exam 4 times in the past, so I've got a feeling...
I don't think there's ever been an exam that was unreasonable.
I'm sure there has to be a hint hidden somewhere.
I see. So the second test is about brain power.
Brain power, huh? Thinking of it that way, maybe the words themselves could hold a clue.
The words?
Yeah. Like for example...
Grave!
We think that it's got to be a place, right?
But it could be interpreted as the final stop of life.
That's so negative of you.
Grave... Grave...
A keyword?
Maybe it's a sentence?
Did I just hear something? Maybe it's my imagination.
I'll make this place your grave!, etc...
Marriage is the grave of one's life.
God, you're negative.
There's got to be something more Lucy-like you can think of...
Like Even if people die, they become stars!
Um... Is that the way people picture me?
Well, it might not be that far off, I suppose.
Oh, I know...
That's it! I bet I know where the grave is!
What?
Follow me!
Ooh, impressive!
As expected from Lucy...
She's a lucky one.
Hurry up! I bet Levy-chan will have solved this by now!
Just as you guessed, Gray.
Sorry Lucy, but I think this second test is designed to test brain power and how much you want it.
Just like romance!
There you go! Let's follow them!
Okay!
Honestly, I don't mind searching for them, but where did Wendy and Mest go?
Even though Juvia wanted to go cheer on Gray-sama...
Somehow I have to go my separate ways with Erza...
And then...
Unison Raid!
I was wrong. In the end, you're the only partner for me.
By that I mean, become my life partner!
Yes, Gray-sama!
How many children would you like?
Your face is all red, Juvia. Do you have a fever?
No, all is fine!
I see.
Juvia can barely stand this!
Um, if you'd like, why don't we split up...
What's wrong? If you stay that far back, we'll get separated ourselves.
Is it that you're frightened of me?
I apologize about before.
Before?
The time we fought during the first test.
Maybe I should have held back a little.
But being S Class isn't something to take lightly.
I passed this exam a number of years ago, and it was a tough and difficult road.
It was really something.
And once you become S Class it's not all fun and games. You have responsibilities, too!
You mustn't sully the name of the guild!
And the weight you have to bear, and whatnot...
In other words there's this and that, plus odds and ends, etc, etc...
Juvia wants to go to where Gray-sama is, quick...
Um, it's painful to lose, that's for sure, but Juvia never really wanted to pass this test...
I might have gone too far with Lisanna, just back from Edolas.
Some people may call me childish, perhaps!
But!!
I do not hate you, not in the slightest!
I just... I just want you to understand that.
Um, it's fine. Neither Juvia or Lisanna-san thinks that way.
Now then, if we could go our separate ways...
I see! You understand!
Friends sure are wonderful, yes?
Let's keep working together from now on!
First, we'll find Wendy and Mest!
Gray-sama is floating farther away...
Try it, Mira-nee.
Let's see...
Delicious!
Really? All right!
Looks like you've gotten better at cooking while in Edolas.
That's because the Mira-nee over there was also good at cooking.
It's really like a dream that the three of us can live together as siblings again.
Mira-nee...
But, isn't it a bit too salty?
And the way you chopped the vegetables could use some work.
So now is when you start complaining?
Shut up!
Don't run!
What's wrong with this exam?
Chose a path? Find a grave?
Sure, whatever!
I came here'cause I wanted to beat up Salamander or Erza...
But these giant monsters are all so boring!
So you don't care what happens to me?
I ain't said that!
But you just fight with everything... You don't think anything of me.
Nothing at all.
Oh, so that's it? You think you can take me on, little one?
Then you'd better get big and strong to face me head on!
I'm weak, that's just how it is.
I'm small.
Sheesh, you get better things to do than get depressed.
Get lost already! Stupid Gajeel!
What's wrong with him? And I thought maybe he wasn't so bad...
Such a jerk... I hate him... I hate him!
I hate him.
Gajeel?
What? Who are you?
First, we take one!
It's tough findin' someone small like you.
So don't leave my side.
Okay.
So who are these guys?
That mark...
Grimoire Heart!
The strongest of the Black Guilds... Why here?
So the master invited Dark Guilds to be part of the test?
I can't believe that. These guys broke in from somewhere.
Well, accidents happen on the job.
And on S Class jobs, all the more.
If you can't get rid of a little accident like this,
I don't think I could say you're qualified to be S class.
But they're from Grimoire Heart...
Part of the Baram Alliance...
They shouldn't just attack us on their own!
That'w what's wrong with official guilds.
There's no rules in war-peron!
War?
What is your objection?
We are Grimoire Heart Wizards!
Yomazu!
Likewise, Kawazu!
Yomazu and Kawazu?
We're after...
Me ears!
The strongest Dark Guild, Grimoire Heart.
In search of the legendary Black Wizard, they finally make their move.
Before them lies Tenroujima.
As well as Natsu and the others.
Okay, this'll do!
You just turned it inside out!
Grave! S Class!
Why are all the men in my guild such idiots?
The story that began with the S Class Advancement Exam...
The battle surrounding the legendary Black Wizard Zeref now is beginning!
Righto! Let's have meat for lunch today!
What? Meat again? I'd rather have fish...
I can't get any power with fish. Gotta be meat.
Sheesh, Natsu... You stubborn fool!
Well, if me and him went head to head I'd win.
It's not really a compliment.
Next time: Soul of Iron.
But if you win butting heads against him, how hard is your head anyway?
Stop saying I've got a hard head!
I'm all out of gags here.
