Hey, Natsu... Our guild's gained a lot of members.
There's Lucy... And then Gajeel and Juvia, right?
And now Wendy and Carla!
Maybe I'm one of those bringers of good luck?
You mean like a Lucky Cat?
Or a jinx?!
Now look here!
There isn't any one that really jumps out...
Already searching for your next job?
You've pretty much gotten used to the work here, Wendy.
You say that, but she's only taken simple jobs located here in the city!
Hey, Carla!
I think that doing a bunch of small jobs to gain experience is important.
But shouldn't you try doin' a big job pretty soon?
Yeah. Like a request from a distant town.
I want to be able to do big jobs soon, and be of help to everyone!
Wendy's First Big Job!
Be of help to everyone, eh?
Good luck!
Seeing her so honest and brave hearted... Can't help but cheer her on.
I will do my best!
You should learn from her example, Lucy.
I'm honest and brave hearted too, you know!
Huh? Like, how?
I'm totally honest and brave!
My entire body is concentrated honesty and bravery!
Honest?
Brave?
Why, you...
But I bet that the ones out aways will be surprised
there's such a little girl here when they get back.
No kidding... Like Gildarts.
Gildarts, huh?
Haven't heard a peep about him, as usual.
How many years has it been since he went on that job?
Three years... I think?
There's no need to worry.
This isn't someone like us we're talking about... It's Gildarts, you know?
Yeah, definitely. He's in a league of his own.
Now that you mention it, I have a perfect job for you.
It says they're searching for a wizard that can heal the spirit...
The reward is only so-so, but don't you think it's perfect?
Let's see here... The town of Onibus?
What kind of request is it?
Um...
Thank you very much?
So that's where this is going?
I remember! It's all coming back to me now!
The play's actors have all run away, and the performances have been a series of failures...
My spirit and body are completely worn out. Please make me feel better!
Thank you very much.
Rabian.
Rabian? Who's that again?
He's the head of that Scheherazade drama troupe!
Remember the play we put on before?
Frederick and Yanderica!
Wendy... I don't mean this in a bad way, but don't do it.
He works you to the bone!
It was low pay, and serious labor! Plus, we couldn't even go home!
I'm also against it. You don't have to do that kind of job...
Plus, I have a bad feeling about this.
Your intuition is usually right, Carla, but if I can be of help...
You're good-natured to a fault!
Anyway, you can't handle going to a town you've never been to and taking on a big job like this.
That's not true! I'm going to answer this request, you'll see!
Fine then, suit yourself.
I'm not coming with you.
Hey, hold it. Why are you two fighting?
Do you really need to be so prickly all the time, Carla?
I will take on this job!
Wait a minute. You're not planning on going alone, are you?
Yes! It'll be more good experience.
Hold up there!
Wendy, you've only just gotten used to how we do things here.
I can't let you go on some far-off request alone!
Who's been there before?
Let me see... Happy!
Me?
And... Freed!
You look like you're free. Go with her.
If that is your order, Master...
Why Freed?!
Okay, I'm heading out now!
Be careful, seriously.
Freed, make sure to protect Wendy, got it?
You needn't worry. Leave everything to me.
Don't do anything unless needed.
This is for Wendy's education, after all.
Aye, sir...
Will she really be okay?
Since Freed's with her, there shouldn't be anything to worry about, but...
But he's oddly inflexible about things... He does things his own way, you know?
The train to Onibus is not running due to a breakdown!
Let me repeat: The train to Onibus is not running!
Looks like you get a challenge right off the bat.
What'll you do, Wendy?
I can fly, see... How about I fly you there?
No... I want to do this job as much as I can myself.
So... I'm thinking about walking to Onibus!
That's gonna take a really long time!
Freed, stop her!
It is as you say.
See what Freed said?
I will also walk.
I will respect Wendy's wishes for this job.
It is what the Master said, and therefore a rule.
I must obey the rules.
Thank you very much, Freed-san!
He's so thick-headed!
We're really gonna walk this far?
Speaking more precisely, you will not be walking, but flying...
It doesn't matter much one way or the other!
Words should be used correctly.
For a rune-user like myself, I know well the importance of proper language.
Yeah, that's great and all, but...
Let's go. If we don't hurry, the sun will set.
What?! There's another request from that drama troupe?
Yeah... I wanted to go with her, but the master stopped me...
Why are you doing vocal exercises?
Always be prepared, I say.
Prepared for what?
I understand what the master is saying... But I can't help but worry about just the three of them.
I will go after them!
Didn't take her long to get ready...
And wait, isn't that even more luggage than usual?
Of course!
You brought it with you?
I took it instead of my reward.
During the tough times, or the sad times,
when I look at this wardrobe and these props, I feel better for some reason.
Sometimes I put on the costumes, and put on the play again, all by myself!
You were really that into it?
And I think you're getting close to the cliff there...
Oh, no! I heard that the train to Onibus isn't running!
I knew it! We should have gone with her.
Lucy!
Right! What about you, Carla?
What a pain she is.
She told me I didn't have to come, so I should just let her be!
I mean, why did she take that job in Onibus to begin with?
It's not like there's any benefit to going far off.
Honestly, this is such a waste of time.
Total waste of effort!
This isn't just inefficient, it's ludicrous!
Knowing Wendy, she's probably not using the he-cat or Freed's powers, but walking there.
This is going to be a long trip.
I'm more worried about us three than them...
I'm sorry for bringing you into this.
This is for a companion, so don't worry.
Hey, let's rest a little, okay?
But it feels like it'll rain, so let's hurry.
I can sense the air currents.
No way... With it this sunny out?
What's wrong with this weather?
We have to find shelter from the rain!
With my power, it would be a simple task to deflect the rain.
All I would have to do is cast runes where rain couldn't fall.
But the rule this time is to avoid helping Wendy unless forced to.
But then again, if I let Wendy catch a cold, what would be the point of me coming at all?
What... What should I do?!
Tell me, Laxus!
If you were here, what would you do?!
Answer me, Laxus!!!
Freed-san!
Over here!
Thank goodness.
I see that staying my hand was the correct decision.
What are you muttering about?
It is better that you not know.
I wonder what goes on inside Freed's head?
Why do I have to be stuck in this cramped space?
We don't have any other place to get out of the rain, that's why!
Ah... I'm worried about the costumes and props getting wet...
What?! Lucy and Erza went after them?
That's right.
They couldn't stand it after all.
And what were you doing?
Sleeping.
Righto! I get the picture, and I can't stand it either!
Natsu!
Does he know that the train isn't running?
I don't want to ride it!
But if I don't, I can't get to Onibus...
But I don't wanna ride it!
Make up your mind already!
We can't depart with you like this!
I'll ride! But please, run so that it doesn't sway at all!
That's impossible!
Attention, passengers.
Due to a railway accident, this train will be returning before reaching Onibus.
This train will not stop at Onibus.
It is running between Magnolia and prior to Onibus.
I'm sure glad the rain let up.
But it's getting dark.
Looks like we're going to have to camp out tonight.
We can sleep in that cave,
but the problem is food.
You could at least help us gather food.
Otherwise, we'll be so hungry we'll faint!
Worry not.
I am a man who knows what should, and shouldn't, be done.
Everything he says is stiff, stiff, stiff...
I have an idea of what we may do for food. I will make preparations shortly.
Really?
That's a member of the Raijinshuu for you!
You can count on them when times get tough!
Yeah!
When you enter these runes...
Why winged fish?!
This is near the winged fish's migration route.
Now is the season where flocks of winged fish come to lay eggs.
Can you eat these?
They're really gross...
We tried them before, and paid the price...
Or so you thought, but you were simply naive.
You broiled them, yes?
There is a knack to cooking winged fish.
Are you good at cooking, Freed-san?
I wouldn't go that far, but I have cooked on occasion while working with Laxus and the Raijinshuu.
Looks delicious!
The taste will live up to the presentation.
Now, eat your fill.
Let's eat!
Yeah, it wasn't a problem with how we cook them...
I'm pretty sure I saw some nuts and berries over there...
Let's eat those.
Aye...
No one likes a picky eater.
A wizard's body is their asset, after all.
Wasn't there anything else to eat?
If there was, we'd be eating it...
See? This is why I didn't want to come!
The train between Onibus and Magnolia is now arriving.
This train will be departing in the direction of Onibus shortly!
Sir, we're going to depart again.
How many times have you gone back and forth since yesterday?
First the mountains, and now a desert?
Freed-san, you don't mind the heat?
I bet he's secretly casting some magic to keep cool...
I could never think of making things easier for myself and ignoring my companions.
It's simply a matter of controlling one's thoughts.
It's no use...
Happy!
Wait a moment... I'll make you feel better!
Even though using magic will lower her own energy...
And yet, she doesn't mind! How incredibly kind this girl is!
You needn't use your magic. I will handle this.
What will you do?
First, I lay him down like this.
Next, I write the spell.
Anyone inside these runes cannot feel the heat!
The rock is so hot, I'm going to burn...
It takes some time for the runes to set.
Although it's pointless once he leaves the runes...
Aye...
Is this really the right direction?
I'm sure this is the right way.
Stay back!
Erza!
Just a little more. Keep it up.
A storm is coming!
A storm? You mean a sandstorm?
This area is famous for its cursed sandstorms!
We have to hide somewhere!
There is nowhere to hide in this desert.
We run!
It's no use... I can't get out!
Can't you do anything?
That's it!
Time for punishment, Princess?
Not that! Save Erza!
As you wish.
It is no use. She is too heavy. I cannot move her at all.
How rude!
Oh, no... The power of my Spirits isn't enough?
Lucy-san!
Huh? Carla, too?
We were worried, so we came after you.
Looks like those three are fine...
Erza, what's wrong?
Well, you see...
This is bad. Soon this area will be engulfed by the sandstorm.
Don't worry about me! Everyone, go!
What are you saying?
This weight is odd... It is almost like a giant clump of metal...
Is Erza-san holding onto something very heavy, maybe?
I'm still holding onto the play's props.
Well, yeah, that's heavy all right!
But without these, I can't put on the show!
The job isn't to be temporary actors this time anyway!
I'm sorry...
Farewell, my memories...
Farewell, my rock, my foundation!
Just dig'em up later!
Punishment, yes?
There's no time to escape any longer!
If we get sucked up in that, it will be impossible to get out!
I'll do something about it!
Wendy...
Roar of the Sky Dragon!
The cursed sandstorm has vanished!
You did it!
Wendy... Wow!
Hello! Thank you very much.
Why is he so happy?
I made up with my performers,
so we can put on our play now!
And there are plenty of customers! Thank you very much.
No... Why did we struggle so hard to get here, then?
And I went through all the trouble of digging them up!
I'm beat...
I ate too many winged fish, and now I don't feel well.
No!
I can't even stand...
Hey!
Natsu-san!
Finally, they fixed the tracks and I made it here...
But I spent the whole time goin' back and forth from Magnolia to Onibus...
I'm...
His attitude's totally different!
Falling asleep here is hurting my business! Hey, you!
Get rid of all of them!
It's a big job, so I'll make sure to pay you a reward.
I can't believe this was my first big job...
Why not? Everyone was worried about you, but in the end you were more useful to them.
You've done a good job. You should be proud.
Really?
Yes. I think so.
You're right!
Thank you very much!
It's finally here! Fairy Tail's traditional road race!
Yeah! This year's finally gonna be the year I win!
Natsu, have you forgotten my magic? I'll fly straight to the goal!
What are you saying? You have to run this time, Happy.
What? Me too?
Next: The 24-Hour Endurance Road Race!
But my running speed is so much slower than everyone's!
I'm not really suited for the physical stuff...
Carla's running, too.
I'll do it!
