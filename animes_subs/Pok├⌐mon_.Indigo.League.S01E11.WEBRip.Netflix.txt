With Bulbasaur as his newest Pokemon,
Ash and friends are making their way triumphantly to Vermilion City,
arent they?
There's nothing but Spearow around here.
Well, that's the least of our worries, isn't it?
Just because we're a little lost
doesn't mean I have to stop catching all the Pokemon I can, does it?
-Chu. -Of course not. Enjoy yourself.
Our friends have gotten off track just a bit.
I just can't go one step further.
We've been looking for Vermilion City for ten whole days!
Uh, there's a bug right on your-
-Get it away! - .
Heh, it was just a piece of grass.
Huh? Oh!
I'm going crazy! Where are we?
According to this, we're right in the middle of nowhere.
But it looks like route 24 leads right to Vermilion City.
-Does this trail take us to route 24? -According to my calculations, it does.
All right! Then let's get this show on the road.
Huh?
Hey, Ash, take a look at this thing.
It looks like some kind of giant Pokemon.
-Pikachu. -Chu!
Pikachu!
A Charmander.
Char.
Charmander, a flame burns on the tip of its tail from birth.
It is said that a Charmander dies if its flame ever goes out.
When I went to get my first Pokemon from Professor Oak,
I was disappointed because I couldn't get a Charmander.
Now I can catch my own.
I don't know. It looks like it's in bad shape.
Yeah, catch it and we'll take it to Pokemon Center for help.
Poke Ball, go!
It looks pretty healthy to me.
You think I should have Pikachu battle it first to weaken it
-and make it easier to catch? -Why don't you let me catch it?
My water Pokemon would be stronger against Charmander.
Hold on a minute. Take a look at the flame on its tail.
Char! Char!
There's no way it could still have the strength to battle.
-Ash, try the Poke Ball one more time. -All right, I will.
Poke Ball, go!
All right!
-It sure has a lot of spunk. -A little too much if you ask me.
I think this Charmander has an attitude problem.
Pikachu.
Charmander.
Pikachu.
What's the story, Pikachu?
Pik, Pikachu.
A necktie?
Hm. A man maybe.
Pika!
I don't get it.
Hey, Ash, why don't you try to figure out what Pikachu's saying?
Pikachu, Pika, Pika, Pika. Pikachu. Chu! Chu!
-Pikachu! -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Okay, I think I've got it.
Pikachu says that Charmander's waiting on that rock
for somebody to come and get it.
- You mean it belongs to somebody? - Well, I'm not exactly sure.
If it's waiting for someone, I think we better leave it.
It's probably best if its own trainer takes care of it.
I hope its trainer comes back soon.
Hey, you guys, look over there. It's the Pokemon Center.
The one on the map. Route 24 can't be too far.
-Pi. Pikachu. - Hurry!
- Here's some nice hot soup. - Thanks, Misty.
Have some soup, Brock. Huh? What's wrong?
I wonder, do you think anybody picked up that Charmander yet?
What if its trainer left it there?
I don't think the Charmander would wait around this long, do you?
I don't either, Ash. Its trainer must have gotten it by now.
-Sure got a lot of them. -For sure.
Just look at them. It's a pretty cool collection.
Heh, way cool.
You're the man, Damian.
Yo, I thought you had a Charmander too.
Yeah, I had one but that puny thing was so weak,
it couldn't even beat the weakest opponents.
I don't like his attitude.
Charmander may be weak against water Pokemon,
but if their trainers work hard, they can be strong.
So what did you do with the Charmander?
Eh, I left it on some rock in the woods.
That thing is so stupid.
No matter I do to it, it keeps on following me.
I finally got rid of it by promising I'd come back for it. It fell for it.
It's probably still there waiting for me.
He's the one who abandoned that Charmander.
Yeah, and it's still waiting for him on that rock.
Brock, what are you doing?
I bet it's still up there wagging its tail.
It'll probably wag it so long, it'll put the flame out.
Yeah, for sure.
-Hey, what- - Go and get it!
That Charmander is still waiting for you. Go and get it now.
Why should I?
You lied to your Pokemon and said you'd be back.
Now its waiting out there in the rain for you.
And if its tail flame goes out, it'll die.
Oy, what I do is none of your business.
- Do what he says! -What'd you say, nerd?
You heard what I said. And you want to be a Pokemon trainer.
-You're disgusting. -Pika, pika!
-You want to fight with me? -You better not mess with Damian.
Let's go!
Let's break it up. You know the rules.
Pokemon are never to be used in personal fights.
It's disrespectful to the Pokemon and their trainers.
Yeah, well, tell them. They were the ones what started it.
I think you'd be better off not to get mixed up with them.
They have a very bad reputation.
Uh, thanks for the advice.
She sure is pretty. I've never seen anyone as pretty as her.
What are you talking about? She looks just like all the other Joys.
Yeah, it's a joyful world.
-All right, snap out of it. -Ugh, huh?
Oh, quit spacing out. What about Charmander?
Ah, that's right! We've got to help it.
This is dangerous, going out in a storm like this to help a Pokemon.
-What if we all catch pneumonia? -Well, nobody asked you to follow along.
Got to help a Pokemon in need.
Knock it off!
-Thunder shock, Pikachu! -Chu!
Pikachu!
Pika.
Next time, make sure you don't shock us too, Pikachu.
Pikachu.
Oh, no! The flame on its tail is almost out.
Let's get it to the Pokemon Center.
I'll make sure its tail flame stays lit!
Hold on! You can make it, Charmander.
Joy, please help us.
What is it? What's wrong?
-This Charmander is in bad shape. -The flame on its tail...
[gasps There's not much time.
- Will it survive? - Charmander is very weak.
How could you let it get into this condition?
It's not our fault. Damian's the one who abandoned it.
What?
Well, Damian promised Charmander to come back for it.
Charmander's loyal to Damian, so it believed him.
Poor Charmander.
And Damian just left with the rest of them.
Joy, I'm begging you. Please, save it.
Charmander has got to get better.
I'll do whatever I can.
Charmander, you've got to hold on.
Please, keep your flame burning.
Huh?
Mm.
Charmander's recovering. It should be fine by morning.
That's the spirit, Charmander.
- Wake up, everybody! -Ah!
-What's up, Brock? -Yeah, what's the matter?
Pikachu?
It's Charmander. Charmander has disappeared from the ER!
But how?
I bet it went back to that rock to wait for Damian.
-We got to go back. -But that's no use.
We can't force Charmander to come with us
if it wants to wait for Damian, even if he is a lying creep.
She's right. There's nothing you can do until Charmander realizes the truth.
Oh, I thought Charmander understood that we cared about it.
Brock, Charmander knew that we cared but don't you see?
It couldn't forget about Damian. It's still loyal to him.
-Chu. -That's why it went back.
Hmm. Unh!
Come on! Route 24 is just ahead.
Once we get to Vermilion City, there will be plenty of Pokemon.
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love,
to extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie. -James.
Mm, mind if I cut in?
Huddle up! They're going to be here soon.
Finally, a foolproof plan to capture Pikachu.
I'm so excited.
I can't wait to test our new automatic, high-speed, super-duper, whatchamacallit!
Start it up.
So, what does this thing do, anyway?
Not another hole driller! We tried that already!
If at first you don't succeed...
This time, we'll remember where the hole is.
Are you sure you're going to remember where the trap is?
Meowth, don't you think we're smarter than that?
-Our trap is set. -Huh?
Hey, here they come now!
Hm, they're getting warm.
- Warmer... -They're burning up.
It's too strong. You used too many tree branches.
Me? You're the one who covered it with too much dirt.
Meowth!
Quiet.
-Whoa, you feel something? -I did.
Huh? Feel what?
Pikachu.
Pika, pika?
I can't believe they fell for it.
Our invention worked. We're geniuses!
-Pi. -Come with us, Pikachu.
-You belong to us now. - Chu!
Rubber won't conduct electricity.
Just another example of our incredible genius at work.
You have to be a rocket scientist to outsmart us, the team rocket scientists.
We call these our anti-Pikachu suits.
We made them ourselves.
I must admit, I don't think this is really my color at all.
Enough talk! Let's just grab the Pikachu and get out of here!
We'll use our anti-Pikachu rubber balloon bazooka.
Ready. Aim. Fire!
Chu!
Pikachu, Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Come on, you guys, get up! We got to do something!
We'd love to get up Ash. Unfortunately, you're standing on us.
Hello down there. Thank you so much for dropping in.
Don't worry. Pikachu is safe with us. We won't lose it like you did.
Chu.
-Pikachu. -Let's get out of here.
Charmander!
What is that thing?
Charmander.
It's saying you better give Pikachu back to those guys right now.
It's got to be kidding.
Now, step aside, you insolent little firebug.
We haven't got time to play with you.
Team rocket plays rough so get moving.
Huh?
Char!
You see, didn't I tell you we needed fireproof uniforms?
Shut up and keep running!
Some geniuses. Meowth!
Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again!
Charmander beat them?
Unh! Wow! Thanks for the help, Charmander.
You see, Brock? Charmander knew we cared.
-That's why it's here. -Way to go.
Charmander, how'd you like to join up with us?
I'm afraid your trainer isn't going to be coming back.
Hi, Charmander. Been looking all over for you.
-Damian, it's you! -What do you want, Damian?
I came back for Charmander just like I promised.
So let's go.
Careful. This trainer's already abandoned you once before.
Charmander is mine. I'm the one who caught it, remember?
Damian, you bragged about how you abandoned it.
Good thing I did. That toughened it up.
Besides, what's wrong with dumping off a weak Pokemon'
I wasn't going to come back for it,
but now that I've seen what it can do, I'm real glad I ran into you guys.
The best thing is, I didn't have to raise it myself!
That's terrible.
Raising a Pokemon is the best part of being a trainer.
You wish! It's the most boring part of the job.
How dare you call yourself a Pokemon trainer!
You see? He doesn't care about you.
He just wants to use you to win matches.
-Charmander. -Charmander.
Charmander, return!
Ah!
That does it! I'll crush you with every Pokemon I've got!
Char!
Chu!
Mommy!
- Way to go, Charmander! - Yeah, good work.
Go ahead, Ash. You get Charmander. It'll be a great Pokemon.
But, Brock, you saved it, so you deserve it, I guess.
Right, but don't forget, you're the one who kept the flame on its tail lit.
I'm sure you'll raise Charmander to become a great Pokemon.
Thank you, Brock.
Char! Char!
You got a Pokemon and a new friend.
Yeah.
And so Charmander joins Ash and his friends on their journey.
Maybe getting lost isn't so bad after all,
especially when you're lost with your friends.
Of course, finding your way with your friends is even better.
Okay, guys, we got to rap some Pokemon.
You just do the singing. I'll take care of the hard part.
Let's get it on.
