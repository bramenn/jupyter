And now I am presently living out my dream...
Wonder why I'm not the least bit happy about it.
That way, okay?
Did you say something?
No, nothing.
We're getting close to Nagato's apartment.
Looks like Asakura lived in room 505 in this building.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya V
I see.
See what?
No, nothing.
Anyway, how are you planning on getting inside?
Do you know the code for that?
No.
It'll be a battle of attrition.
What's this!?
Get in here already!
Anyway, it's definitely strange.
She suddenly transferred to Canada...
You already told me that.
And that isn't the only thing that's fishy.
She didn't seem to have attended any of the local middle schools either.
Well, I guess.
I did some snooping and found out she transferred from a school in the suburbs.
Isn't that suspicious?
North High isn't famous or anything.
Just your typical prefectural high school.
Why would she go out of her way to attend here?
Dunno.
Yet her residence is this close to school.
And it's a condo at that!
It's not a rental apartment.
In a nice location like this it must be insanely expensive!
Has she been commuting to her middle school in the suburbs from here?
Like I said, I dunno.
Looks like we'll need to find out when Asakura began living here.
It's empty now.
The door won't open.
I'm thinking this is a waste of time, even for me.
Let's go to the manager's office.
I doubt he'll let you borrow a key.
Not that.
I'm going to ask him when Asakura began living here.
Let's just give up and go home.
What can you possibly accomplish with that information?
No!
We're friends of a former resident, Ryoko Asakura-san.
She suddenly moved...
Did you happen to hear where she moved to?
And I was wondering if you could tell me when Asakura-san came to this place.
So she can phrase questions like a normal human being.
I was wondering if you could tell me where...
Asakura-san in room 505, right?
I was shocked when I found the room empty...
Must have slipped past me.
No movers came...?
Didn't hear where she moved either.
If they get a package later on, I won't know where to send it.
It's quite troubling.
When did she begin living here?
Three years ago, I suppose.
I remember since the lovely young lady brought me a box of confections.
What about her parents?
Do you know what line of work her father and mother were in?
Let's see...
That's right.
I saw the young lady a number of times...
But this is an expensive apartment, isn't it?
I can't see them taking out a loan on a place just for their child.
No, no.
No loan.
She paid a lump sum up front in cash.
I suppose she was filthy rich.
Impressive interrogating.
You should become a detective.
She could have at least said goodbye.
What a pity.
By the way...
Thank you very much for your help.
Lad.
That young lady will definitely grow up to be a beauty.
Don't let her get away.
Oh?
Guess she actually eats food.
Do you live here too?
What a coincidence.
It's obviously not a coincidence.
Then did you hear anything about Asakura?
You know that she transferred, right?
I see.
If you learn anything about Asakura, let me know.
Understood?
What happened to your glasses?
You're making me uncomfortable.
Be careful.
Be careful of what this time?
Let's go.
Where are we going now?
Doesn't matter.
No plan.
Can I go home now?
Say...
Have you ever realized how insignificant your existence is on this planet?
What are you talking about?
I have.
It's something I'll never forget.
During elementary school...
When I was in sixth grade...
I wasn't particularly interested in baseball...
There were people everywhere I looked.
The ones on the other side of the stadium looked like squirming grains of rice all packed together.
I wondered if every last person in Japan had gathered in this place.
And so...
Exactly how many people were in the stadium?
His answer was that a sold-out game meant around fifty thousand people.
After the game, the path to the station was flooded with people.
The sight stunned me.
So many people around me...
Once I got home, I got a calculator and did the math.
We learned that the Japanese population was a hundred million and some in social studies.
Divide fifty thousand into that...
I was stunned again.
Not only was I just one little person in that sea of people in that stadium...
I had thought myself to be...
I enjoyed being with my family...
But...
The things that happened in what I believed to be the most enjoyable class in the world...
Everyone in Japan would find them to be ordinary occurrences.
Once I realized this...
Brush my teeth and go to sleep at night.
Wake up and eat breakfast in the morning.
People do those everywhere.
When I realized that everyone did all these things on a daily basis...
And if...
I was sure of it.
Why wasn't that person me?
That's all I could think about...
And in the process, I realized something.
Nothing fun will happen if you sit around waiting.
So I figured I would change myself in middle school.
Let the world know that I wasn't a girl content with sitting around and waiting.
And I conducted myself accordingly.
But in the end, nothing ever happened.
Before I knew it, I was in high school.
I thought something would have changed.
The train gave me time...
I see.
My inability to say anything else...
I'm going home.
As for me...
So until Haruhi was out of sight...
What am I doing?
Hello.
I wanted to fulfill my prior promise.
I've been waiting for your return.
You sound like...
Could I have a bit of your time?
Suzumiya-related?
Suzumiya-san-related.
This taxi sure passed by at a perfect time.
The other day...
You wanted proof that I was an esper, correct?
An opportunity has arrived...
Is there a point in traveling so far?
I can only demonstrate my powers as an esper...
Our current destination...
Do you still think Haruhi is God or whatever?
Are you aware of the anthropic principle?
Never heard of it.
The condensed version is as follows.
'If something must be true for us...
That's the theory.
No idea what you're talking about.
I observe...
Basically...
Therefore, if the humans on Earth who observed this universe...
In other words, it wouldn't matter if the universe existed or not.
The existence of humans permits the existence of the universe.
This would be the reasoning from a human basis.
That's just ridiculous.
Doesn't matter if humans are around or not.
The universe is the universe.
Precisely.
Which is why the anthropic principle is merely speculative theory.
However, it brings some interesting facts to our attention.
Why did the universe happen to be...
If there was a slight increase or decrease...
You sound like one of those brochures...
Quite frankly...
However, we have our suspicions.
About what?
Perhaps we are just clowns standing on tiptoe...
I kid.
I don't understand a thing you're saying.
I brought up the anthropic principle...
I haven't gotten to Suzumiya-san yet.
So tell me already.
Why do you, Nagato, and Asahina-san...
I believe her to be a charming person.
But let's set that aside.
Do you remember?
I once said that the world may have been created...
Annoys the hell out of me...
She has the ability to realize wishes.
Don't make that kind of an assertion with a straight face.
Suzumiya-san is...
She wished it to be so.
That is why Yuki Nagato is here.
Similarly, she wished for time travelers to exist.
That is why Mikuru Asahina is here.
And I...
Like. I. Said.
How do you know that?
It was three years ago.
Screw three years ago.
I'm sick of it.
One day I suddenly...
Other people with the same powers...
Furthermore...
I cannot explain why.
We just ended up with that knowledge.
Let's just say I give you the benefit of doubt.
I still don't see how Haruhi can do all that.
We found it hard to believe ourselves.
How could a single girl have transformed the world...
No...
And that girl finds this world...
This is a terrifying situation to behold.
Why?
Didn't I tell you?
If she's capable of creating this world at will...
That would be quite literally...
Of course...
In fact...
The world we believe to be unique...
Then reveal your true identity to Haruhi.
Once she knows that espers really exist...
She might stop thinking about changing the world.
That would pose another problem.
If Suzumiya-san...
The laws of physics would be bent.
The entire universe would erupt into chaos.
If Haruhi wished for you people to exist...
Isn't that odd?
Her desire for aliens, time travelers, and espers to exist...
She is indeed eccentric in her speech and conduct...
Her sandstorm-level of energy during middle school...
I would have preferred that she continue to calm down...
What do you mean?
It is your fault.
What did I do?
You were the one who gave her the idea to form this questionable club.
Your conversation...
The responsibility is yours.
As a result...
That's a false charge.
Well...
That isn't the only reason.
It may be a bit late to say this after coming this far.
You can still back out now.
Just a bit late, yeah.
Could you close your eyes for a bit?
It'll only take a few seconds.
What are you doing?
You're freaking me out.
That's enough.
The void within a dimensional fault.
A place separated from our world.
Closed space.
The middle of this crosswalk happened to be...
Its radius is approximately five kilometers.
You cannot gain entry through ordinary, physical measures.
One of the powers I possess...
Picture a dome-shaped space rising from the ground.
We would be on the inside.
Right now...
An average person will be unable to stumble into this place...
Closed space occurs completely arbitrarily.
There have been instances where they occurred every other day.
There were also times when months went by without incident.
Only one thing is certain.
This space is created whenever...
I am able to detect the emergence of closed space.
As well as gain entry.
Furthermore, my powers are not limited to those.
You could say that...
If this world is like a pimple resulting from her unstable state...
Your metaphors are hard to understand.
People often tell me that.
In any case, you are quite impressive.
Not a hint of surprise after witnessing this situation.
I've already been through a lot.
I see that it has begun.
Please look behind you.
When Suzumiya-san's irritation passes a certain point...
They wreck their surroundings...
We can't allow them to run loose in the real world.
That is why closed space is created...
Quite a rational method, don't you think?
The laws of physics would dictate that its legs be unable to support its own weight.
It would appear that it is not bound by logic.
Mobilizing an army...
So you just let it rampage around!?
Please watch.
My colleagues.
Like myself...
Giant hunters.
Well...
I must join them.
This is just ridiculous, man.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
There is one last sight for you to see.
What else could there possibly be?
Once the blue monster is defeated...
It's quite the spectacle.
Do you understand now?
Nope.
Those blue monsters...
We call them divine ones...
Celestials.
Celestials are linked to Suzumiya-san's mental state.
As are we.
Only when closed space is created...
And those powers can only be used within closed space.
For instance...
As for why we are the only ones with such powers...
I would assume that any person would have sufficed.
We just happened to be chosen.
We cannot leave the actions of the Celestials unchecked.
For the greater the extent of destruction the Celestials wreak...
The space you just saw...
If we leave it alone it will continue to expand...
And in the end...
Why do you know this?
I just ended up with the knowledge.
The same goes for everyone in the Agency.
If we did not act...
Quite a quandary.
Please take note of any trends in Suzumiya-san's behavior.
Her mental state has been stable for a while now...
Today's duties were the first in a long time.
Even if I do take note...
Well...
You never know.
I would prefer to leave everything to you, myself.
There are those among us...
Koizumi told me to note trends in Haruhi's behavior.
Nagato told me to be careful for some unknown reason.
Regardless, I didn't expect anything to happen soon.
If I had the power of foresight...
