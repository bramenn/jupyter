Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather comes fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
A wish?
Yes.
I have come here from Heaven to grant you a wish, Mr. Keiichi Morisato, sir.
Let's see, I was trying to call Aoyama, wasn't I?
I got connected to some weird place and a girl appeared out of that mirror...
Wait, come to think of it, who'd she come out of the mirror?
Not only that, but she's calling herself a goddess...
Is something the matter?
Allow me to introduce myself again.
I'm with the Goddess Help Line...
Goddess 1st Class, 2nd Category, Unlimited License. My name, Belldandy!
H-Hello, I'm Keiichi Morisato.
Ah! Those Who Believe Shall Find Salvation!
Have some tea.
I've never had a girl over before, so this is all I can offer you...
That's wonderfully kind of you... Oh!
Here... this is my card.
What kind of business would a goddess like you have with me?
We goddesses have a mission, which is to do what we can to...
So what brought you here?
I am here at the request of Mr. Keiichi Morisato, sir.
Request? I don't remember making any request...
I did receive your phone call.
Oh, that? That was a wrong number!
I was just trying to...
Up in Heaven... I was just trying to...
Needless to say, that includes you, Mr. Keiichi Morisato.
Your fortitude in the face of misfortune...
Your kindness towards others...
This is truly worthy of the highest praise!
But it's nothing special, really!
The balance between your fortune and misfortune has been so lopsided...
As a result, this triggered Yggdrasil into action.
You have earned the right to receive Heaven's Grace.
What do you mean by'Grace'?
It means that your wish will be granted.
My wish?
However, keep in mind that you will be limited to just one wish.
Only one?
Yes. I can grant you anything you desire.
Well, this is so sudden...
And only one wish, for that matter...
Now then, please tell me what you wish for!
So I get just one wish, huh?
I wonder if I can ask for something like...
If your wish is to become wealthy, we will be happy to...
Huh?
And should you desire the destruction of the world, we can make...
Destruction of the world?
However, we would never appear before anyone with that sort of wish in mind.
You want me to believe your story?
You're not from some New Age religious cult...
I would never utter such falsehoods to you. Or rather...
Are you saying you can't even tell the smallest lie?
Yes.
Then, tell me, do you think I'm cool?
Yes!
See, you can lie, after all...
But what I just said wasn't a lie...
Thanks. You're really nice.
I knew it!
The seniors must've cooked this up to make...
No.
I do not understand.
You mean you can read my mind?
Yes, but what I don't understand is why you, Mr. Keiichi Morisato...
Could you stand up for a minute?
All right.
Now you get it, don't you? Five foot three just doesn't cut it nowadays...
Just because someone's tall doesn't mean that he's attractive.
Aside from these overly thick eyebrows, I have a forgettable face...
That is what makes you unique.
I think it becomes you!
That's the sum of my entire fortune... and it's not long after New Year's Day!
That's pretty lame, huh? How uncool is that?
One's financial status must never be equated with one's worth.
I do not believe one is less attractive as a person because he has no money.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Clearly you have some kind of complex about your outward appearance, but...
What exactly does that have to do with a person's worth?
You possess something of great value...
For example, look...
Love that's bursting at the seams...
Old though they may be, and though no one would give them a second look...
The sound of the monitor turning on...
The sound of the video heads turning...
These are all such happy sounds...
They know that you will use them and that they are fortunate to be here...
And it is all because you do not judge them by looks or capacity...
Because you shower them with such affection!
Uh, then... I guess I'll tell you what I want you to grant me.
So you've reached a decision, have you?
I'd like a goddess like you...
Yes?
Yes?
I know, I know. I guess that was a rude thing to say to someone...
Huh?
Wait, I just said that for the heck of it!
Keiichi, sir!
Thank God! Are you all right?
Yes.
Huh!
Oh, no!
Excuse me, I need to borrow your phone.
Hello? This is Belldandy speaking...
Yes. The wish that was just submitted now...
What? You mean that's a viable request, too?
But, wait... Almighty One!
'Almighty One'?
What's going on with my phone, anyway?
Your wish has been duly granted.
So my wish is going to come true. That's good... good to hear...
Huh?
They granted my wish... for you to always stay with me?
Yes.
That means that I can stay with you forever, Mr. Keiichi Morisato, sir!
What!
Is that true?
They accepted that wish of mine?
Yes.
Everything has been duly processed.
This will allow me to stay by your side forever, Mr. Keiichi Morisato.
That means you're going to be living with me?
Yes.
There are some days I'll be at college.
Yes.
I don't have any money! Are you okay with being poor?
Yes.
Plus, I'm gonna have to work part-time.
Yes.
By my side... A goddess always by my side?
That wouldn't be what they call cohabitating, would it?
I'm actually going to live under the same roof as a girl?
I've made your favorite dish tonight...
You know what I love more than anything?
It's you!
Don't tease me like that, Keiichi, sir!
Wait a sec, shouldn't we go on a date first?
Take a romantic spin along the beach or something...
I got this bike just so I could take you for a ride!
Oh, my! How lovely!
Let us go, and gaze upon the sunset at the beach!
Hold up. She's a goddess, so it should be more like...
I obtained this broom just for you!
Now let's take it to go see the sunset at the beach!
Keiichi Morisato, sir?
Keiichi Morisato, sir?
Did you just read my mind now, too?
Yes.
I guess it's for real, then. I'm going to live with a goddess!
But how can I make her live in a dinky 6-mat room like this?
Will I be hit with divine retribution?
Huh?
Well, that should do it, don'tcha think?
All right, let's go.
Oh my gosh! If the seniors find out about this...
What is the matter?
Women aren't allowed in this dorm!
Oh, that shouldn't be a problem. After all, I'm a goddess!
But that's not the point! I need you to get out of this room!
But there will be trouble...
No, no, no...
There will be even more trouble if the seniors find out about you!
But the System Force takes effect whenever wishes are granted...
The System Force?
It is something that I am powerless to stop.
If you insist on resisting it, then I'm afraid you'll only come to grief.
What kind of grief?
Is it even more terrible than going against the seniors' orders?
Morisato!
Did you hold down the fort?
It looks like the Force has already come into play.
Morisato!
Yes, sir! Morisato!
Morisato! You little bastard, how dare you sneak a woman into...
I trust you're prepared to face the music for this.
But there are all these circumstances, see...
He who dares break the dorm rules...
Gets thrown out!
It's human mikoshi time! Carry him out, men!
Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!
Uh, why am I not surprised?
I get it now.
The System Force kicks in when the two of us are about to get torn apart.
Yes.
Wait, there's a problem.
My bike has been acting up lately...
Huh?
Now where did I leave the keys to my bike? Uh...
Morisato!
It's your reward for holding down the fort! We fixed it for you!
This is a new chapter in your life! So we're sending you off in style!
Right!
We'll send the rest of your stuff as soon as you find a new place, got that?
Now then, what the heck should we do now?
Forgive me.
You have been evicted from your dorm because of me, Keiichi Morisato.
We'll figure something out! By the way...
Could you call me something other than Keiichi Morisato or'sir'?
I cannot grant such a wish, you have already been granted one just now.
Oh, that's right.
But I think I'll give you an extra bonus, just this once!
Keiichi!
Let's hit the road!
All right!
Well, he's gone now.
Uh-huh.
A man's not a man until he sets off on a journey like this, right?
Uh-huh.
Can we crash at your place tonight?
Great timing! Can we crash at your place tonight?
If I can just keep going'til morning...
Good luck, Keiichi!
He's got a girl with him...
Don't worry, that guy's easy pickings.
You said it! That Morisato's got a lot of nerve...
Let's rob him for all he's got in front of his girl!
I win!
I win!
I win!
I've cleaned up...
She's my Goddess of Fortune, you see...
Sleep on the street, jerk!
Hey, did you do something in there?
No...
Listen, I need a favor from you.
Hey!
Hasegawa! At least hear me out, will you?
Could you put her up, just for tonight?
You come to my door at this late hour, and it's for a favor like that?
Please, Hasegawa!
I have no choice.
But only your woman friend.
That's fine! I can crash somewhere...
But, that means that you'll be...
Don't worry. I know how tired you must be.
But knowing that you have no place to stay...
Please hurry it up. I have an early morning!
Go inside, Belldandy.
Oh, wait...
Why can't I get it off?
Excuse me, Keiichi?
This must be...
Don't tell me, it's the System Force?
Yes. Don't tell me, it's the System Force?
Yoo-hoo.
If you're here to flaunt your affection for each other, go somewhere else!
Hey, wait a minute! Hasegawa! I can explain all this!
Oh...
We're free!
Oh, really...
But what should we do now?
I guess there's no choice...
Nekomi Institute of Technology
Can't get in here...
What's the matter, Belldandy?
Well, I've never been to a place like this before, you see...
I'll show you around sometime during the day.
There'll be lots of people. It's livelier and fun to hang out.
Wow...
It does sound like a lot of fun!
But I gotta rig up someplace for us to sleep!
A goddess, huh?
I can't just say that I dialed the phone and out she came from the mirror.
Who would buy a story like that?
Still, she's so sweet and upbeat and so beautiful...
If it means I can live with a girl like her...
Keiichi?
From now on, you and I will be living together, won't we?
Yeah...
I hope that every day will be wonderful!
Keiichi.
Uh, you had a long day, right?
I'm going to stay up all night to make sure you're safe!
You get a good night's sleep.
But I've never experienced anything like this before.
So why don't we talk some more?
O-Okay.
I'd like you to tell me more about yourself, Keiichi.
I'd sure like to hear about Heaven and all that...
Very well! Now then, I'll start with the questions...
Tell me about your family.
My parents and my sister live in Hokkaido.
Hokkaido? And where is that?
One day when I woke up...
A day like any other... another one just beginning.
There you are, yawning... your face is still so sleepy.
Because each peaceful day we share is a miracle to me.
This is where my heart will always return...
Forever...
There's only one thing I wish for.
I chase after the same dream, wherever it may go.
The love I feel for you gives me strength.
May tomorrow be as joyful as today...
That's my wish...
There are wandering souls, those who seek the Promised Land.
Go where the goddess directs you. You will find a place that will ease your soul.
