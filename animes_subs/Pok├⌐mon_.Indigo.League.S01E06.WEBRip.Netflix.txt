Last time, Ash and Pikachu faced their toughest challenge yet,
a match against a Pokemon Gym Leader.
Ash won a Boulderbadge, his first step toward competing
in the Pokemon League Championships.
Joined by the Gym Leader Brock,
Ash and his friends continued their journey.
But as they left Pewter City,
little did they suspect that their next adventure would be out of this world!
Ash and his friends hike toward Mt. Moon.
Many strange and astonishing tales have been told about this mysterious place,
and the group's about to discover that all of them are true!
Mt. Moon! Ah. Doesn't the name sound romantic?
People say that a huge meteor crashed into the mountain
back in prehistoric times.
A meteor! Is it really true?
The meteor is called the Moon Stone.
Ah. Now that's romantic!
Look! Over there!
Ah. It's a bunch of Zubat!
-They're attacking that guy! - Dexter, analyze!
Zubat. Flying Pokemon with supersonic powers,
Zubat live in caves and hate to fly outside in daylight.
Not these Zubat.
This is no time for jokes! That guy needs our help!
You're right. I'm sorry.
Pikachu! Thundershock!
Pi...
Ah. Oh. Ah.
Ah. Are you okay?
Wow! You guys are the greatest!
-Really, it was nothing. -I'm talking superfantabulastic!
I mean, two thumbs up! Way up! The best rescue I've ever had!
They say man's best friend is a Pokemon, and with you two, I believe it!
-Oh, that's nice. -I'm so moved!
Such friendship I thought I'd never see, when the Zubat began attacking me.
I thought I was done for, when who should arrive?
Two heroes thanks to whom I'm alive!
I'm alive!
Thank you so much! Thank you!
He certainly doesn't look like the poetic type.
-Did I mention how grateful I am? -Yeah.
Um, anyway, why were the Zubat attacking you, mister?
Ah. Never call me mister! My name's Seymour!
Seymour, the scientist.
Knowledge! Research!
I'm Seymour, the scientist!
See? The cave is all lit up inside.
Somebody has strung these lights through the whole cave.
But the Pokemon in this cave need the dark.
These lights are upsetting them and making them confused.
Which is probably why the Zubat left the cave and attacked you.
Look here. These Paras are planting their mushrooms everywhere,
and the hot lights are drying up these sandshrew.
-Pi. -That's why I'm here.
On patrol to protect the mountain
from the troublemakers' attack against these caves.
Troublemakers? Why attack a cave?
I'm afraid it's because of the Moon Stone.
-The Moon Stone? -Exactly.
The Moon Stone is an awesome boulder a million years old or even older!
Deep in these caves, the meteor hides,
though no explorer has found the place of the legendary rock from space!
We've studied its fragments for many an hour
and discovered it increases a Pokemon's power!
And that is why the attackers are here!
They've come to take the Moon Stone or so I fear!
The Moon Stone?
Ever since I was a little boy,
I've believed the Pokemon came to earth from outer space.
- From outer space? -Yes.
And where, you ask, is the spacecraft that brought them to earth?
In this cave!
-It's the Moon Stone! It sure is an original theory.
But, don't you see? It means the Moon Stone belongs to the Pokemon!
We humans must not take it from them!
-You agree with me, don't you? -Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Clefairy. Clefairy.
Huh?
That looks like a Clefairy.
Ah. It's so cute!
Clefairy. This impish Pokemon is friendly and peaceful.
It is believed to live inside Mt. Moon,
although very few have ever been seen by humans.
Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy.
-Oh, I got to catch it. You can't!
-Huh? -Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy.
Oh.
Sorry, but its best if you just let it stay here.
I hope you understand.
Hmm. Sure, Seymour. I understand.
-Clefairy! Huh?
Clefairy.
Don't be scared of Meowth!
-Huh! Its Meowth! -Meowth!
-What are you doing here? -Looking for troublemakers like you.
-Pika! -Fairy.
-Pikachu. -Clefairy!
So Team Rocket is causing all the trouble around here.
What a surprise.
We've got to stop them before they start any more trouble.
Trouble? Make that double.
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie! -James!
Team Rocket! Blast off at the speed of light!
Surrender now or prepare to fight!
Meowth! That's right!
They sure are show-offs!
Don't you guys ever get tired of saying the same old thing over and over?
-You're just jealous, boy. -Because we won't let you join us.
I'd never join up with you!
You put the lights in this cave.
It's your fault the Pokemon who live here are so confused!
-What a shame! -How will we ever forgive ourselves?
We want to get our hands on the Moon Stone so we can power up our Pokemon with it!
With the Moon Stone in our hands, nothing will stop us!
We won't let you get away with it.
You want a rock? Take one of these. Then get lost!
-Get lost? How rude! -Let's teach him manners.
Keep an eye on Seymour and Clefairy. Make a run for it when you get the chance.
Right.
Ready or not!
-Ekans. -Koffing.
Butterfree! I choose you!
Here we go! Unh!
-Koffing! -Ekans!
A Zubat!
I captured it just before we entered the cave.
-Aw, I should have caught one. -Koffing, Smog Attack!
Koffing!
-Butterfree, Whirlwind now! -Zubat! Double Team now!
What's this?
-Not bad. -Quick! Now's our chance!
-Butterfree! -Koffing!
Zubat, hang on!
Go Supersonic!
-Koffing? -Ekans?
Oh, no!
Ekans! Koffing!
What's the matter with you weaklings?
Ekans and Koffing are getting confused!
Butterfree, Whirlwind now!
Blow them all the way out of the cave!
Its time Team Rocket blasted off!
You may have won this round, but we'll be back!
-We did it! Yeah! -Excellent teamwork!
Hey, wait a second. Aren't we forgetting something?
Yeah, something's missing.
Ah. Where's Meowth?
-Clefairy! Clefairy! -Oh, no! Clefairy's running away!
Clefairy! Clefairy!
Clefairy, come back!
-Clefairy. Meowth's got you now.
Fairy! - Clefairy!
Clefairy!
All right, give Meowth that Moon Stone.
Huh?
Meowth, I'm sure we can be reasonable about this.
-No we can't. -Not so fast, Meowth!
-Staryu! Swift Attack! -Yow!
-Yow! Yow! -Water Gun, Staryu!
-Bye, Meowth, have a nice drip! -Clefairy!
Staryu, return!
Hey! Is everybody all right?
We won't be bothered by Meowth anymore, thanks to Misty the mighty!
What's that?
This is Pokemon food made from my own secret recipe.
The ingredients are specially blended for each Pokemon.
Mm.
How's it taste?
I've been developing it for years. I keep improving on the recipe.
-I'll make a batch for Pikachu. -I'll try some.
Mm. Not bad.
Really? Let me taste.
Mm, ugh.
Well, you might not like it, but the Pokemon sure do.
-Pikachu. -Clefairy. Clefairy.
Pika? Pikachu?
-Clefairy. -Pika.
Pikachu makes friends so easily. I wonder what they're talking about?
-Pika, pi! -Clefairy!
-What's up, Pikachu? -Clefairy.
-Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy... -Pikachu. Pikachu...
Pikachu, where on earth are you are you taking us?
It's another cave!
It's the core of the Moon Stone!
-This feels like a dream! -So the Moon Stone legend is true.
-Look, Clefairy's doing something! -Clefairy.
Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy.
There are so many of them!
-Heh, I think its saying hello. -Yeah!
Look at them!
Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy.
Clefairy. Clefairy. Clefairy.
Amazing. These Clefairy formed their own society.
This is an incredible sight!
Hey, Pikachu! What's Clefairy been telling you, anyway, huh?
-You understand that? -Of course I do. It's my Pokemon!
The Clefairy collect all of these rocks and...
Pika, pika.
Pika, pika.
The Clefairy... Pick up?
A pick-up truck? -Raising.
-I got it! -Pika, pika.
-Sounds like raising? -The Clefairy like raisins? Ugh.
-Ow! -Pi, pika.
-What rhymes with hair? -With hair?
-Hey, how about prayer? -Pikachu.
-The Clefairy pray to the Moon Stone! -Pikachu. Pikachu.
Is it because the Moon Stone fell from the heavens?
Then maybe the legends are true.
Maybe the Moon Stone really did come from space.
-Yeah. -Of course! It all makes sense now!
-What does? -Outer space!
Pokemon and the human race will ride the Moon Stone into space!
First to the moon! Then to Mars! Then together to the stars!
Stars? That's our cue!
You guys don't know when to quit.
You keep away from the Moon Stone or else!
-Pikachu. -Clefairy!
-Or else? -I think we've been threatened.
The Moon Stone belongs to the Clefairy, not to you troublemakers!
-Leave this cave at once! -What's that unusual sound?
-His knees are shaking! -Hmm, sounds like a wimp!
-I'll show you. -Don't, Seymour.
Huh? Did you have a nice trip?
My glasses. I can't see a thing.
-Oh, Seymour. -That wasn't fair!
-All is fair in a Pokemon match, boy! -Enough talk!
-I agree! Let's go, Pikachu. -Pika!
-Onix, let's go! -Koffing!
Pikachu!
Let's show them that size doesn't matter! Ekans, underground.
Koffing, smokescreen!
Ekans!
Koffing!
Pikachu...
Smoke won't stop us! Pidgeotto, I choose you!
Pidgeotto!
Pidgeotto, whirlwind the smoke!
-Huh? The Moon Stone is gone! -Team Rocket stole it!
The match was just a trick so they could sneak away with it!
All right, Onix! Follow them underground!
There's still a chance to catch them!
-Clefairy? -I beg your par-
-Clefairy. -Oh, thank you!
But why aren't you chasing after the robbers who took your Moon Stone?
Clefairy?
The Moon Stone is sacred to you, isn't it?
It's your responsibility to take it back from those robbers.
-Do you understand me? -Clefairy.
-Nice guys always... -Finish last!
We just went from worst to first, heh!
-Got them! -Nice work, Onix! Grab them, now!
-Koffing, counter-attack! -Koffing!
-Onix! -Hey, look!
It's Seymour!
Meowth! What's going on?
Clefairy!
J Clefairy, Clefairy, Clefairy J
-What are they doing? -Waving their fingers.
This way and that way, this way and that way.
I'm getting dizzy.
This is an attack that Clefairy use called the Metronome?
Pika?
I've never seen the Clefairy use the Metronome before.
-Who knows what'll happen! -Clefairy!
-Well, it looks like Team Rocket is... -Blasting off again!
-That was the Metronome? -I give it two thumbs down.
Me too! Meowth three!
Wow!
The Moon Stone.
-The Clefairy are... -Evolving.
Clefable. An advanced form of Clefairy.
These unique creatures are among the rarest Pokemon in the world.
The power of the Moon Stone did this.
I've decided to live here with the Clefairy.
Huh?
It's been my life's dream to find the Moon Stone.
Someday, I will travel to the stars with the Clefairy.
Wow!
When you do visit outer space, I hope you'll remember to send us a postcard.
Pikachu.
So long, Seymour! Goodbye, Clefairy!
Goodbye, Ash. Goodbye, Pikachu. And thank you all.
Do you think the Clefairy really came to earth from outer space?
It's fun to imagine they did!
This road leads to Cerulean City? Well, I guess we're headed the right way.
And there's something else scribbled here.
Yeah, well, they say some kids like to write silly notes on these signs.
What's it say?
Gary was here?
Loser? Oh. That Gary! I'll show you, ugh!
-What's the hurry? -He'll never learn.
Pika.
And so Ash races to catch up with his rival.
Is he running towards victory, danger or disaster?
No one knows for sure, so be sure you're here for the next Pokemon.
