Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Why do you have to keep fighting so?
Whats your purpose? Why did you come here?
My purpose is to save Rukia Kuchiki!
Rukia?
Wasnt it just this spring that she went missing in the human world?
Thats too short. Its a shallow friendship.
I would hardly think thats worth risking your life for.
Its true I know nothing about her
And that it may fall short of being worthy of risking my life.
However, Ichigo wants to save her! So thats enough!
I dont need any other reason to risk my life!
Oh boy, what a problem.
Well, if youre that determined,
then it would be insulting to ask you to go away.
I guess it cant be helped.
Then, I guess Ill have to take your life!
Im sorry
What does the Ritei-tai want with me?
If they wish to give me orders, the Hell Butterfly should have sufficed.
Yes However, it's because this message is signed
by both Head Captain Yamamoto and Captain Hitsugaya of Squad Ten.
Signed by both captains?
Is it a top priority order?
Is that all you can do, run?
Calm down Calm down
I can get him. Theres no way I cant!
Ill let you take the first swing.
You can cut me up anywhere you want.
So, come on.
You can go for my neck, my gut, my eyeball
If you want, you can even kill me with this attack.
Stop quivering! Come!
No way I know I swung down with all my might.
Why is it that theres not even a scratch on him?
Why is it that my hands split instead?
This
What?
Hey Is that it?
Damn! Im not scared!
Dont run around so much.
I dont like playing tag with weaklings.
Damn!
Damn! Why?
I hit him
I hit him
But I couldnt cut him!
Does it mean theres such a great difference in power between us?
Dammit!
No Calm down
Ive got to calm down.
Theres no reason for me NOT to be able to cut him.
Im just overwhelmed by his Spiritual Pressure.
Thats the problem!
If I calm down and sharpen my Spiritual Pressure
theres no reason I cant cut him!
Even Old Man Zangetsu said it
Calm downcalm down
Calm down calm down calm down...
Rid yourself of fear Look to the fore
Retreat and you will age
Hesitate and you will die!
I can win
I can win!
Ill get him!
Chads Spiritual Pressureis gone!
No
It cant be Chad has lost?
Is he dead? No way!
That cant be!
Chad cant have lost
Its impossible!
Whod have thought his final attack would be this powerful?
If Id taken a direct hit,
it could have been really bad for me.
Its amazing for any human to even get into Seireitei,
but to think he could fight this hard
Captain Kyoraku! We have a message!
What is it? It's not like you to be out of breath.
Come to think of it,
one of the boys from Ritei-tai was here, wasnt he?
What did he want?
Captain Aizen has
passed away
Wha-?!
The cause of death was removal of his Saketsu Chain and Hakusui,
and destruction of his heart.
It wasnt an accidental death. He was murdered.
The murderer is unknown.
It is a top-priority message
signed by both Head Captain Yamamoto and Captain Hitsugaya,
so I dont believe there is any mistake.
I see.
Shosuke was
Well, anyway
Shall we go and see him?
Yes, sir.
Chad Chad
Chad Chad
Chad!
Is something wrong, Captain Kyoraku?
This Ryoka isnt dead, is he?
Shall I deliver the final blow?
Chad!
Shall I deliver the final blow?
Leave him be.
Girls shouldnt do things like that.
But
the person who killed Captain Aizen was probably one of the Ryoka!
Hmm Perhaps.
But then again, maybe not.
Huh?
NoIm just talking about possibilities.
Anyway, theres no need to be in such a hurry to kill him.
Lets call the rescue squad and have him put into a cell somewhere.
If theres the possibility that one of them is the killer,
all the more reason to keep him alive.
You understand, dont you?
Yes, sir.
I will make the arrangements at once.
I apologize for trying to meddle.
Things seem to have gotten quite out of hand.
Chad!
Hes alive!
Its faint
but his Spiritual Pressure is still there!
Thats right. What am I hesitating for?
If I lose here
Chadand Inoue
and Ishidaand Ganju
and Hanataro
and Yoruichi
All the people who have lent me their strength
Theyll all die!
I havent got any time
to be afraid!
So, finally you show yourself.
Are you prepared to die?
Or, have you just given up?
Both of those
are wrong!
Wait for meChad!
Ill beat this guy
and I swear
I swear
I willsave you!
Sorry
I dont feel like dying yet.
If I die,
everything on my shoulders will be destroyed.
I can cut him
I can!
Now I know I can fight him.
I know
I can defeat him!
Whats this?
You can do it if you try!
Dont let your guard down yet.
Staysharpened like that
This is where the fun begins.
Right
Ichigo Kurosaki?
Kenny seems so happy
Sosuke Aizen, Captain of Squad Five, has passed away.
When he was lowered from the wall, he was no longer breathing.
Is there any possibility of a gigai?
Yes.
I investigated every possibility, including the chance that
someone had used a gigai to deceive others eyes.
But it only served to confirm the truth of his death.
After this wartime chaos is resolved,
a new captain of Squad Five will be selected
by the Central 46 and Squad leaders.
Squad Seven Captain Komamura Squad Nine Captain Tosen
Would you two please return to command your squads?
I tooshall visit the front lines soon.
Thank you for your efforts, Captain Tosen
Captain Komamura
How was he?
I see
What did Captain Unohana say?
Just that Captain Aizen had passed away.
In order to inquire into the truth behind Captain Aizens death,
it seems the quickest route lies in ending this fighting.
Thenthat means
Yes. I will join the fight.
Nothing would be better than to avoid fighting,
but it seems things arent going to go so smoothly.
Fighting
If not for fighting,
people would not be mislead by ugly emotions
and neither would ugly tragedies occur.
Finally, it is time for Captain Tosens suzumushi” to cry out.
I detest fighting from the bottom of my heart.
Thats good Good reaction!
Your concentration is improving!
Unlike earlier, you can actually hear my bells ringing!
I wear the bells and my eye patch
just so I can get greater enjoyment out of my battles.
Theres no reason for me to wear them if you dont take advantage of them.
Damn!
You take me for a fool?!
And thats why you wont release your Zanpaku-to, either?
Do you realize? My sword can cut you now.
If you let your guard down and -
My Zanpaku-to doesnt have a name.
My sword is out in the open.
It has never had a sealed form.
This is the true form of my Zanpaku-to.
Is that so? Well, thats a relief to hear.
So that means your sword wont get any more powerful than it is now.
In that case
In that case,” what?
Ill be able to win soon.” Is that what you thought?
Youre the one taking me for a fool.
The reason I dont seal my Zanpaku-to is that
my Spiritual Pressure is so huge that I cant seal it,
even if I use all my might.
So, when I fight, I make it a habit to hold back when I swing my sword.
Do you see why?
If I didnt do that, my enemies are so weak that
I wouldnt have enough time to enjoy the battle!
I told you not to let up, didnt I?
On your Spiritual Pressure.
Loosening up just because you found a chance or two of victory
What a boring ending.
And it had been a long time
since I came up against someone who could have killed me,
or could hear my bells during battle.
Is this the end?
No fun at all
Damn!
Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
I dont want to die!
Dont want to die! Dont want to die!
How can I die in a place like this?!
I cant
afford to
die yet!
Move! Move, body!
Stop, blood!
Let me
fight one more time!
I have to
save Rukia!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll always stay close to you
Now and forever
Did you see that, Ichigo?! This is the strength of our Captain!
This isn't over yet! I'm going to turn things around now!
Oh? How?
T-That is Right?
I'm looking forward to it, too.
Kenny, looks so happy!
I'll do my best!
