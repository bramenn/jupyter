Nothing. It's nothing.
Touko!
What?
What's wrong, Onee-chan?
Touko-san?
Touko?
Are you okay?
I'll get them.
Don't go.
It's my fault.
No, I asked to watch your mom play piano, too.
I couldn't hear anything.
But you felt something strong enough to make you pass out.
So the experiment was a success?
Maybe.
But I might have put you in danger.
I'm fine. Besides
Whenever I try to stay in one place,
I get other people mixed up in my problems.
Touko,
are you okay?
I want to stay here a little longer.
O-Onee-chan.
You're right. You should stay put a little longer.
I want to make beads when I get home.
Yeah?
Final Episode: Shooting Star
Are you sure we should have left Onee-chan there?
I'm sure.
I wonder what happened to her, though.
I wonder.
She's getting to that age.
What? Are you saying I'm the only kid here?
You're almost an adult, too.
It'll happen before you know it.
One more piece?
Yes, please. I'll go home after that.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Um! Something really dramatic.
Okay, got it.
I'm not afraid.
It's not a future that's about to happen.
But Kakeru-kun...
Kakeru-kun will be gone.
Thanks for waiting.
I'm surprised you all ordered Mandheling, though.
I'm nervous for some reason.
Yeah. I feel weird.
It's bitter.
I wish Touko-san were here, too.
Remember when the five of us used to get together randomly all the time?
I'll try calling her.
What's up?
I want to meet her by chance.
That's a nice thing to say for once, coming from you.
For once, yeah.
Sorry, I rocked the boat.
I'll tell you both, too.
You don't have to.
Everyone has secrets.
Well, small ones.
Maybe it's because we all got together for coffee.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Huh, where's Onee-chan?
Dunno.
Is she in the studio again so early?
Hina,
it looks like that girl came home in a huge hurry to finish her homework.
Don't get in her way.
Fine.
Hey, Hina, it says there's going to be a meteor shower today.
Brings back memories of that night.
Mari said she wanted to watch the meteor showers,
so I decided to propose.
Dad, move your newspaper.
Kakeru,
have you decided?
You're a grown-up, now.
You can do whatever you like, and I'll help out as much as I can.
It was pretty tough until middle school.
You're a kid until middle school, a grown-up in high school.
That's where the line is for me, anyway.
And not for any real reason.
So you're still hiking, huh?
Yeah, though not so much hiking as just walking around the foothills.
Remember you weren't so enthusiastic about it when I first invited you?
Yeah, I eventually got into it.
It's been a while since we stopped hiking together.
Can you keep up with me, Dad?
That's quite a statement.
Hey, dear, come help.
I'll get it.
Thanks.
Yes?
Takayama.
Let's take a short break.
Hina-chan tells me your mom held a piano recital.
It wasn't really a recital.
Nothing so grand.
You should invite me next time, too.
Takayama, you're
Yanagi.
Call me Yanagi.
Do you like classical music?
Actually, I listen to it quite a bit.
Your tea's always so good, Mom.
Thanks.
Say, Touko, have you ever
seen something in a haze when you're suddenly in a bright light?
That'd happen to me sometimes when I was young,
and I even thought it might have been my future.
But it wasn't.
Everything that happened afterwards was totally unexpected.
I wonder what it was, anyway.
Does that help you move on?
I don't know, but it's all I can do right now.
You're right. You have to do everything you can.
You have to fulfill your promise.
I'll remind you if you've forgotten.
I remember.
I've promised you only one thing.
Want to sit?
Tell me later.
I heard the gist of it from Sachi.
I see.
The incident at the beach where I was forced
to make that promise with you, and this time, when Touko collapsed
both are my fault.
How much of that am I supposed to believe?
It's hard to believe all of it.
I don't mind, but it's the truth.
Besides, it's true that I needed Touko to be here.
But if I weren't here, Touko wouldn't have gone through all this.
I hurt Touko.
I don't even have a clue what Touko saw.
It's not all good,
coming to an epiphany.
What?
Are you talking about Yukinari Imi?
Yeah, it's about Yuki.
He doesn't need to say anything for me to know what he's thinking.
Yeah, that does sound a bit troublesome.
So,
Kakeru, are you going away?
I get that feeling.
I'm heading out.
Be careful.
Where's she going this late in the afternoon?
I don't know, but she was pretty excited.
Where's Onee-chan off to so late?
My, my, everyone's worried about Onee-chan.
Kakeru-kun?
Touko.
Can I sit next to you?
Sure.
There's supposed to be a meteor shower tonight.
It'll be great if we can watch it again, the way we did the fireworks.
I hope we can watch the fireworks together again.
Maybe not with this weather.
Fireworks in the winter.
In the winter?
In the fragment of the future,
we decided to watch the fireworks in the winter.
So did you?
Yeah.
I went alone.
And the others?
They didn't notice me.
I see, so you watched them alone.
It was the first time I ever watched the fireworks alone.
It might have been a sudden, expected loneliness.
I wish I saw it, too.
You were watching, too.
With the others.
Did that me seem happy?
Yeah, very.
That's good.
I wonder what the fragments of the future really were.
Maybe that name isn't appropriate anymore.
Mom said
Never mind.
There you go with your never mind again.
But whenever you say that, it was actually something important.
Am I that obvious?
Not really.
I see.
I guess.
Something important.
That day of the fireworks festival, I saw you.
Was that a coincidence?
Not quite.
It wasn't a coincidence.
You saw it because you wanted to see it.
It wasn't the future.
It's something that hasn't happened, but it's sure to happen.
What? Isn't that the same thing?
Did you mean it to be the same thing?
Maybe not.
Then it probably means something else.
I wanted to see you.
I wanted to see you.
So I saw you?
And the sound and lights from the fireworks might have made it happen.
It was really loud and bright, huh?
But why me?
I couldn't do anything for you, even during the fireworks in the winter.
I just felt like I understood how you feel a little better.
I couldn't do anything for you.
That's enough.
It is?
I'm glad I met you in this town.
I'm glad you came to this town.
Can't see the stars.
Oh, yeah,
maybe these will be stars.
You made all these?
Yup.
Wow.
Ready, and...
Shooting stars.
Yeah.
You see them, too?
Yeah.
This year's meteor shower comes unusually late.
The peak of the Kappa Cygnids meteor shower reaches its peak today;
unfortunately there is cloud cover throughout much of Japan,
and it may not be visible
I wanted to see it.
I know.
I can see it!
You can?
It...
was a beautiful proposal.
When we first met and when we went on our first date,
you were so desperate.
You won me over.
Why is Jonathan the only Jonathan?
Are you okay, Yuki-kun?
It's still hot outside.
No,
I mean, the rest of them all have philosophers' names.
What? Then what about Jonathan?
An adventurer, arguably?
You've been drawing them all the time. You didn't know?
I didn't know.
Summer break's almost over.
I hope no matter what happens from now on,
my future self will solve it all for me!
You haven't changed at all.
Have you?
He's back on track lately.
Here he comes.
What?
Oh, come on.
It's over.
Hina.
Where's Hina?
Hina, explain, dammit!
Hina!
Adjust focus there.
I see it.
I like the name Touko.
Sure.
But I love the name Hiro, too.
Kazemichi
Should I help with something?
You're a customer for today.
You're late.
Isn't she going to be late?
Huh?
Summer break's over for us youngins, unlike you.
There's something wrong. You didn't sleep in.
Did something good happen?
That tragic glasses girl is coming to school.
Ack!
Good for you. I'll give you a lift to celebrate.
The only way I'd be late today would be because you gave me a ride.
Tee hee.
This is another benefit of running, I guess.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Watch for cars, you two.
Touko.
