H!
O?!
I do fall in love!
I just realised it for the first time
That I had fallen in love
Twenty-four hours a day thinking of you, you and nothing more than you!
It's something I wasn't consciously aware of
Somehow ( somehow) I'm feeling different from the usual
With you ( the two of us) and our dull chatter
Don't tell me ( mutual love?) Nope, it's a one-sided crush
This is bad! Our gazes met!
What, what? Why is my heart pounding like this?
Did a short circuit just make a mess out of my mind?
This is my first time... feeling like this...
I wonder if I have a fever
Suddenly and precipitately, love has arrived.
Instantly igniting my face into a bright red
T-That's stupid?! My hands are shaking
Is this really what they call love?
I-I did it! A conversation filled with stutters
This awkward silence... *mumble mumble*
Your... ( Your...) I want to know your feelings.
O-One-sided love
First love! The usual way to school
The shining light. I do fall in love!
I feel I could fly towards the sky
O-One-sided love

H H!
Woke up in the morning, brushed my teeth
In the blink of an eye, it's 10pm
Today, we laughed a whole lot
We had a great time
At times, with my friends, acting like fools, being noisy
Fluttering, our eyes met.
It's a coincidence, right?
I wouldn't call this my first love
It's not my character.
Say, will we be able to meet again tomorrow?
As my eyelids close
I see you sparkling all over the place
Today was fun, too, wasn't it?
I'm in love
So happy, so happy
It is my pleasure to meet you, my new-found love.
Surely, we'll meet again tomorrow
Have a good night
We'll meet immediately in our dreams
So have a good night

Finally
Narration: Satomi Koorogi
Wow, it sure is hot.
It's hot!
Tanaka-kun, the only thing you've said so far is that it's hot.
It's already hot enough, so if you say it more, it's going to feel hotter.
I ban you from saying, It's hot.
Okay, okay.
Well...
It sure is summery!
Summery... Summery...
Just kidding...
But it really sure is summery!
It's way too summery!
Summery!
This guy... I have no choice but to punch him.
It really is much too summery!
It is really summery!
Shiny!
Everything looks so very bright today!
The air, the people and even this classroom.
The reason for that is...
I did my homework today!
I'm going to show it off to Mio-chan.
Huh...
Huh?
W-What?
It's not here!
No way!
That's not possible!
I did my homework!
Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why isn't it here!?
I guess I can just copy it.
Mio-chan...
Wait...
Wait a second...
Today's homework was a worksheet!
Now I've done it.
What is it, Yukko?
You're all worked up this morning.
I forgot my homework.
I hope aliens invade.
You forgot it again?
Don't underestimate me!
I did my homework, but I lost it!
I'm not underestimating you...
You're talking about the Languages Worksheet, right?
Maybe it's stuck between something.
Look for it more carefully.
I already tried looking for it just now.
It's definitely no -
Huh?
Whoa...
Whoa!
My God!
What do you mean, Daihuku Fair!?
What do you mean, a fair...?
Well, you know...
Maybe there are extra copies of the worksheet in the teacher's desk.
Ah!
You're kidding!
There were actually extra copies?
Damn it!
Damn it!
You're going back to get it?
You're not going to make it back in time!
Even so I'm...
I'm still going!
Hey, class is about to start.
Go sit down.
Spin, spin, spin...
Turn, turn, turn...
Don't be hasty, and things will turn.
I had to stand outside again...
Why am I always forgetting my homework?
And I actually did my homework this time. I just forgot it!
God is just playing with me.
Sakamoto.
Hm?
Here's my business card.
What is this?
What am I supposed to do with this?
What is this?
What am I supposed to do?
Oh, I'm sorr -
What is it, Tachibana Misato?
What?
There are some new products out,
so I was just wondering what I should get!
I see.
Then, this one is -
Why should I listen to what you have to say!?
- not very good, so you should have chosen the one next to it.
Sorry for disturbing you.
I didn't buy this because you recommended it!
I heard there were going to be stands set up in our neighbourhood,
so I decided to check them out.
My main objective is the shooting stand.
I've only seen it on TV, so I'm excited for today!
That being said, I only have 500 yen today.
I wonder if this is enough.
One try: five million yen!
Lucky!
Five hundred yen exactly.
I wanted to eat yakisoba, but I came here for this today!
There are only caramels and eggplants.
Excuse me...
Is this all you have?
What do you mean by that?
We only carry high-quality and branded products!
Well, I did already pay.
I need to bring something home.
Young lady, you can't just hit something high-tier right off the bat!
It's not going to fall that easily!
High-tier?
You're going to have to hit something easier first.
The only other option I have to hit is the caramels.
What!?
That was so close!
The caramels must be completely stuck.
You were only a few more millimetres away from knocking it over!
Young lady, you're pretty good at this.
Are you possibly some undercover gun professional?
Just kidding!
This eggplant isn't even budging!
Hey, what's with the sad face?
I bet you think I'm ripping you off.
Although this stand looks pretty shabby,
I guarantee that we are happy and fair!
No matter how you look at this, there's something wrong!
What is that?
Look at that!
I can definitely see a nail there!
A nail!
This is definitely cheating!
Hey, why are you being unresponsive!?
More importantly, these things shouldn't be allowed!
You were so happy a few moments back!
I bet you're doing something with the caramels, too!
Why are you faking sleep?
What am I supposed to hit with my last one?
Never come back.
What the heck?
Things you think are cool!
Mio-chan!
Here I go!
Whoa.
Yeah!
Nice catch!
Oh, superball!
Things you think are cool!
Crap, that was so close!
Wow!
Oh, slipstream!
Thank you.
This is fun. It's been a while since I've gone to an amusement park.
You've got to go sometime.
I want to buy some juice, so could you give me my wallet?
Oh, right.
I'm holding onto it for you.
Well, thanks.
I felt like I'd lose it if I kept it.
That's true.
What?!
What? What? What?
I'm sure it was in here.
It seems like I dropped your wallet.
I know!
Let's check the lost and found!
It might be there!
How much was in it?
4016 yen.
That's really specific.
Um, I'm looking for a brown wallet that has a snake skin inside.
Oh, I've received that.
Thank goodness they had it.
I really wasn't sure what I was going to do for a bit there!
Attention: a child with denim shorts,
a denim shirt and a denim hat is looking for her mother.
If this is your child, please come to the information centre.
I'm really bad with haunted houses!
A mummy!
All right.
I'm taking it.
That's three lattes to go, correct?
Um, I'd also like one of these, one of these and one of these.
Um, I'm sorry, but could you say the name?
I'm Sakurai.
No, not that...
Oh, I see, I'm sorry.
I'm Izumi.
Sakurai Izumi.
No, I didn't mean your family name...
I've always been told that both of my names sound like family names.
No, by name I meant the product name.
What do you mean by product name?
I'm sorry.
I don't really understand.
Um, I'm sorry.
Ah, that was good.
I ate a lot.
All that's left is to wait to order dessert.
Yep.
Then I'll do it, too.
I'm done!
Me, too.
Whoa, nice.
Way to go, Mai-chan.
How about you, Yukko?
You done?
A crane?
Nano! Look, look! Ta-da!
I put one on, too.
Now, we match!
That's true.
I'm Nano for the whole day today,
so you'd better not call me Professor.
All right, Nano-chan.
That was quick!
Professor, are you already done?
Ah, Nano, you just said Professor!
But you already took off the key.
I'm just taking a bit of a break right now.
But I'm Nano for today.
All right.
Oh, Professor - I mean Nano-chan, would you like to play together?
Okay.
Play what?
We'll play swap, where you become me and I become you.
Let's do it!
Then, Professor - I mean Nano-chan, please put on the key.
All right!
And I'm the Professor, so take off my key.
I can't do that.
Hey, hey, what are we going to play? Cards?
Oh, these snacks taste good.
I was saving those snacks!
But right now, I'm the Professor.
I don't get it!
I became Nano, so Nano became the Professor and ate the snacks!
Nano should just be Nano!
Crabs...
Then, since I've returned to being Nano, I'll go buy food for dinner.
I'll go, too!
I'm not buying any snacks.
Buy chocolate sharks and strawberry juice!
I won't.
Buy them!
Hey, don't forget about my food.
The Shinonome household was at peace again today.
The next person that says something in English loses.
Okay.
Ah, Mio-chan, you just said something in English.
You didn't say start, so I'm safe.
Then I'll say a bunch of English before saying start.
Do you know a lot of English?
Okay.
Carbonation is tickly, so it makes me feel awake.
Huh?
I was asleep...
Oh, Sleeping Beauty woke up without a kiss.
Why?
What do you mean, Why?
I'm the cider.
I put a spell on these bubbles to make it taste good.
Next time on Nichijou, Episode 13.
Look forward to it!
