Here we come!
It's the start of Inuyasha!
We're going to gatherall the shards of the Sacred Jewel...
and I'll destroy Naraku with my Tetsusaiga!
We're on a journey in search of Naraku who has disappeared.
Together, we've managed to overcome many hardships,
but a dark shadow will cast over the hearts of my friends.
Miroku, Sango, Shippo and Kirara...
travel back in time!
To a Feudal Fairytale!
Inuyasha!
Well, Inuyasha?
Have you found the way out?
Shaddup! I'm trying to concentrate!
You've been at it since morning and it's getting dark.
Why're you shaking?
Miroku, this forest must be...
Yes, there's no doubt about it.
This is a demon's nest.
Shucks! Did it again!
Damn! Get rid of a useless thing like that!
No way! My motherbought it forme.
It's coming... something evil.
At last! The master of this forest makes his appearance.
Ademon or an apparition?
Quit stalling and show yourself!
T-That's!
Kagome, that demon is!
Yes, it's Gatenmaru.
Oh? You know Gatenmaru?
He's the bane of my tribe.
I hearhe banded togetherwith lowly humans,
then got himself killed by a half-demon.
Now that's a sharp sword.
That half-demon... was me.
That was such a stupid ending to the fight.
Why? The smell of demon blood?
You pesky moth!
If you wanna avenge Gatenmaru's death, I'll gladly take you on!
Avenge?
Whateverfor? He deserved to die!
I could care less about him.
Whatever!
I hate moth demons like you and him!
Inuyasha!
W-What?!
What is this?!
I was careless!
It won't come off!
It's entering my body!
My power...
Damn!
Kagome!
Kagome!
Tetsusaiga isn't working!
It's so uncouth to suck out human blood...
These days, my tribe likes to devour
the heart and soul, shaking in fear and despair.
Dammit!
Miroku!
Hey! Don't be so weak! Hey Miroku!
Sango!
Hang in there!
Whateveryou shout, they cannot hear anymore.
Shippo!
Hey! Answerme!
Shippo!
By morning, a part of me shall take hold of theirhearts and bodies.
Wind Scar!
Shall I test it?
It's useless!
The only way to break this curse is to defeat him!
Now then...
I shall create nightmares foryou...
And you shall pour out your ultimate fear and despairforme!
Hey! K-Kirara!
Are you all right, Kohaku?
If Kirara can handle him like that,
maybe it's too early forhim to face battle.
No such thing, Father.
Kohaku is very skilled with his sickle and chain.
If you say so...
He'll be fine!
And if anything should happen, I'll be with him.
Kohaku!
K-Kohaku!
S-Sister!
I'm scared...
It's okay. I'm with you!
Kohaku...
How fun! How fun!
Well, Miroku?
Don't you forget all your cares when you're here?
MasterMushin, why isn't my fatherhere?
MasterMushin?
Yourfatherdid not want you to see him part from this life.
Part from this life?
By now...
Father!
F-Father...
Look, Pa!
See?
So many acorns.
What's the matter, Sota?
Buyo went in here.
This place is creepy.
It's too late to say that.
Sis!
This miasma...
No! No way!
Sota, run! Hurry!
Sota! Snap out of it!
What's the matter, Kagome?
What's all the fuss?
Don't come!
Suffer!
Beyond that suffering awaits unfathomable despair.
I shall get an ample taste of yourfear and hopelessness.
What'd you do to those guys?!
Just letting them dream.
Dream?!
Humans and demons alike...
all have fears that they suppress deep down in theirhearts
which dreams can release.
We feed on that.
You bastard!
Release Kagome and the others now!
Ahalf-demon!
I can see yourfear so clearly.
What?!
Without your comrades,
you're so lonely, you can't bearit.
Shaddup!
I can fight alone!
However...
ljust don't like you making my friends yourfodder!
All talk.
The unbearable fear of being alone...
I shall devourit!
Shaddup! Take this!
Wind Scar!
He's the one who's all talk.
Think you won?
What?!
Even if you destroy me,
I'll devourtheir souls
and with theirbodies... I shall grow another self.
And that will spell YOURend!
Being devoured by your formerfriends...
that is the fate that awaits you.
And at that moment,
you will be truly released from the fear of loneliness.
The cocoon won't disappear...
What can I do?!
Just what?!
Dammit!
Why you...!
Kagome!
Shippo!
Miroku! Sango!
Kohaku!
Sis! Rejoice forme!
I did it!
I exterminated demons all by myself!
Exterminated demons?
You!
Fatherwill praise me, won't he?
Sister!
Kohaku!
It's yourfault, Sis.
You didn't praise me.
MasterMushin! Let me go!
Please let me go!
Miroku!
Your Wind Tunnel has reached its limit.
Don'tgo anywhere!
I'll find Naraku!
One more step...
Miroku, what's the matter?
Don't come near!
Miroku?
Miroku!
Don't come!
l-Impossible!
It's notexposed!
Monk... did you want so much to be saved?
At the expense of yourfriends' lives?
It's all yourdoing!
Cursing my grandfather with the Wind Tunnel...
Help!
Oh... I've been dreaming.
What's the matter, Kagome?
It's unlike you to be dozing off.
You were sleeping so soundly.
You've been cramming too hard.
No such thing...
This can't be!
Everyone, run!
It's dangerous to stay here!
Damn! Blades of Blood!
Kagome!
Kagome!
Is that all there is to yourpowers?!
Was it so weak that a mere dream could devourit?!
I misjudged you!
If you're gonna give up so easily,
I'll defeat Naraku alone!
Don't come crying later!
Wake up!
Don't let a moth demon eat yourheart!
Kagome!
You're not a weak girl like that!
Tell me...
Tell me...
To Sit!
Kohaku! Forgive me!
I must kill you, oryou can't return to me.
Why?
Why is that, Sis?
I'll kill you, then kill myself.
This is the only way to get you back from Naraku!
I'm sorry, Kohaku!
Don't kill Kohaku.
We mustget him back alive!
But... with me around...
It only causes everyone trouble.
Quit rambling!
It's betterto stay together!
You're good at fighting.
Inuyasha!
What're you afraid of!?
Inuyasha!
If you expose that hand once more, I'll cut it off!
Don't you want to defeat Naraku and break the curse of the Wind Tunnel?!
This is no place to be wasting time!
You're absolutely right, Inuyasha.
Hang in there, Shippo!
Fox fire!
All right!
Hey Shippo, you've been trying hard.
Yeah!
Kagome!
Inuyasha!
You smell nice.
What a thing to say at a time like this...
Run, Inuyasha!
You can't win in your human form.
Fool!
As if I'd go without you!
I'll...
That's right.
I have Inuyasha.
As long as I'm with Inuyasha...
As long as I'm with everyone...
I can overcome any adversity!
Guys! Atta way, everyone!
That's what MYfriends are made of!
Inuyasha!
Hey!
We're leaving this forest now!
Overthere!
Take this!
Wind Scar!
The forest disappeared.
So it was all an illusion created by Garamaru.
We wasted so much time because of him.
I'll say!
Uh-huh...
But y'know...
Without me around, you guys are nothing!
What? Any complaints.
Well, that's exactly true.
At least today, we'll let itgo.
What a way to put it!
Nevermind, Inuyasha. Everyone acknowledges what you did.
No, I DO mind!
If you really believe I saved you, at least say, thank you.
Well then, Kagome, as ourrepresentative, please say a word.
All right.
What?!
Tell me... to SIT!
Inuyasha...
Th-ank you!
Whoa... it wasn't sit.
Well now, shall we proceed?
Yes.
I'm hungry.
Hey! Hey Kagome! What'd you just say?
Say it once more!
Not anymore!
C'mon! Say it!
Such a bother!
What?! Kagome!
Say it!
Sit!
Afterlosing my father, I had continued my training.
Powdery snow fell steadily
and my body sank deeperand deeper into the ground.
But there was someone who saved me.
That was his encounterwith Koyuki seven years ago?
She resembles that woman of my memories.
Did yourtears freeze into snow?
Next on Inuyasha: The Snow from Seven Years Past
Wait, she's not human!
