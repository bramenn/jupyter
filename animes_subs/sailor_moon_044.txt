Endymion... Mother... Usagi has learned everything.
Kunzite! You won't always get your way in this world!
In the name of the moon, Sailor Moon will punish you!
Gomen ne sunao ja nakute yume no naka nara ieru
Shikou kairo wa short sunzen ima sugu aitai yo
Nakitakunaru you na moonlight denwa mo dekinai midnight
Datte junjou dou shiyou heart wa mangekyou
Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare
Nando mo meguriau
Seiza no matataki kazoe uranau koi no yukue
Onaji kuni ni umareta no miracle romance
Shinjite iru no miracle romance
Tuxedo Mask, where are you?
Usagi, wake up! Big news!
Tuxedo Mask, I love you!
Usagi, Sailor Venus and Artemis found the entrance
that leads to the Dark Kingdom's hideout!
What did you say?!
Usagi's Awakening! A Message From the Distant Past
I finally found it!
Good work, Sailor Venus!
Here we go!
Is this...
Let's take a look!
Energy?!
but preparations to receive you are not ready yet.
So I will take you somewhere more fun.
Give me a break!
Supreme
Thunder!
Sailor Moon!
If you quietly hand over the Silver Crystal,
I will let you live!
I'm thinking the same, Kunzite!
If you tell me what you've done with Tuxedo Mask,
I won't punish you!
What impudence!
I will send you to the chaotic world of multiple dimensions!
Chaotic world of multiple dimensions?
It may be the primitive era in Africa when dinosaurs roamed.
Or it could be the era in Europe
when fierce wars broke out.
I don't wanna be sent to a messed-up world like that!
The Silver Crystal will be mine!
Damn!
Where are we?
These are the ruins of Silver Millennium,
the land of gods that once attained the pinnacle of glory.
Silver Millennium?
Who are...
I am here to bring you a message from the distant past.
I am the incarnation of the Moon Goddess, Serene.
I am the Queen of Silver Millennium, Queen Serenity.
I am your mother.
What?! You're my mom?!
What do you mean by that?
I revived Luna and Artemis from their cold sleep,
had them make contact with you
and watched over all of you.
We are long-living life forms born on the moon.
Our mission is to protect the sacred will passed down to us
on the moon, the legendary Silver Crystal,
and to watch over and aid
the progression of Earth's evolution.
Remember, Serenity...
of the time when you were living as the princess of the moon.
Serenity, you adored the green trees and wind
of the beautiful blue Earth, and often gazed up at it.
Then you found love.
Princess Serenity!
Prince Endymion!
Please pardon me for being late to the ball.
I have been waiting for you.
Something terrible has happened.
What?
Most of us on Earth have been brainwashed by Beryl.
Beryl?
Beryl has been possessed by an evil energy called Metalia.
And now, she is taking advantage of
the humans' yearning for the longevity of your people,
and getting ready to attack the moon!
Who's there?!
At the ball...
Endymion...
Where did everyone else go?!
Even if it's only us,
we have to find the Dark Kingdom's hideout!
What is this place?!
The North Pole?!
Princess, may I?
Endymion.
There is no doubt that a bitter war is about to break out
between your people and us Earth people.
I will be your future enemy,
so it would be bad for my identity to be known now.
So, please pardon my appearance.
You will be my enemy?
Metalia is not a human being. She is a mass of evil energy.
Beryl is a witch.
By using the power of Metalia,
she is trying to conquer the moon and Earth.
If we do nothing, this moon will be destroyed.
We must not waste a moment in obliterating Metalia,
who possesses an enormous amount of evil energy,
and crushing Beryl's ambitions!
I would like your help in this, Serenity.
Will you believe what I just told you?
Yes.
Serenity...
Endymion...
It's terrible! It's terrible!
The people of Earth are attacking us!
Bubble
Spray!
Fire
Soul!
Supreme
Thunder!
Crescent Beam!
Starting today, I will rule both Earth and the moon!
I will not allow anyone to defy me!
Our beloved Metalia, this is the birth of our Dark Kingdom!
So, you are Princess Serenity?
I will destroy that pretty face of yours!
Beryl, I will not forgive you
if you lay even a single finger on the princess!
Endymion!
Why do you protect the princess of the moon?
You are the prince of Earth.
If you just marry me,
you could be king of both the moon and Earth!
Beryl, you are being misguided by Metalia,
who possesses evil energy.
Wake up! Rid yourself of the evil mind!
Shut up! I will kill you, too!
Endymion!
Serenity!
Endymion!
Stay back!
Serenity!
Serenity!
Princess Serenity...
She's dead! The Moon Princess is dead!
Serenity...
Queen Serenity, if you use the Silver Crystal, your life...
My life is nothing compared to peace on the moon and Earth.
Moon Healing Escalation!
What?!
Lady Metalia!
Lady Metalia!
Artemis, hang in there!
I'm fine. What about you, Luna?
No, I'm fine. I can't die until we find their hideout!
This is...
We've found it!
Finally, we've found the entrance to the Dark Kingdom's hideout!
We need to tell everyone right away!
But it is already too late.
Luna, Artemis...
Yes.
The Silver Crystal can be used for peace
if it is used with the energy of a good heart.
But, if it is used with the energy of an evil heart,
it will become a terrible weapon.
Queen Serenity!
I have been able to seal Metalia away with the Silver Crystal,
but there is no knowing when she might be revived again.
And this Crescent Moon Wand
can only be used by a descendant of this kingdom.
If Metalia should return to life again in the future,
give this to Princess Serenity and protect the peaceful world.
Yes, my lady.
Princess Serenity and all of our sailor warriors,
may your love be fulfilled in the future on Earth.
In the future on Earth...
Queen Serenity!
We...
traveled...
into the past.
Now, we know why we're Sailor Warriors.
Yes.
Mother...
Help!
Luna!
Artemis! Luna!
Artemis!
Sailor...
I won't let you hurt them!
Sailor Moon?! It can't be!
I sent you to the chaotic world of multiple dimensions!
You won't always get your way in this world!
Thanks to you, we've recovered our past memories!
So, we will...
thank you now!
Shut up!
Don't give me that sass! You're still wet behind the ears!
Give back Tuxedo Mask... no, Endymion!
I won't mind returning him to you
if you quietly hand over the Silver Crystal.
Sailor Moon!
You're more sinister than I imagined!
I'll never forgive you!
We are inside my own space.
Will your attacks still work against me, I wonder?
Everyone, we have to combine our powers!
Protect Sailor Moon!
Venus Power!
Mercury Power!
Mars Power!
Jupiter Power!
Everyone!
Even if you repaid us with nicer haute couture dresses,
I would never forgive you for cutting up a girl's clothes!
In the name of the moon, I will punish you!
Moon Healing Escalation!
I am one of the Great Four of the Dark Kingdom, Kunzite!
On my pride, I will not yell, Refresh!
What?!
Impossible!
With my own weapon...
Zoisite, guide me to the world where your soul is drifting!
Sailor Moon, that was tremendous power.
She's different than usual.
Luna, please hang in there.
Usagi... No, Sailor Moon...
No, Serenity, the Dark Kingdom's hideout
is at D-Point in the North Pole.
If you don't hurry, the sunspot will expand!
We have no choice but to launch a surprise attack!
Okay! We'll march into the Dark Kingdom right away!
Right, everyone?!
Yes!
In the name of the moon,
we will punish you!
