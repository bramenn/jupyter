Hey!
( !)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
All right! I'll say it!
You are my best, best friend!
(Fly!) When I joke around a bit,
(Shine!) You joke around more in response.
(La La La) Nothing is better than this!
(Why!) Even if something bad happens,
(Fine!) I immediately forget about it!
(La La La)
Always keep it going!
Being together 24 hours a day isn't a problem.
Just like twins, or a parent and child, or clone cyborgs.
Then isn't there no reason to clear your eyes?
Those are completely, completely different issues.
(Fight!) Even when I get in a fight with you,
(Down!) even when I get really down,
(Shy!) even when I feel like I want to be alone,
before I realise it, you're right there; we'll be together even in death!
I wonder why it is.
I want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
time goes 100 times faster!
It's fun, isn't it?
It's way too fun!
As expected of my best friend!
What is it?
The synchro is amazing!
Always making an uproar,
bothering the neighbours a lot.
What time is it now?
And then yo de le hi hoo!
I don't get it at all!
So re doh si la!
It's better than I imagined, the absolute best!
Even if I say this and that, we're still friends. (Hooray!)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
Cha Cha La Cha La Cha Cha!
I didn't know
That the sky was this blue
The sky we all walk beneath, holding hands
And all look up at
The sky is very blue
The sky has taught me
To have a big heart
To never let go of your friend's hand
I didn't know
That the sky was this blue
I wonder why it makes me sad
I look up at the sky by myself
The sky is amazingly blue
The sky told me
With the song of the clouds, which won't lose to the wind
Not to cry, even if you are alone

Shinonome Institute
I'm going home.

Word Of The Day
Narration: Horie Yui
Good morning!
I'm first!
Stag beetle...
What are you doing, Aioi?
Why are you here so early in the morning?!
I'm on duty today.
Oh, how about you help me take out the trash?
Sensei, please don't tell anyone!
We'll see about that.
You're horrible!
That was close!
Mio.
Hm?
I tried making jam yesterday.
Do you want to taste it?
What's with this so suddenly?
Well, I used up the last of your marmalade, so...
Oh, that...
But does the fact that you're making jam...
Don't make fun of me!
Well, just try guessing what type of jam it is.
Oh, sure.
Well, here goes.
Awful!
Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful!
It's so bad that I don't know what's going on any more!
Here, Mio,
have some Russian tea!
It's hot!
Hot! Hot!
It's hot, and now that I think about it, it's awful, too!
Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful!
Here, Mio!
Cool your tongue off with some jam!
Awful!
Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful!
Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful!
Water!
Water, water, water!
Water, water, water!
Water, water, water!
Water, water, water!
Water, water, water!
Water, water, water!
Water, water, water!
Water, water, water!
Water!
Milk!
Milk!
Milk!
Milk, milk, milk!
Oh, Mio, I put the leftover jam in there.
What's with this?
This unmatched awful taste?!
Still, it's awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful!
Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful!
Hey, Mio, are you all right?
All right?
Am I all right?!
There's no way I'm all right!
It was so bad,
I had a strange vision of my life flashing before my eyes!
I thought it wasn't good,
but I didn't think it would be that bad.
Why would you intentionally make something awful?!
I thought it would be interesting.
Oh, you idiot sister...
Well, whatever.
So, what type of jam do you think it is?
Like I would know!
You probably put in a rotten fish!
Close!
fermented fish jam!
That stinks!
That was my first and last fermented fish anniversary.
Mako-chan!
Dad's going to be late today,
so I'm ordering some delivery.
Is there anything you want?
There's a giant mess...
He never cleans no matter how many times I ask.
Maybe I should scold him properly...
Is this what I think it is?
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
You startled me!
I told you not to come in without my permission!
Next time you come in, it's that!
It's going to be that!
I'm sorry.
That's right.
I really need to scold him today.
Hey!
I told you not to barge in like that!
Oh, sorry.
And why are you trying to clean my room?
It's because you never clean it yourself!
Everything is perfect where it is!
Just stop coming into my room!
Mako-chan!
Seriously, stop coming into my room!
I think you're still too young for this kind of thing!
I think you're still too young for this kind of thing!
I think you're still too young for this kind of thing!
You...
How did you get...
What is that?
I don't get it.
It's not even mine!
Well, I found it in your room!
What?
I've never seen that before.
Besides, when did we decide this is my room?!
It's not even certain this is my room!
Either way, I think you're too young for this!
You shouldn't have these things!
I have no clue what you're talking about!
And you're not even making any sense!
Well, I'm going to throw this out, then!
That belongs to the club president!
Huh?
I don't think it's polite to throw away other people's belongings!
I'm sorry!
I kinda peeked a little, and it's sort of amazing...
I don't think you should be looking at these things yet...
You'll become a delinquent.
I got it!
I won't look at it, so stop coming into my room!
God, this is horrible.
What does Takasaki-sensei see in her?
Mako-chan, are you mad?
Can't you at least knock?!
Well, I just thought you might be angry...
I'm not mad!
See? You are mad...
I'm not mad!
I'm not mad, so please get out of my room!
Next time you don't knock,
It's definitely going to be that!
It honestly will!
I want to live alone already...
I screwed up today...
He claims his room is cleaned up as it is,
and that book wasn't Mako-chan's...
But lately, everyone at school has had lax discipline.
Just like at school, I need to keep order at home!
I am the student advisor!
Oh, I completely forgot!
Mako-chan, I'm going to order delivery for -
How many times do I have to tell you?!
Um, about the future aspirations section...
Do you have any sort of dream or goal?
Well, yes...
Well...
I would like to be on TV once in my lifetime!
Um, not in that kind of way.
I apologise.
My question must not have been clear.
Is there a certain job or career you'd like?
Well, yes, let's see...
Um...
I would like to become a teacher like Sakurai-sensei!
Like me?
Oh...
Um...
This is everyone's effort...
It's up to you now, Nakamura!
This is our last college run!
Retire!
Tokisadame College has retired!
Nano-chan, Nano-chan.
Yes, what is it?
On our way home, we met Professor,
and ended up getting bitten by dogs and stuff.
Sounds like you went through some trouble.
Please tell Professor we'll drop by again soon.
All right.
Sensei, please become our advisor!
Some things I just won't do!
No way!
You gave a green light last time!
When did I ever say that?
I can't believe this...
You said that if I beat you, you'll become our advisor!
Was it from then?
Hold on!
We called it a draw due to an injury that time!
Geez, I'm going to tell everyone about your feelings for my sister!
Where's the club room?
It's this way!
All right!
Today will be the day where the Go Soccer Club will really begin!
Yeah!
President!
Huh?
S-Sorry for barging in!
Anyway, I found a teacher to be the advisor for -
Hey, wait!
Why are you running away?
Takasaki-sensei!
They left...
I was going to recruit more members...
Without Sakurai, I can't properly explain this club...
Oh well.
This is my club.
I'm nervous...
Why are you nervous?
Well, you're on your way to confess your feelings...
That's right!
That punk spirit in this school of peace.
Mohawks are just irresistible!
Well, not irresistible, but definitely unique.
Whoa!
Sensei!
Hold on, please!
Hey, Takasaki-sensei...
Why did you run away?
I haven't played such a passionate game of Go Soccer for so long!
I can't think of anyone more appropriate than you for our advisor!
I'm sorry...
But you see, I have some... things.
Well... things like that...
You see... and such...
You even came to the club room with me!
I have no choice.
Sensei.
After looking at this, can you still say things like that?
You!
This is...
Indeed.
It's a picture of my sister in her high school days.
Well, sensei, what are you going to do?
Will you become our advisor in exchange for this photograph?
I want it!
I want it so much...
But it feels like something important within me would crumble if I accepted this!
Sakurai...
Yes.
Sorry, but...
This seems like a great deal to me!
What am I doing?!
Awesome!
So you'll become our advisor?
I'm the worst...
Having such behaviour as a teacher...
However, I may be a teacher, but I'm still a hungry wolf!
Necessity has no law!
Listen up, Sakurai!
If we're doing this, we're going all out!
All right?!
Yes!
All right, the Go Soccer Club begins today!
I'm going to go all out starting tomorrow!
All right!
It's here.
Oh, I see.
Hey!
Yes?
Is that Nakanojou guy here?
Oh, yes.
Nakanojou-kun!
Nakanojou-kun, someone's calling you.
Yes, what can I do for you?
Not appealing at all...
Dad, will you go look for me?
Got it.
How was it?
Which one?
The train will briefly stop here.
Minakami-san, why are you here?
I came to play.
Whoa, thank you for bringing all of these snacks.
Ah!
It's the person who tried to have her dogs bite me!
Huh?
It's definitely her!
Well, I'm going to go make some tea.
Why did you come here?
Here.
What is that?
Yamantaka.
I don't want it.
But it's cool.
It's not cool at all.
This is pretty neat.
What is that?
A 36-room house.
That's not neat at all.
No baths, toilets or windows.
Not neat at all.
What are you drawing?
I'm not telling.
Here.
It's a blue shark.
That's cool!
You can have it!
Yay!
Hey, try drawing a different shark!
Sure.
Draw a shark that's smiling!
Sure.
Will you trade with mine?
Sure.
Sorry for the wai -
Huh?
Professor, did Minakami-san go home?
Yeah, but I told her to come back to draw more pictures.
I see.
I wonder why she came over.
It really is something.
I'm a graduation photo!
When someone says Whoa, that's cute! about a picture,
doesn't that make you think So, I'm not cute now?
Next time on Nichijou: Episode 24.
Look forward to it!
