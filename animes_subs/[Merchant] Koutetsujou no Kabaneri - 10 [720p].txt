The strong survive...
He said that's the way the world worked.
I can't accept that.
He should be taken down.
Just you wait, Biba
Everyone in red armbands head to the back.
Traitor.
Sorry, my policy is to follow the guy with the biggest guns.
Yukina-san.
This is for Ikoma.
He's with them now.
It makes me sick
Do you think he really is?
Probably.
Ikoma.
Here.
Hold up, Takumi.
You're supposed to go over there.
Please, I beg that you spare my wife.
I will give enough blood for the both of us instead.
What did you say, sir?
That's fine with me.
No.
Where's the fun... in that deal?
Then I will give enough for three No, four!
Very well.
You have a deal.
Thank you.
Take the blood.
Yes, sir.
Warabi, I'm tired of you picking on the weak.
How could you do that?!
Let go of me!
Judging from your weight...
Would you like to make a deal?
Here.
When are you going to do it, Ikoma?
I can't wait anymore.
Hey, you're in the way.
Hey, Ikoma!
Tomorrow night.
We'll do it when they come to take blood.
Well, let's hear your answer, then.
With your uncle being Elder Makino...
I am to get them to open the gates to Diamond Citadel...
If you will guarantee me the safety of my people...
That is a wise decision.
But what do you plan to do after you meet with your father?
Ten years ago...
I know.
You were the commander despite being only 12 years old.
When we landed in Kyushu...
We established several bases...
However, suddenly...
We were...
My father was behind everything.
I have to punish my father with my own hands.
You want to take over Master Fortress's engine room?
The engine room is the heart of a Railfort.
If we can control it...
He will probably agree to release Ayame-sama and Nameless as well.
But the engine room is located in the front car.
How are we supposed to make it that far?
One of them...
It's most likely to carry the blood to the front car where the Corpses are.
Once a day during the night, he brings his keys.
We're going to steal them.
It seems we have no other choice.
The people won't be able to keep this up
Biba plans to destroy Diamond Citadel.
After we cross the Great Sea Harbor Bridge...
I'm worried about Ayame-sama as well.
If something were to happen,
I wouldn't be able to face Kurusu when he returns.
You're right.
We'll gather whatever we can use as weapons.
Let's go.
Yes, sir.
You think Nameless -chan will come back?
It doesn't matter.
I'm bringing her back whether she wants to come or not.
That's what I've decided.
Is Nameless -chan a lot like Hatsune-chan?
My sister?
Not even a little bit.
Please don't compare her to that brute.
They might be about the same height, but that's all.
I see.
It's just...
Someone?
Yeah.
Go save her this time. You'd better not run.
I wonder who...
Maybe God?
No.
It's coming from you.
I see. You might be right.
I recently finally figured out how you think.
Only now?
Then do you know how I think?
No, but you figured it out.
Because you're simple.
What the hell?
Sorry, I take it back
Are we really going to continue our plan without Soue-sama?
We have no other choice.
Don't play dumb!
You're the ones who turned Fireless in to that hybrid colony, right?
Why did you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Aren't you Tasuke?
What happened to you?!
Don't move!
Okay, just keep applying pressure on it with gauze.
Brother!
You're taking blood from the people on the Iron Fortress?
Why are you doing that?
Brother!
I wonder, what do you think the Corpses are... Nameless?
They suddenly appeared one day...
The Corpses are our enemy.
They need to be destroyed.
But... thanks to them...
I thought you were going to go meet with your father in Diamond Citadel.
I see.
Do you fear me... Nameless?
Young Master...
No problem.
Nameless.
I see that you like the people of Iron Fortress.
It must have been a good journey for you.
Okay.
I will send notice that they shall not be harmed as long as they remain peaceful.
Thank you, brother!
Does she require repairs?
Very serious repairs.
What else should we review?
If we get Takumi to do number three...
I can offer my support on that.
Thank you.
Well then, please do.
All right!
Okay.
Ikoma, here!
Line up.
Today we're collecting from the blue armbands.
If you want blood so badly...
What did you say, you bastard?!
Corpseless?!
Takumi, go!
Everybody down!
Now!
What's going on?
Hey, stop it, idiot!
Let me explain!
There's nothing to explain!
Wait, Takumi!
Ikoma?!
It was all an act!
Sukari was feeding me information on the Master Fortress!
We were using bamboo pipes to pass on messages.
No way...
What the hell, so you were tricking us?!
Not exactly, but...
He's a traitor, isn't he?
You should just shoot.
Oh, how kind of you.
Kibito-san, I'll take care of him!
You bastard.
I let you live because they said a male Corpseless is rare!
Kurusu and Nameless are faster!
Die, you monster!
Don't you call him a monster!
What the hell is that face for?!
Is it really that funny that I'd save the day?!
Well, yes.
What?!
Bastards, how did you...?!
Understood.
I will take care of it.
Can you handle this, Nameless?
But...
If you can't...
The curse will likely spread even further throughout your body.
I don't wish to see that.
Be strong, Nameless.
You don't want to end up like your mother, do you?
I'm sorry...
I can't do it.
I want...
I want to be able to eat rice every day in a world without the Corpses!
So...
I'm sorry... brother.
I see.
What?
Let go of me!
Capture her!
Stop fight
I made the right decision lowering your blood dosage.
Tranquilize her.
Yes!
No!
Let me go!
Everyone's here, aren't they?
I want to leave!
Ikoma!
Now you will be able to hear my voice more clearly.
Go on ahead, Ikoma!
This will take too long!
Okay.
Let's hurry up and finish this so we can eat!
With Nameless -chan and Ayame-sama, of course!
Yeah, I agree!
What?
Why?
What are you doing, Ikoma?!
They're going to come if you don't hurry!
Damn it!
That didn't work.
We'll go around the outside!
What is it?!
It won't open!
What?!
Biba!
Ikoma...
We will cross the Great Sea Harbor Bridge tomorrow.
I predicted that if you were to start a revolt, this would be the time.
So I had the keys switched.
Well done noticing the keys...
You fail, Ikoma.
Ikoma...
Takumi?!
I did it this time...
That day you turned into a Corpseless and got shot...
But I finally... did
Tell me how you feel.
Tell me how it feels to lose your friend, Ikoma.
Depending on your answer, I may spare you and make you one of us.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong...!
Why did you do this?!
Are you finished, sir?
Yes.
You'll pay... for killing Takumi!
You'll pay!
Bring her here.
I want you to kill him.
Nameless?
Hey...
What did they do to you?
Well done.
That is...
Are you human or a Corpse?!
I'm neither!
I'm a Corpseless!
I will remember that day
Losing myself
In steam
Countless mistakes are made
When I can't see anything ahead
You said
Ask your own burning blood
Answer my beat
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress
Stand up
And slam everything onto the ground
My soul is devoted to my friend
Burn your life
Change the world
Even if the stars
That connect you make a sound
There are just dreams in the same rain
And lights are dried up
I am tired of getting answers
By mimicking others
Dawn without the sun
And broken morning
Smashed cry and dream The ideal only has its doors
City is uplifted and drown in noise
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder
To hush silence
Chapter Ten
The Attacking Weak
