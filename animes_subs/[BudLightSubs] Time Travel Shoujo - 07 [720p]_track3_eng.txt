Shiiwaku, manabi... Huh? Fu-re? Re-re?
What was this one again?
Hang on a minute...
Characters you don't have to use the kun reading for even if grammatically necessary.
What does that mean?!
You're not supposed to read them?!
Thanks for helping while you're studying for your test.
Don't worry.
You gotta refresh yourself sometimes. My mind was going blank.
Look how hard you're working!
I did really bad on my midterms, so I at least want to work hard for the finals.
Really? That's a good attitude to have.
If there's anything you don't understand, feel free to ask Shun.
I'm sure he can teach you a lot.
Huh? Wh-Why are you bringing up Shun?
He's so busy, I doubt he'd have time to help me anyway.
Oh, really?
It seems like you two and Waka have all been studying together a lot lately.
Waka's mother told me all about it.
Huh?!
Th-That was... Waka's idea...
Shun's being very considerate.
I really do love him.
Y-You love him?
Episode 7 Morse's Inspiration
Ayuhara! Ichikawa! Imai! Episode 7 Morse's Inspiration
Yeah! Eighty percent!
Ichikawa, an 80 is nothing to yell about.
Hayase!
Sorry!
Himuro!
Fujita!
Matsuyama!
Mizuki!
She received the only perfect score in the class today.
Minami!
Murakami!
Maybe I'm just not any good at school.
Welco-
I just came here as a customer today.
Don't worry.
On your favorites menu,
it said you have a special chiffon cake.
I'm terribly sorry.
We sold out of the Jersey Milk Chiffon Cake this morning.
I see. What a shame.
I was hoping to take one back for a client.
A client?
Why would you...
The fund we manage for her took a slight loss.
I was hoping to take it as an apology.
You, directly, Mr. Mikage?
I'm grateful to have such a beautiful woman remember my name.
She's a sixty-year-old industrialist.
She's famous for her gourmet palate.
Consideration is more important when we fail
than when business is going well.
A woman with a gourmet palate?
In that case, what about our six types of pudding, made with organic vegetables?
They're very popular with women
who are concerned about ingredients, flavor, and calories.
Oh?
I'll take that pudding, then.
Thank you!
You don't have to get so upset.
It's just the usual, right?
But I really studied hard this time.
Mari. What's wrong?
She got her usual awful score on our last test.
Waka! You don't have to put it that way!
Really?
B-Brother, what are you doing?
I found Dr. Hayase's thesis, so I was reading it.
Regularity in Dimensional Distortions Caused by Changes in Electromagnetic Fields?
I think this is the basis for the machine he created.
It's written in Japanese, but I can barely understand it.
Yeah... the vocabulary is too specialized for me to understand.
Shun is so amazing.
He can understand it just by looking at it...
I don't actually understand it.
That's why I was looking at it.
If you keep looking at things you don't understand, and keep thinking,
some day, it might all come together.
Really?
So? What's with the strings of letters and numbers?
I believe this is the record of the armillary compass's destinations.
I think AM1 may be the doctor, and AM2 could be Mari.
Huh? Then we know the last place Papa went to?
Hmm...
If I could grasp the system behind these numbers and letters...
That's something you don't understand yet, huh?
I'm afraid not.
I see.
Don't get so depressed. We'll figure it out soon.
Right, Brother?
Yes, that's right.
Well, then... let's get started!
For now, I believe if you touch any picture that's Morse or later,
you'll travel to the past.
Right.
The Year 1825 (What is Now) New Haven, America‚Äù
So cold!
Huh?
Oh... um...
Oh, are you the scientist, Mr. Morse?
I'm not a scientist, but my name is Morse.
Who are you?
I'm Mari. Mari Hayase.
That's not what I meant.
You just came from a burst of light.
Oh, well...
Why are you crying, anyway?
My wife died last week.
When it happened,
I was off painting a portrait of Marquis de Lafayette...
A portrait? Mr. Morse, are you a painter?
Yes.
Huh? What's going on?
Mari, until he invented Morse Code,
it seems he was a skilled painter who gave lectures at universities.
But in 1825,
his wife died, and the news didn't reach him at his place of work in time,
so he missed her funeral.
Brother...
This place on the monitor... is it not synced with the book?
And these numbers here...
It really looks like the history of AM1, doesn't it?
What is this?
Just who are you talking to?
Oh, um...
Mari, there's something I want to test.
Huh? What is it?
I'm going to rewrite the coordinates of your armillary compass to match the doctor's.
What will happen then?
I think it will take you to when the doctor met Mr. Morse.
I understand. Try it!
Matching up coordinates with AM2.
Battery remaining. Good.
How's Mari doing?
Wait a minute!
She's fine. No change!
Good. I don't think I'm missing anything.
Mari, let's go.
O-Okay!
Mr. Morse! You're going to make an invention that will change humanity!
So don't be sad forever!
Sh-She disappeared?!
What happened just now?
The Year 1832, on the Atlantic Ocean
That hurt...
-Aren't you... that girl? -Mr. Morse!
I thought you were an angel or something.
I started thinking about a lot of things after that.
But I'm just an humble painter, after all.
I don't think I could create an incredible invention like you talked about.
People with no talent,
no matter how hard they work, will never accomplish anything great.
But...
Maybe I'm just not any good at school.
Luckily, I was blessed with artistic talent.
Thanks to that, I can live a decent life.
It's amazing that you can make such pretty pictures with only blip-blops...
Blip-blops?
Oh, dots?
Thank you. I am a professional, after all.
Yes! I think that went well.
Yes. Thank goodness.
It's from Futa!
What could it say?!
What's going on with you?
Brother, you handle the rest!
H-Hey!
It's the ocean!
This ship is going from Europe to America.
Then this is the Atlantic Ocean?
Yes.
Now, now, everyone! Your attention, please!
I have here a piece of copper wire.
And if I wind it around the iron,
then bring it close to the nails...
However!
If I bring the tip of the copper wire to this battery,
and run electricity through it...
How mysterious!
All I did was wrap iron with copper wire!
And it becomes a magnet that attracts one nail after another!
And when I detach it from the battery...
Wow! Papa!
Oh! Mari! You came at the right time.
Help me out!
Huh? Help you out? W-With what?
Huh? Help you out? W-With what?
Never mind! Just step over here!
Now, now. The next trick...
When I re-attach it to the battery, it's a magnet again!
When it attaches, they stick!
When I take it off, they release!
This is the newest invention of science, the electromagnet!
Mama! I want to do that, too!
You want to try? Step on up!
It worked!
Amazing, isn't it?
Now, these electromagnetic kits sell for just one dollar if you buy now!
Perfect for a child's education!
Will it make them a doctor or a minister?
You're selling them?
What are you doing, Mari? Sell them! Sell them!
Huh? Me?
Mama, buy one!
Thanks for your business!
No, we really can't.
Stop that. And give it back.
Huh? No, ma'am! Don't be like that!
Huh? Everyone? W-Wait!
Could I buy one?
Huh?
S-Sure.
Thank you for your business.
No matter how far away the line stretches,
it will attract or release the nails just the same, right?
Yes, of course!
An electromagnet, huh?
Magnificent!
Mari. Thanks to you, I feel like I've been able to see something I couldn't see before.
Thank you.
If I can make a picture with dots, I'm sure I can make words with dots.
In that moment, Morse realized that by turning an electromagnet on and off,
he could create words by combining dots and dashes.
In other words, long and short signals.
This invention revolutionized the speed of communication,
which had previously been done with messenger pigeons and semaphores.
Electric signals opened the way to long-range communication for the first time.
He came upon the idea seven years after his wife's death.
And twelve years after that, on May 24th, 1844,
Morse successfully sent the famous words, What hath God wrought,
from Washington to Baltimore.
That's your father, right, Mari?
Erk!
W-Well, I...
I am an American doctor and scientist, Charles Thomas Jackson!
Ch-Charles?
Well, forget it.
Thank you. You showed me an interesting invention, Mr. Charles Thomas Jackson.
I'm so glad you believed me!
Huh?
Huh?!
Papa... what are you doing here?
Huh? Oh...
On the way back from Europe,
he watched a demonstration of the electromagnet on this ship,
and had the inspiration for Morse Code.
So?
Well...
The man who was supposed to inspire him missed the boat.
Does that make it okay for a time traveler like you to do this?
And how do you know that, anyway?
W-Well... before the voyage, he had a bit too much to drink...
Papa...
How do you know that?
Well... he couldn't hold his liquor the way I expected...
You were drinking with him, huh?
Well, I wasn't expecting him to pass out drunk at two bottles!
That's ridiculous!
You're starting to sound like your mother.
Because I'm her daughter!
Even so, what are you doing here?
The coordinates to Morse in that book should have been for 1825 in New Haven.
Shun rewrote the coordinates in the system.
That's Shun for you!
He's started to figure out how the machine works, has he?
Don't try to change the subject!
Erk!
What are you even doing in the past, Papa?
I'm discovering the secrets of that book.
Huh?
The book... You mean, you didn't make it?
Certainly not!
I could never create anything like that!
Wh-What?!
I was just doing matter transportation experiments,
and that book suddenly transported to me!
It seemed likely that it came from the future. Yes!
Oops, sorry. Looks like it's time.
W-Wait! Papa!
I don't know what caused me to go away for three years.
But I think it's destiny that you got involved with that machine.
Huh?! What's that supposed to mean?!
What is it? Cut to the chase already!
Celebrate! We won the regional preliminaries!
The nationals are up next!
Thanks to you, I can study and play soccer, too!
Thanks a lot!
Our soccer club is in the nationals!
It's a miracle!
Yes. It is delicious.
Excuse me.
We've discovered Akira Hayase's background.
She's the eldest daughter of Renzaburo Miwa, president of the Miwa Concern.
When she was twenty, she moved to France,
and gained experience as a patissiere.
The Miwa Concern...
I see. So she's unlikely to be swayed by money.
By the way, what about the book that appeared during the matter transporting experiments?
It seems to be a book about the history of magnets and electricity.
But that's all we know for now.
I see.
Would you like some, too?
Thank you, sir.
She took them all.
I see.
Shun Mizuki...
In 2025, he developed the Law of Time-Space Abnormality Measurement
that made time travel technology possible.
In 2076, he successfully invented the TSS limiter
which prevented time paradox variations.
Mari...
What's wrong?
I'm such an idiot.
I can't understand anything Papa's thinking.
You're not stupid, Mari.
But... even if I study, my grades don't improve.
I can't understand anything you guys do!
Everyone has lots of things they don't understand.
That's why you need to keep thinking.
Stew over things. Investigate things.
Even then, there are a lot of things you won't understand.
But if you keep thinking, then one day, out of the blue,
everything will come together, and you'll understand.
In physics, we call that phase transformation.
Phase transformation?
Yes.
As water gets colder, there's an instant when it becomes solid ice, right?
Yeah.
And at 100 degrees Celsius, it becomes water vapor.
Yeah.
Even things that, at a glance, seem like they're not changing at all,
if you keep pouring energy into them, in one instant,
they'll suddenly undergo a physical change.
Study and inspiration are the same way.
If you keep thinking, you'll undergo a sudden change?
Yes.
Lots of people saw that exhibition,
but why did only Mr. Morse have the inspiration for the signal?
It must be because
he had been thinking about the long-distance communication code for years.
There's no need to think you don't have any talent
just because you don't see results right away.
Shun!
What? What? What's with this vibe?
You'll be okay, Mari.
Yeah! Thanks, Shun!
Oh-ho! Not bad at all!
Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.
I see you're working hard.
Yeah!
Just because my grades don't go up right away
is no reason to give up, I realized.
I see. That's very good.
Perseverance is important, right?
Yeah!
In physics, it's called phase transformation!
That's what Shun taught me.
Oh? Shun said that?
Huh?
That's my new almond praline cream puff.
Let me know what you think later.
Okay. Thanks.
Okay! Let's work hard!

Just what signal did Mr. Morse come up with after watching Papa's demonstration?
Yeah! I really want to hear about it!
These are the transmitters and receivers used in Morse Code.
Transmitter Iron Electric Current Receiver
Pressing the switch of the transmitter sends electricity to the receiver, Transmitter Iron Electric Current Receiver
and turns the coil into an electromagnet, which attracts the iron. Transmitter Iron Electric Current Receiver
When the electricity is cut off, the power of the spring pulls it away again. Transmitter Iron Electric Current Receiver
Morse thought of using this phenomenon to send signals. Transmitter Iron Electric Current Receiver
Mr. Morse is so smart! Transmitter Iron Electric Current Receiver
