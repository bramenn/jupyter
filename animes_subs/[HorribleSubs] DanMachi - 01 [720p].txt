A long, long time ago, we gods came down to this world
the world of you, our children
seeking excitement.
And we decided that we would
live here with you forever in the lower world.
We decided to seal away our divine power,
and enjoy life with all the hardship and inconvenience that it entails.
Whew.
the power to fight monsters, what we call our blessing.
The children given this power become our servants,
our familia.
In other words,
you are my servant.
You are the only member of the Hestia Familia.
Are you listening, Bell?
Bell?
Hey...
Are you all right?
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Bell Cranel Adventurer
Thanks!
What happened to him?
Is he okay?
He's probably a new adventurer who pushed himself too hard and screwed up.
Oh, so he's just a screwup, huh?
Miss Eina!
Bell!
Please tell me what you know about Miss Aiz Wallenstein!
You know better than that!
Going straight down to the fifth floor?
It's dangerous enough to go into the
dungeon alone instead of finding a party!
I've told you this before.
An adventurer shouldn't be too adventurous!
Yeah...
I'm sorry.
Bell, you're amazingly lucky.
Not many Level 1 adventurers,
who've only been going into the dungeon for two weeks,
would survive a minotaur attack.
Yeah...
Anyway, I'm just glad you're safe.
Be more careful next time, okay?
And try not to run through the streets soaked in blood, okay?
Yeah!
So about that information on Miss Aiz...
What?
Don't tell me you've
fallen in love with Miss Wallenstein, the girl who saved you...
Well, um...
You have, haven't you?
Yeah!
Aiz Wallenstein.
Part of the Loki Familia. Currently Level 5.
She's said to be one of the strongest swordsmen in Orario,
and gods have given her the title Sword Princess.
Even I know that.
I meant more like... What does she like to do?
What's her favorite food?
And, um...
Whether she has a special someone? Is that it?
E-Exactly!
I can't say I've ever heard anybody say that she has.
Really?
But realistically, I think it's not going to be easy.
You're already received the blessing of the goddess Hestia,
and become part of the Hestia Familia, right?
There's a lot of reasons it will be hard for you to get to know a
leader of the Loki Familia.
You know that, right?
Come on, cheer up!
Go and trade in the magic stones you earned today for money.
Okay.
Here.
Here you go.
1200 valis.
Thanks.
Okay, I'll be leaving.
Bell.
Listen, girls like guys who are strong, and can protect them.
So if you keep working hard and get stronger,
she just might like you back.
Yeah!
Thank you, Miss Eina!
I love you!
Isn't that sweet?
Maybe I was a little too nice.
Bell, an adventurer needs to pick up his girls in a dungeon.
You save a weak female adventurer from a hideous monster,
she's grateful, and the two of you get to know each other.
That's the best part of being an adventurer.
It was just like my late grandfather said!
Well, except that it was the other way around.
I have to do my best!
Goddess! I'm back!
You're home early today.
Yes.
I kind of almost got killed in the dungeon today...
Are you okay?
Does it hurt?
If you die it'll be really traumatic for me!
It's okay, Goddess.
I'm the only member of the Hestia Familia.
I wouldn't leave you alone and helpless in the world.
Okay, glad to hear it!
I'm going to choose to believe that, so you'd better not let me down!
Oh, right!
I have a delicious present for you today!
Ta-dah!
Where'd you get those fried potatoes?
You know how I started working at that food stand?
Since more customers started coming, they gave it to me as a reward!
Let's have a fancy party for our dinner.
Bell...
I'm not letting you get any sleep tonight!
Wow, Goddess!
Anyway...
I still can't find anybody else who wants to join my familia.
Maybe it can't be helped, since I'm a goddess nobody's ever heard of.
You get the same blessing no matter
which god you serve, though.
Well, as for me...
I wouldn't mind it being just the two of us for a little longer.
No, no!
It does bother me that I'm making you do all the work alone, though.
Don't worry about it.
You're working too, aren't you?
Tonight you even brought me dinner.
But this is all I can do...
I wish I could at least use my divine power, my Arcanum...
But there's a rule that says you can't use it on the lower world.
I'm sorry I made you contract with such a useless goddess...
What are you saying, Goddess?
Our familia is just getting started!
If we get through this, things are sure to get easier!
Okay?
Bell!
Thank you!
I'm so lucky to have met somebody like you!
Okay, let's upgrade your status and make ourselves better future!
Yes, Goddess!
Bell, you're too idealistic about the dungeon.
You'll never pick up the girls you're looking for in a brutal place like that.
Like this Aiz Wallenstein girl...
If she's that strong and that beautiful,
there'll be other guys after her, too!
She's sure to have a man or two she likes already.
Are you upset for some reason, Goddess?
I most certainly am not!
Is something wrong?
No!
Listen, Bell.
You need to pay more attention to what's around you.
The girls you're looking for might be right in front of you!
In fact, you've already met a wonderful girl
who'll love you and hold you gently!
I'm sure of it.
Have I really?
Well, since she's in the Loki Familia,
there's no way you could marry that Wallenwhatsit girl.
You should forget about that girl,
and look for the happiness that's right in front of you.
You're really mean, Goddess.
My agility's gone up a lot!
Yeah.
Probably because you had that minotaur chasing you around.
And my magic power is still zero, huh?
Am I ever going to be able to use magic?
I don't know that myself.
Goddess!
What's with the line on the page for skills?
Oh, my finger slipped a little.
It's empty, like always.
Of course it is.
I just wish there were some way I could get stronger quickly.
The children in the lower world change so easily.
We gods, on the other hand, are unchanging.
Realis Phrase.
To grow quickly.
As long as his feelings remain, it'll stay in effect.
And the stronger his feelings, the more its effects grow.
Congratulations, Bell.
You finally have a skill.
But it bugs me that it was somebody else that changed you!
I'm off, Goddess.
Stupid Bell...
That was close.
Maybe she was still half-asleep.
What was that?
Um...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you need something?
Um... you dropped this.
A magic stone?
I thought I traded them all in yesterday...
Excuse me. Thank you very much.
You're an adventurer, right?
You're heading into the dungeon this early?
Yes, I guess.
It's not much, but...
I couldn't, though...
I can't take a lunch from somebody I've never met!
And isn't this your breakfast?
Don't worry about it.
There'll be something for me to eat once the pub opens.
B-But...
In exchange...
Make sure you come eat here tonight!
It's a promise!
Is that not okay?
O-Okay...
Thank you.
How long would I have to
keep doing this to catch up to Miss Aiz?
Miss Eina tells me that it's important
to take my time and learn the basics, but...
An item drop?
Lucky me.
There's so many...
Should I run? But...
Please, Bell!
Fight!
I-I'll do it!
Goddess, are you sure this is right?
My ability scores went up over a total of 160 points?
And look, I only got hit once and my vitality went up by 30 points!
And my strength and dexterity, too!
This has never happened before!
G-Goddess?
Um...
Well...
So, well...
Why did I grow so much, so quickly?
Don't ask me!
Goddess?
Goddess?
Goddess?
Where are you going?
A-A party with my co-workers!
You can go have a
wonderful dinner and a great time all by yourself!
Goddess?
What's with Bell?
I can't believe he grew so much because of that skill...
Does he like that Wallenwhatsit girl that much?
But he's got me already!
Cheers!
The Benevolent Mistress...
You're that adventurer!
You came!
Yes.
I haven't introduced myself.
My name is Syr Flover.
So you're Syr's friend?
You're pretty cute, for an adventurer.
Please leave me alone.
This is 300 valis,
and the drink is 200 valis...
Thanks to that drop item I have 4400 valis,
but I really want to save money for the Familia.
It's not enough, right?
Here's today's special!
I didn't order that!
Don't hold back! You're still young.
Today's special...
It's 850 valis?!
Well?
Are you having fun?
I'm a little overwhelmed...
Sorry.
It looks like I'll be able to count on getting paid a lot tonight.
I'm glad for you.
Isn't it great how many different kinds of people come here?
When there's so many people, there's so many things to discover...
I can't help but get excited.
You could say that my hobby is meeting new people...
It makes my heart pound.
That's a pretty amazing thing to say.
Nya!
The customers with reservations have arrived!
Hey, she's gorgeous!
Idiot! Look at that emblem!
That's the Loki Familia!
The Giant-Killing Familia?
So that's the Sword Princess?
Mister Bell?
Mister Bell?
Good work out there in the dungeon, guys!
We're having a feast tonight!
Drink up!
Okay, let's get drunk!
Cheers.
Cheers.
The Loki Familia are regular customers.
It seems their goddess, Lady Loki, really likes this place.
That hurts, Aiz-tan.
You brought it on yourself.
Then if I come here...
Thank you!
I'll be back!
Okay!
Aiz, let's tell them all about that thing.
That thing?
You know!
We let a bunch of minotaurs escape on our way back.
You took out the last one on the fifth floor, right?
And you remember that tomato dork who was there, right?
A wimpy little kid who'd obviously just started adventuring
got cornered by one of the minotaurs who ran from us.
When Aiz cleaved the minotaur apart, its stinky blood got all over him,
and he looked like a bright red tomato!
And get this!
The tomato dork ran off screaming.
Our princess saved him and he ran away from her!
How pathetic is that?
I think in that situation, he can hardly be blamed.
Enough, Bete.
It was our fault for letting the minotaurs escape from the seventeenth floor.
You should be ashamed.
What's wrong with saying trash is trash?
What do you think, Aiz?
Just hypothetically,
who would you choose?
Me? Or the tomato dork?
Bete, you're drunk, aren't you?
I'm talking to you, Aiz!
If that kid asked you out, would you say yes?
No way, right?
A wimp who's weaker than you has no right to stand beside you.
You yourself would never allow that!
A wimp isn't good enough for you.
Not for Aiz Wallenstein.
Mister Bell!
What? A dine-and-dash?
Miss Aiz?
He's got guts, trying to pull that at Mama Mia's house!
Was that...?
Why is this happening to me?
You're drunk.
Cool off for a bit.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
I can't forgive myself...
I wanted something to happen without doing anything myself!
I have to do it...
I have to do it all...
Or I can't even stand by her side!
War Shadows?
Gotta do it!
Gotta do it!
Gotta do it!
Gotta do it!
Gotta do it!
Gotta do it!
If you want to get there...
Where did Bell go?
He never came home last night.
Maybe he's never...
Bell?
Bell!
Goddess...
I want to get stronger.
Okay.
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Listen, Bell.
You're sleeping on the bed, not the sofa, today.
You're hurt, so don't worry about it, okay?
Sorry, Goddess...
I'm so tired...
Maybe I'll sleep next to you in exchange.
That's fine.
Let's sleep together.
What?
Wait, Bell!
Normally, you'd freak out.
That's what I was hoping for when I said it!
So basically, you see...
He's already asleep!
