Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Where is Erza?
Some people who claimed to be Erza's old pals
appeared in front of us while we were at Akane beach on vacation.
Long time no see... Sister.
And in no time at all...
It'll be all right! I'll yell it out countless times.
I believe your every tomorrow will be shining.
The intersection of all people
Never giving up. And that's why we're not gonna lose!
When it seems like you'll be blown away by the headwinds,
grasp this hand, try to take a chance.
Because you're not alone anymore, got it?
Go forward, more and more!
Don't give up on your awesome dream!
That's right, don't cry!
Move on, my way!
Now, with the light shining down upon you.
Don't even think about something like giving up!
Even if you trade being hurt again for strength.
Your eyes, always looking straight ahead,
can surely see the light!
It still exists? Impossible!
The R-system, that a black-magic cult plotted to construct around ten years ago...
I thought we had destroyed the seven towers ourselves...
There was an eighth tower.
In the Ka Elm Sea.
Looking at it... Could it be complete?
The investigation team went missing right after they sent these pictures.
They're finishing it, I guess...
Why the R-system now?
The Tower of Heaven.
Not the R-system, the Tower of Heaven.
Who cares what we call it?
That's forbidden magic!
If even its existence were known, it would cause a huge uproar!
We must send the military immediately and suppress them!
But we're up against...
Who?
The incident that occurred on Akane beach last night...
According to reports from witness vacationers there,
it seems the people occupying the R-system now are not that magical cult.
So, wait! Who in the world is it?
It sounds like that person is going by the name of Jellal...
Jellal?
Your twin brother, right, Siegrain?
Yes... I am aware of that.
Jellal!
Hey, do you think the people trapped in the cards were saved?
We alerted the army, so they're probably fine by now.
I hope so...
But anyway, where are we?
Perhaps Juvia's group has gotten lost...
Natsu, are you sure they're in this direction?
We're relying on your nose here!
Get it together, man!
I will not allow you to betray Gray-sama's trust!
Damn...
I can't believe that Erza and Happy were kidnapped while we were knocked out.
How pathetic is that?!
But how did a wizard as powerful as Erza-san get defeated?
She wasn't defeated!
You don't know a damn thing about Erza!
I-I'm sorry!
Gray, calm down!
They said they were Erza's old friends.
Even we don't know anything about Erza, really...
Something feels really dangerous...
The birds...
What in the world is this?
The fish too?
This is not normal...
This wreckage... It's from Fiore military ships!
I don't like this...
Hey, look.
That's the Tower of Heaven?
Water Dome!
Let us camouflage ourselves this way and approach.
W-Whoa...
You actually completed it?
It's been eight years since then, hasn't it?
We completed it.
Eight years...
You guys have all changed...
I just can't...
We're almost there, sheesh!
Don't you have any sense of dramatic tension?!
The ceremony will take place tonight.
Until then, stay right here, Sister.
Ceremony?
You're going to activate the R-system?
Too bad, you know? It's your fault for betraying us.
Jellal is angry. But it's an honor for you.
You've been chosen as the living sacrifice for the ceremony!
I guess I won't get to see you again, Sister.
But we do it all for paradise...
You're shaking?
Scared of becoming a living sacrifice?
Or is it because this is the very place...
You think you can escape so easily, you little brats?
At a time when we need to finish the R-System quicky!
Hold up... At this rate we'd get way behind schedule.
I was going to send you all to that room, but...
Who is the one who came up with the escape plan? I'll only take that one away.
Aren't we such nice guys?
Spit it out! Who is the mastermind?
Me...
I'm the one!
I made the plan, and I told them what to do!
Of course.
It wasn't you, I see.
It was that girl.
Take her away!
No! It was me! I planned it!
It's not Erza!
Let Erza go!
I'll be okay...
I'm fine...
Erza!
It'll be just like you said, Jellal... I'm not scared at all.
Erza...
Erza!
Sorry about back then, Sister.
I was the one who planned it, but I was scared and didn't say anything.
It's not fair, you know?
It's long in the past...
Do you understand the danger of trying to resurrect someone using the R-system?
You know what the R-system is for? I'm impressed.
Revive System...
To resurrect a single person using a large number of human sacrifices...
It's forbidden, inhumane magic.
Sister... Magic has always been at odds with humanity.
All magic erodes one's humanity.
That's black-magic sophism. You're no different from them!
They thought this was just a way to reunite body with soul.
They didn't realize it was more than just magic to bring someone back from the dead.
But Jellal is different!
He'll be leading us to heaven shortly!
Heaven?
When Jellal resurrects that certain individual, the world will be reborn.
With us as its rulers.
The last remnants of the cult who took away our freedom,
You, my trator Sister and your friends...
The pitiful citizens living their lives in ignorance!
Those incompetent fools on the Council!
They will all cower in fear, be drenched in grief!
Then we'll take away everyone's freedom!
We will become the rulers of the world!
Sister...
Sho...
Sis!
To think people can change so much...
Jellal...
Is this your doing, you fiend?
It's all cats!
Where am I?
Where's Natsu?
It's a cat-woman!
Feelin' spiffy?
Feelin' spiffy...
It's a talking kitty cat!
Millianna, why don't you try being more of a dandy?
It's you!
It isn't a talking cat. It's a cat because it talks, get it?
I see!
I don't get that at all!
And wait, where am I? Where's Natsu?
Hey cat! That boy is probably kissing asphalt right now!
No way Natsu's been done in like that!
We have a report! Erza Scarlet has escaped!
Escaped? Just like old times!
There's no escape from this tower...
Please hurry!
Erza's here too...
What a pain...
Lord Jellal...
I knew Erza would make a good woman.
How intriguing, indeed.
I'm looking forward to see who wins: Erza or myself.
Life and death...
A game of heaven which connects the past and future.
We have to do something...
First, gather information!
We must dispatch the entire military!
You bleeding-heart doves...
What do you mean?
Sieg, you bastard!
Sending the military?
What else could I call someone with that weak a response?
This is dangerous... Far too dangerous!
What are you trying to say?
You people don't understand.
There is only one way to destroy the Tower of Heaven now.
Otherwise we are all doomed for sure.
Etherion!
What did you say?!
The cross-dimensional destruction magic?!
Are you mad?!
You've seen its predicted destructive power, right?
It has the power to destroy an entire country!
Etherion is our ultimate weapon!
It's even more dangerous magic than the R-system!
However...
But with the satellite square, we could target this entire area.
And the only thing that could destroy such a large building is Etherion!
I concur.
Ultear, you too?
There are 9 of us in total. Only three more are needed.
If three more people agree than we fire Etherion!
There's no time!
We can't let him use the R-system!
That will end with your twin brother Jellal losing his life, you know.
Of course.
That's just how terrible a system it is.
Tell me where Jellal is!
There are a lot of lookouts...
Should we bust in?
No! Erza and Happy are captured!
If we don't do this right, we could put the two of them in danger.
That would put us at a disadvantage.
I've found a way in underwater.
Really? That's great!
I have been praised!
Not you, but I, Juvia!
Riiight...
It's about ten minutes underwater.
That ain't a problem.
Nope.
No way! Impossible!
Then put this on your head.
It's oxygen trapped in a water shell, so you can breath underwater.
You're awesome!
So... Who are you?
So this is that base of the tower...
Where's Erza and Happy?
These things are pretty convenient, if a bit tacky...
I made yours a bit smaller, Lucy-san, so I'm impressed you made it.
Hey, wait a sec there...
Intruders!
Crap!
Who are these infidels!
Well then...
Right!
You're asking who we are?
Your allies attacked us, and you don't even know?!
We're Fairy Tail, you idiots!
That's hot!
Ice Make Lance!
That's cold!
A swimsuit!
Thank you very much!
Gate of the Maiden, I open thee!
Virgo!
You called for me, Princess?
It's a maid!
Who needs bikini-girl now?
Proceed with the punishment, please...
As you wish...
Damn, what is she?
Watch out, blades don't affect her!
Take this!
What the heck is with her?
Drip, drip, drop...
Water Slicer!
We're mostly finished here.
Seems like it.
After making all this noise, do you think we'll be...
Oh, who am I kidding...
Do I need punishment?
Where's the blockhead?
And...
They're telling us, Come on up?
Lord Jellal, why are you inviting the intruders inside?
I told you, remember? This is a game.
They have cleared a stage.
That is all.
This makes things more interesting.
But if we don't hurry with the ceremony...
The ships we sunk the other day mean that the Council has already...
Vidaldus, are you still worried about that?
I-I concur!
Elder Leiji!
We have no choice.
Only two more.
There is no time.
They can't stop me.
Not those fools on the Council, that's for sure.
Blockhead!
Don't yell like that!
We already made such a big mess downstairs...
There's no reason for us to be sneaking around anymore.
What are you eating?
It looks like a meal has been prepared.
Shall you partake, Princess?
Um, look here...
That door from before was operated by remote control through magic.
Our presence is completely known.
Then why in the world...
Maybe they're challenging us?
A challenge?
Oh, yes, Princess... Do you think it is appropriate to eat in such attire?
Appropriate?
Let us change those clothes...
Right here?!
Hey, wait...
Gray-sama! Don't look!
These are clothes from the Spirit World.
What do you think? I know, I know... I look good...
That's pretty cute!
Juvia is so frustrated!
He lllikes her!
Please don't roll your tongue...
Where did you learn to mimic Happy?
Meanwhile, what should I do?
Princess, I wish you best of luck.
Thank you, Virgo.
Speaking of which, are you sure you want to stay in those wet clothes?
We'll dry them off in a jiff.
Human drying machine!
There they are!
The intruders!
Erza!
You're safe!
Cool...
Why are you here?
Why?
Um... Juvia is...
Go back!
This is not a place you should have come!
Don't go sayin' that, Erza!
If we retreat with our tails between out legs,
that'll shame the name of Fairy Tail!
I am not going to let that Blockhead off easy!
I said go back.
But...
Happy's been kidnapped!
You expect me to leave him?
Happy?
Millianna couldn't have...
Where is he?
I don't know...
The ocean?
Okay, got it!
What do you get?
Happy is waiting for me!
Natsu...
That idiot.
Natsu-san...
We're going too!
No!
Millianna loves cats above all else.
I cannot believe that she would do harm to Happy.
I will take responsibility for bringing both of them back.
You get away from here as quickly as you can.
No! Not without you, Erza!
This is my problem!
I do not want to get you involved.
It's already plenty our problem.
You saw Natsu, right?
Erza, what is this tower? Who is Jellal?
I understand if you don't want to tell us...
You said that they used to be your companions, right?
But now we're your companions...
We're on your side, no matter what Erza!
You heard the lady.
Go back!
Erza...
This isn't like you, Ms. Erza...
You'd usually say, Follow me and no complaining!
We'll lend you a hand.
Even you get scared sometimes, right?
I'm sorry.
Whether I win or lose this battle, I will vanish from this world...
What do you mean?
This is a future I cannot oppose.
Therefore...
Therefore while I still exist, I'll tell you everything.
The name of this tower is the Tower of Heaven.
Also known as the R-system.
More than ten years ago...
A black-magic religious cult
constructed it in order to cast a forbidden spell to resurrect someone from the dead.
It requires a large number of living sacrifices.
Also, through the slave-labor of the sacrificial humans,
they amplified the magical power they needed.
I was also one of those living sacrifices when I was little.
Those who tried to escape, or rebelled...
One by one they disappeared.
There was no peace of mind.
We lived in constant fear.
Even so, I made friends who I could open up to.
Even if it was for only a brief moment...
And one of the people I knew then was Jellal.
Erza!
Erza!
Hey, hang in there!
Your eye...
What have they done... Erza...
What did we do to deserve this, Erza?
No!
Jellal...
Erza, thank goodness!
It's okay now. I've come to save you.
H-How?
There's no turning back now.
We have to fight.
Fight?
Damn it!
It's the magic troops!
I wonder if Sis is okay?
Grandpa Rob, you came back alive from that room, right?
What in the world is that place...
I think Erza-chan should be fine...
As long as you have a strong heart, they can't steal your soul.
What is that supposed to mean?
Get in there.
Sis!
Erza...
Hey, where's Jellal?
It's time for work!
Leave her be.
Just be glad she's back alive at a time like this...
But...
They must have taken a replacement.
No more...
I can't stand this anymore!
Quiet down there!
Calm down, Sho!
It'll be okay... I'm here beside you.
Prepare yourself.
No!!
We have to fight.
Why, you...
What are you doing?
Hey...
No way...
They're rebelling!
Erza, what are you...
Take their weapons!
If we obey them, or run away, we'll never be free!
We have to fight!
For our freedom, rise up and fight!
For our freedom...
To save Jellal... We rose up and fought.
Jellal was our leader... He had a strong sense of justice, and I looked up to him.
But...
But it was right at that moment that Jellal turned into a completely different person.
If it is possible to call a person evil, then that is what I shall call Jellal.
Natsu, have you heard a strange voice at night lately?
A strange voice?
I haven't heard anything weird myself...
I can hear it...
Night after night, a girl's voice, softly sobbing...
Seriously?
That sounds pretty cool!
I don't think it's cool at all!
Next time: Voice of Darkness!
So, what is that poltergeist saying?
The rent... Oh, the rent! etc...
I'm pretty sure that's just Lucy.
