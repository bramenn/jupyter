My only thought as
I don't think so!
I am put out to sea is to ask the fishermen
Is she hurt?
Chihaya, too?!
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm okay.
What's wrong?
Why does it hurt like this?
Didn't I just jam it?
What is this?
What's wrong?
Ayase...
Ayase, you can't hide it from me.
I'm right next to you.
Two girls have gotten injured playing their hearts out.
I keep losing when it counts,
and I'm behind Mr. Excavator right now.
When am I going to come through?!
It has to be now!
Excuse me.
The passion...
The passion always comes from Chihaya,
but this feels different.
I can feel something burning in my chest like magma.
I know what this is.
This is how it feels
when five people refuse to give up!
Chihaya Furu
Episode 18
My fear is that you will forget
Chihaya-chan is down six cards.
Porky is down three cards.
President Mashima is down four cards.
Tsukuba-kun and Desktomu-kun are both down seven cards.
Everyone's losing,
but I can feel
their refusal to give up!
It's time for you to learn
that there are times when spirit isn't enough to cut it.
A mountain village grows...
He's good,
but he's not as good as Arata.
Why do I feel that way?
What's with his hands...
Arata's definitely better than he is!
Arata...
I'm happy when I forget you,
but then I feel encouraged when I remember you.
I'm no good.
I'm a bad forgetter.
Coach Sakurazawa's F-cup boobies...
Coach Sakurazawa's F-cup boobies...
Excuse me.
Again?
17 cards to 12 cards.
I'm down by five.
Let's get started.
You've improved, Eyebrows.
I'll spot you a 5 card handicap starting today.
Dr. Harada started with five more cards than I did
on the first practice match of the day.
The memorization left over from the prior four matches today
and the card movements during this match
will go away!
Excuse me.
I'll spot you...
when people and grass grow scarce
I'll spot you...
That's the best swing I've seen from the Prez this match!
Now...
Let's get started.
H-He's good.
I can't do anything against him.
I doubt I'll be able to win my game.
It won't be that easy.
I want to overcome...
I want to overcome my own analysis.
So spring nights, So spring ends.
So the flower has, So the flower petals.
Plenty of similar cards remaining.
Extend and retract.
Extend and retract.
Feel sorrow.
Feel love is a dead card, so I want to be careful.
If I hear sorrow, I have to attack.
I have to take it.
Repeatedly check the card so my body remembers the path to take.
Take it.
Take the card, Tsukuba.
The Zodiac series is magnificent.
If that card's read, I'll go Virgo.
If it's that card, I'll go Libra.
He's weird.
He's weird and he's not taking me seriously.
He's using those pointless poses to scare me
while taking my cards!
I can't become a hero like this!
There are two cards you absolutely have to be good at.
Feel love deepen and Feel sorrow wash?
I'm good at both of those.
Same here.
Ditto.
I won't lose those cards, either.
Feel sorrow was a poem by Oe no Chisato about pale moonlight.
When looking at the moon, you will be overcome by sorrow,
as you realize that autumn belongs to...
I don't really understand how you can
get sentimental about looking at the moon,
but...
Feel sorrow wash...
When I see a card that I've practiced constantly on the tatami,
I get a confidence boost!
He got it!
He did it!
Now things are going our way!
Chihaya-chan.
Seven cards in a row!
She's cut the deficit down to three!
Amazing...
Lacking experience playing under pressure.
Rion...
She's getting faster.
What about her injury?
Is she not really hurt?
It's not often that you get to play an opponent with such amazing game sense.
Yama-chan, give me the best you've got.
That's what I'm doing.
My fear is that you will forget...
What is Rion doing?!
She guaranteed that she would win her game!
Uh, have you chosen a card to send?
Doesn't matter!
Take this one!
I love everything that is beautiful.
No to outdoors
That's why I chose not to participate in sports that would get me dirty.
No to getting sweaty
Stretching?
I didn't know that karuta was just as intense until after
Jogging?
It'll help keep you beautiful
I was already hooked.
But...
While most players slap away at the cards,
Rion was special.
She was beautiful.
Win, Rion!
If you can't win in such favorable circumstances,
you'll get picked on again!
By me!
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
One win for Fujisaki!
Focus, Rion!
He doesn't blow at his bangs when he's in trouble.
It's a signal that he's about to get serious.
My analysis was incomplete.
I wasn't up to the task...
This is the strength of a Fujisaki third-year!
You're very fortunate, Rion.
I was worried that it would be unfair for me to participate as a reader,
but your opponent's game sense rivals yours.
I thought he was the only one out there capable of that.
Kyo...
Yamashiro Kyoko-san...
Please allow me to record your reading.
but instead you see a pale moon in the dawn sky
Said world...
Chihaya-chan, Said world grants no escape
and Said world grants no change are the same up to the fourth syllable,
but they have completely different meanings.
You could say they're different as light and dark.
Said world grants no escape, I hide in the mountains,
only to hear the haunting cry of a deer
It invokes the image of a dead end.
Said world grants no change, I pray,
when the fisherman who casts his nets can seem dear
You can feel a longing for the eternal.
Said world
grants no change, I pray,
No way!
They both moved before the unique syllable was read!
Said world grants no escape is still in play!
Were they gambling?
That's the only possible explanation.
Same time.
So close.
It was on Yama-chan's side, so she gets it.
There's something very wrong about this pain.
Ignore it!
But it hurts!
It hurts...
Ignore it!
Why...
Why do I think it was Arata who brought Shinobu-chan here?
I'm not interested in team tournaments.
I'm focused on winning the individual tournament.
I might not be able to play in the individual tournament.
I might not get to play Arata or Shinobu-chan.
But!
We all feel the same way.
In this team match,
we're only focused on winning!
Like I was saying!
We lost because we didn't have enough members.
Adult tournaments are dominated by Fukui,
so there should be plenty of experienced players.
I guess.
Can I go to the restroom?
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
How many experienced players are in our high school?
I'll do some research when next term starts.
I can feel the air grow thinner
as the number of cards on the tatami dwindles towards the end.
Who will it be?
Who will it be?
Who will be the next to win
and take a breath?
The championship match is intense,
but all five games in the third-place match are within three cards.
This is big!
They aren't backing down.
Both schools came here to win the tournament.
They can no longer accomplish that goal,
yet their spirits haven't broken?
Feels the presence of a serpent
It's the same with everything.
The main reason people continue to fight after losing...
After I determined to abandon...
is because other people are still watching.
Defended!
Same here!
Nice job, Megumu!
Take the next one, team!
I feel sick.
I took one!
Keep attacking, Shiroyama!
Stay focused!
Hokuo will win!
Yeah!
I feel sick.
I should have left...
I won another close game.
Shinobu-chan, that makes us rivals.
Shinobu-chan, play against Ryuusei-kun next.
We should keep Shinobu-chan away from children her age.
She'll learn to go easy on her opponents.
The more alone she is, the stronger she'll become.
Why am I remembering this now?
I should have left.
But...
is that I have no way to tell you in person
While it may be beyond...
Who won that one?
Was it the Fujisaki player?
I'm standing right next to them and it's still hard...
I will make the call on that last play.
Thank you very much.
Neither of them are contesting the card,
so this isn't the typical time for a referee to step in,
but I want to let them focus.
It's rare for two players with such amazing game sense
to play one another.
You need to move back.
Rion's having a hard time!
I should have played instead.
The coach made the wrong decision!
The match started off with plenty of
three-syllable cards and very few one-syllable cards.
Rion had the advantage,
given her familiarity with the voice of Yamashiro, rank 7.
At least in the early game.
She should have pressed that advantage to seal the game away early.
What will you do now, Rion?
There are one-syllable cards everywhere.
So the flower has wilted...
I've never lost a match with Grandma as the reader.
I was convinced
that I could defeat the Queen if Grandma was reading.
You'll have a lot to answer for if you lose in the number one seat.
No...
I don't want to lose!
I don't want to lose!
Shinobu-chan...
We don't belong to teams,
so we can only focus on making ourselves stronger.
Our love for karuta is real,
Our beloved world of karuta can only grow
through the recruiting,
teaching,
and encouraging of new players.
It's team players who keep this game alive.
Doesn't matter.
It's got nothing to do with me.
Nobody will ever take me seriously.
Nobody...
Please wait!
Ayase-san,
Nishida-kun, and Tsukuba-kun are all doing their best...
against Fujisaki!
Mashima-kun is still down by 5 cards!
He can't catch up!
That early mistake is making a difference.
He stabilized midway through the game and made some good plays,
but his luck is still terrible!
He wants to attack, but the last five cards have all been on his side!
I can see why this guy is their captain.
He doesn't over-memorize.
It's something I'm too scared to try.
He wasn't targeting the two cards I just lost.
He moved his body halfway
across the field before making his move,
and I still lost.
He covers on two-syllable cards.
If I press the issue, he manages to block me.
He doesn't commit faults.
He's got confidence and the stamina to back it up.
Damn...
We're both on our fifth match.
The last five cards have been on my side.
Should I focus on defending the seven cards on my side
instead of attacking the two on the opponent's side?
Living Ghost
I don't need you, Dr. Harada.
What?!
When in trouble...
As the years pass...
Go lower right!
Yes!
He got it!
He wasn't blindly attacking the lower right!
As my is still in play, so he covered before taking it!
He was able to block his opponent!
Amazing!
Tsukuba-kun...
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Damn it. Damn it.
So you know how to use proper technique.
Shining Rainbow
You were just toying with me.
You're pretty good.
You forced me to use
my Gear Second!
Not happy
Tsukuba-kun, please win for me.
Two wins for Fujisaki!
Good!
One more win!
One more win for the championship!
Yeah!
Mizusawa's down 0 to 2.
This is tough.
Fujisaki's got this in the bag.
It's impressive that they
came out of nowhere to make the grand finale.
They're strong.
That makes it a five-peat for Fujisaki.
I'm sending a card.
the cresting waves almost look like clouds in the skies
A multi-syllable card?
My only thought as I was already read,
so this is now a two-syllable card.
You won't be able to surprise me.
I'm sticking to my usual playing style.
This is painful.
It would be most gratifying if Mizusawa was able
to secure a single win from the dominating Fujisaki.
Three wins.
We're getting three wins, guys.
