This makes the person using it to become useless.
Let's see, 0-1-2...
Hey!
Something important in Japonet?
N-no, I'm just a very good friend of Danny Takematsu.
And was wondering how he was doing.
When did you two met?
You just want that pillow don't you?
Stop wasting money and use the cat one.
Wake up Umaru.
I bought something amazing.
Ah, What is it Onii-chan?
I just went shopping.
Here you go!
Uh! That pillow!
Yes, the pillow that makes people useless.
That was its name?
Yes that is correct.
It seems like you're advertising it.
Alright, look closely.
This mellowness...
Ah I'm becoming useless.
No!
The always earnest Onii-san, in an instant has become a good for nothing.
This pillow is dangerous.
That's what all my cells are telling me.
But, if its only for a little while.
Japoneko, Japoneko, the low prices of Japoneko are irresistible.
Alright, today we bring you this product.

What happened?
N-nothing it was only a dream.
I see.
Nekolombus, If I remember, Onii-chan won it at a rock-paper-scissors tournament.
I haven't use it much lately.
It might felt lonely.
Wait! I actually got it from an internet auction.
The nekolonbus received at the competition.
Wake up Umaru.
It's time to go to school.
Right now I'll present my new song.
Oh! sexy-sama 20...
As I thought that pillow is dangerous.
Ah, Ebitake-san.
The beach trip was fun!
Y-yes! I'm Ebina though.
And? You wanted to ask me something?
You seem to be in a good mood today.
Did something happened?
I'm meeting with my former rival whom now has become a great ally.
A great?... Oh! You made plans to meet with a friend!
I've made no plans!
Eh?
Even without a set date, fate will bring us together!
Have a good day Ebishima-san.
Its Ebina!
Ah- I thought we could spend more time together.
That's why...
Did something happened, Umaru-san?
I-I'm sorry but something just came up.
Just as I thought, you were in the Arcade.
We'll have our meeting about defeating Umaru-san!
Y-You know TSF-san, I'd like to set a date before we meet.
Ah... set a date?
I had to run and put on my disguise.
Ah! A convenience store.
I'm a bit thirsty so I'd like to buy a coke...
I'll go with you!
T-This is!
What?
The almost sold out lottery around the country.
Migu convenience lottery!
I didn't thought there would be one here.
On top of that, they have the super rare A prize,
The limited edition Migu figure!
Super rare
I don't have a lot of money!
TSF-san, is it ok if I play for a little bit?
Yeah, sure.
There are rules when playing a convenience store lottery.
You must quickly get the ticket...
Since this is a store after all.
If you take too long, you'll bother the people waiting in line.
Also, is sort of embarrassing.
The chances of getting the A prize are 50 to 1.
However since several people have played already there should be around 30 to 1.
That means, if I play twice I have a 1 to 15 probability.
1 to 15...
Is not bad, I can make it.
I'll win with Umaru's great luck!
D prize
Why did the D prize came out twice!? This price is useless!
UMR-san...
You are my friend, I'll make sure to break your bad luck!
E prize
It's beautiful!
All of them are the worst prize.
To lose even with both of us playing, I can't believe it.
Though, the dangerous thing about a lottery...
Maybe next time I'll get it!
The believe of getting it next time, the lust of gambling.
You don't need this UMR-san?
-Yeah, I'll give it to you.
-How nice!
If I run home and bring more money...
No, I can even ask for Onii-chan's card.
Here!, with this we can set a date for the next time we meet!
You seem to be in a good mood.
You think so?

Yakiniku!
TL: Meaning grilled meat, is a Japanese term which, in its broadest sense, refers to grilled meat dishes.
O-Onii-chan, going out for yakiniku...
Is it ok to spend so much Onii-chan?
I-its ok, I just got paid after all.
I can't wait any longer.
Yeah! Eat all you want!
But, it would've been nice to invite Ebina-chan.
We couldn't ask her since she wasn't home.
Let's invite her next time.
Well, shall we start then...
Wait!
W-what is it?
Is it the hood?
Could you leave the grilling to me?
W-What a serious look!
This looks like that legendary grilling magistrate.
Yakiniku Magistrate - The person that roasts the meat.
I'll start with the seasoned meat.
Grilled meat tastes best when eaten with other people.
But, eating it alone is also a good experience.
Gradually adding what you'll eat...
Sometimes when eating with a lot of people you end up putting too much meat.
Making the temperature go down, so you should be careful.
Don't you think you're adding too much?
W-what have I done!
My brother is getting worked up...
If we turned it around the onion might fall off,
So its better to fold it instead.
The heat will reach the inside so there's no problem.
Delish
Everything fell off!
I-I'm sorry, I'll try to be more careful.
You've burnt everything!
After eating a good seasoned meat,
The next thing must be the start of grilled meat, Calvi!
The contrast created between the bright and opaque colors...
Might as well be the art of grilling meat.
The sound made by the oil as it starts gushing out from the meat into the heat,
The harmony produced is like the whisper of fairies.
This is delicious.
Now its gotten bigger due to the oil from the Calvi.
I've burnt the meat again!
In a way, the rice is the protagonist of Yakiniku.
The kishihikari rice from the north goes well with any type of meat.
By absorbing the meat juice, the sweet rice makes the flavor of meat go one step higher.
Akita is the best!
Forgive me Umaru.
Because of me, the meat has...
Harakiri of the Grilling Magistrate
-Here.
T-this is?
Is the Calvi I grilled.
That's for you.
Retirement of the Grilling Magistrate
Let's eat then!
Delicious!
The meat and rice were great, I ate from the fresh greens,
To the recently taken out meats.
I'm so happy.
Well then, I should go.
Boy did I ate.
Ending the meal with a cola is the best, don't you think Onii-chan?
Is that so.
The bill please.
Ebina-chan?
Umaru-chan whit Onii-san!?
The grilled meat!
-Eating yakiniku alone...
-She's in another level.
October
Ah... today was also a hard day.
I'll make a quick dinner...
I'm home...
W-what the?
Trick or treat!
R-right... Is almost Halloween.
How good,
I had just gone to buy some candy.
Here, happy Halloween!
Don't you have normal candy?
Go buy some Onii-chan.
No way, I just got home.
Rice crackers are also good.
The feeling is important too...
If you don't give me candy...
I'll play some...
Yay Kirie-chan, it was a success!
Yes, master!
Halloween is not about scaring people!
Why are you suddenly celebrating Halloween?
I was playing with Kirie-chan and it came up...
It's October already...
Yeah...
Weren't you just eating candy!?
I know is sudden but, when talking about October...?
Halloween!
Ghost!
Candy!
What are you supposed to do in Halloween?
We could try wearing costumes.
Costumes?
If I'm not wrong, around here...
And that's how we got here.
Ok, I'll go shopping once more.
Speaking of, Onii-chan is not wearing a costume.
You're right, let's prepare him one.
One hour later
A pumpkin gratin!
Pumpkin pizza, pumpkin salad.
Pumpkin omelet, pumpkin soup.
Whaa.. Looks really good.
Halloween is a party to celebrate the October harvest.
So we should have some plates made from pumpkin.
If you say it wearing that, you look like a chef, Onii-chan
Now that you say it, what's up with this, it has a bit of blood...
You're the chef of the game Delicious Zombie
Don't turn me into a weird cosplayer.
It suits him...
Oh! It's ready.
The pumpkin pie is ready!
It's really good!
It feels as if we were in a different country.
Kirie-chan, we're already abroad!
Cola
Grape Juice
The smoothness of the bed,
I'd like to spend my life above one.
Ah The classes of tomorrow and the ones the day after...
How boring.
I want to go back to the everyday paradise of summer break.
Summer break, even now I can't forget you.
Being Fall already, a typhoon should come so I can stay at home.
The next day
Wake up Umaru.
It's time to go to school.
Eat breakfast and get ready.
I don't want to...
I think I might have a fever.
It seems like you do.
I think you should rest today
Be sure to rest, I'll try to get home early.
Even though you were waiting her, I'm sorry Ebina-chan.
I'm a bit worried about Umaru.
I-I'm running late!
This is the first time I fake sick to stay at home.
Secret fever by friction technique
What should I do?
Well... It doesn't matter.
Since I've skipped school I'll make this my day off!
Now that its been decided, I'll slack like never before.
I feel like time goes by really slowly.
Was it really ok to skip school?
So you lied to me Umaru...
You're the worst.
I shouldn't have called you master.
Desu-wa
Feeling guilty
Will Umaru-chan be ok?
The third period is about to start.
Eh? Umaru-chan?
Didn't you take the day off?
I felt better so I decided to come.
-Are you ok Umaru-chan?
-Yeah.
You shouldn't push yourself.
You did well by showing up, Umaru-san.
We shall have a battle in today's exam.
Don't make the recently recovered Umaru-san feel pressured.
Alright, in order to make it fair, I'll only use my left hand.
That makes no sense at all!
D-Don't fight.
I'll be the winner!
It seems your fever went down.
Still, you should rest a bit more.
Umaru!
-I'm sorry!
U.M.R. yeah! U.M.R. yeah!
Not a UMA! Umaru!
U.M.R. yeah! U.M.R. yeah!
Not a UMA! Umaru!
I'm always 120 devoted to fun!

I'm always near you, smiling,
and feeling your warmth.
Our time together's full of tenderness.
Even from afar, I understand you.
That glint of mischief in your eye.
I hold those capricious days dear to my heart.
I find myself, without thinking
Go on
ho ra
calling your name.
Still half dreaming
Still not sure how I feel.
It's time

But maybe I can tell you now.
Thank you!
We'll never change, our smiles
will forever keep their sparkle.
We'll treasure the seasons we spent together.
We'll never forget
Someday we'll bid childhood farewell,
but that's still a distant dream.
For now, let me slumber by your side.
