Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
My love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
This is no good.
Hey, Karin! Wait!
There've been so many incidents like this lately.
Sightings of UFOs, poltergeists
It's probably because of them.
Is something there?
It's better you can't see them. They'll only make you sick.
Huh? What was that?
A cat?!
W-What?!
What is that?! It's coming this way! Get it off me, Karin!
I'm not sure what's happening, but I won't lose!
That'll teach them!
That was scary!
Karin, look!
Doesn't it look like brother?
Huh? It's Ichigo!
Heyisn't there something wrong with this cat?
Uhhmmm
I have this strange feeling
like I've seen it somewhere before.
Right?
Huh? Meow?
Oh, I see.
What'd it say?
It's hungry.
Are you serious?
Yup, I'm not positive, but it's a woman's intuition.
Hmm? And do you remember where you saw this cat before?
Nope, not at all.
Oh Cat food! Let's go buy cat food.
All right.
Man, this is so annoying. It's useless cleaning up.
No one's gonna come to a store like this.
I don't think that's true.
Tell me how many customers we had this month.
Well
Not one!
That hurts, Jinta!
Shut up!
Hollow spotted!
Disposal complete.
Ever since Carrot-top left, they've increased.
I know!
I think I'm not getting enough exercise lately.
I think I've gained weight.
I have something to take care of that.
I bought this on the Grasshopper Shopping Channel.
It's the original weight-loss remedy, Karugaru-kun.
Wow. Sounds questionable Huh?
I mean I just don't believe in such products.
Well, I tried it myself and the results were quite amazing.
Is something wrong?
Something's growling. Jinta?
Jinta? Awright!
Its time!
For the sake of the town, it's time to exterminate Hollows!
We'll get scolded if we don't clean up.
I can't understand what you're saying!
I think there's something wrong with this cat, after all.
Huh? Why?
Hmm Just a feeling.
There's nothing wrong with you, right, Raku?
What's Raku”?
Its name. That's what I named it.
Raku as in rakuda or camel, because it's the color of my camel-colored underpants.
Camel-colored underpants?
Huh?!
What's this car parked in front of our house? It's so huge.
It's obstructing our business!
W-What?!
You there, cute ladies
Spirits are always with you!
Ah! It's Don Kanonji!
A-Are you all right?
Sorry. Maybe I startled you.
Are you the boy's family?
Huh? Boy?
Of course! My 1 pupil, Ichigo!
Huh? Brother's your 1 pupil?!
Of course!
Wow! Wonderful! Really?!
Brother is your 1 pupil! Wow! I have a rare day off today,
so I came here incognito to play with him, but
Where is the boy?
Incognito? And making such a big scene?
Brother isn't home.
OhmyGod!
If you're done here, go home.
That's!
Why you bad spirits!
You stay there!
Mr. Kanonji! Karin, what's that?
Huh? You can see that?
Oh. Now that you mention it
I see. I see. You are able to see them now, too.
Sorry, but I'm going straight to the finish!
Golden Cannonball!
Carelessness is the greatest enemy!
Agh! They have no mercy!
Mr. Kanonji!
Huh? What?
The legendary Red Bat!
Mission complete!
Hey!
Mr. Kanonji!
Are you all right?
Are you hurt, little girl?
I-I'm okay.
Huh? Is he for real?! That's Don Kanonji!
Hey! Yuzu! Karin!
Did Mr. Kanonji save you? I'm so jealous!
Mission complete! Bohahahaha!
Mr. Kanonji, won't you join us for tea?
You two come with me, too! If I may say so myself
its pretty good tea.
Kanonji! Kanonji! Kanonji! Hey! Where're you going?!
By the way, who are you two?
I'm the one who'll be clean-up batter in the Majors someday, Jinta.
I'm Ururu.
I'm Yuzu Kurosaki.
Kurosaki?
So you know Carrot-top?
You know our brother?
In a way
That cat
It seems the Hollows are appearing, lured by its spiritual power.
Hollow? Those things just now?
Yup. We should probably let that cat's spirit pass over peacefully.
Huh? Raku isn't a ghost.
Huh? What're you saying? That's a spirit.
Is not! Don't say such things!
I-It's true! That cat's already dead!
It's not dead! Cut it out already!
Hey! You're Carrot-top's sisters, and you can't even figure that out?!
Wonderful and great!
Isn't it amazing?!
Although you pale in comparison to me,
imagine kids with such talent gathering here!
You will all be my disciples!
Not interested!
I like you more and more, boys and girls.
I've been seeking your type, those with youthful power!
Now come with me!
Hey! Come! Come!
Mister, want another one?
How unfortunate The power hidden within you
I will acknowledge that.
However, that's a little short!
All right! I shall take a good look at your powers!
I don't understand all this,
but it's my chance to show you my true power!
Well, sorry I still haven't gotten serious either.
Such energetic children! I'm taller than you!
Now come with me! Height has nothing to do with it!
Of course, it does!
Come, young ones! The future is in your hands!
That cat Left like that, it'll be attacked again.
No wayand Mr. Kanonji is gone.
What'll I do?
I'll ask the boss.
Huh?
Lunch Time
Sorry
It's all right. Don't worry about it.
What'll you do?
If this man, Kisuke, can do something, I'll wait.
There's nothing else we can do.
Uh-huh
Thank you, Ururu.
Hollows approaching!
Over here!
Escape out the back!
Ururu!
It's all right. I'll protect you.
Dammit! How long is he gonna make us wait?
Sorry to keep you waiting, boys and girls.
The charismatic medium of the new century, Don Kanonji,
at your service!
All right! I'll show you what I've got!
Me, too!
Hold it!
I am not your opponent.
Huh?!
Think about it.
Why should heroes fight each other?
Huh?
Actually, I have been thinking about starting a special troop
with kind-hearted kids who share my vision
to protect the peace of the town!
And they would be called Karakura Super Heroes!
These days in the entertainment world, it's natural for grade school kids
whove undergone rigid auditions to take active parts.
Right? And you two have potential!
Well, how about it?
Will you form a unit under me
So long-winded. and protect
This is stupid. Karakura City?
And on top of that, since you are the first two I've scouted
Guess what? The Red position is open
Red?! Red?!
RED = THE LEADER
Oh, and I forgot to mention that I intend to turn this
into a segment of my Spontaneous Trips television show.
Television?!
I'm in! I guess I have no choice.
Since it's to protect the peace in Karakura Town.
Okay! I accept your enthusiasm!
Okay, I'll be Red. Its decided.
Hey! You can't just decide like that! I'm Red! Me!
Shut up! No girl can be Red!
What?! You looking for a fight?
What a pain!
I refuse to let you be Red!
Huh? This is
Bad spirits are after your sister! It's dangerous!
Get ready for our first job!

Smells like bad spirits!
I dont think so!

What's that?!
So you've finally appeared Bad Spirit King!
It's coming this way!
Let's do it now! This is a job for the Karakura Superheroes!

No way, not at all.
Oh, I remember.
I did meet Raku before. Right?
Here
Bye bye
If I hadn't come by, Raku wouldn't have had to die.
I thought maybe youd hold a grudge against me.
But
Raku
Yuzu!
Karin!
Thank goodness!
The legendary Karakura Lion Jet,
which was summoned from our power of justice, saved you.
Huh?
Right! We summoned this amazing thing!
Hey, where'd it go?
That's right.
But it was amazing!
Secret?
All right. It'll be our secret.
What?!
Wha-?!
I'm glad. I think it was able to pass over.
Huh? Then that cat was really a ghost?
Probably, it was able to come to terms with whatever regrets it had.
I-I wasn't able to do anything for Raku
H-Hey
He said, thank you, to you just now.
Really?
I'm not sure, but a man senses these things.
Really? Really?
It's all right
Rakuthank you.
Karakura Pink, Ururu Tsumugiya.
Karakura Red, Karin Kurosaki!
Karakura Red, Jinta Hanakari!
I said I'm Red!

What's that?! What's that?!
Now everyone, follow your leader/producer!
We quit! We quit!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll always stay close to you
Now and forever
Oh, that was a nice story. Everyone, do your best!
Not! What about everyone's idol, Kon?! Whoever's responsible, come out!
No one cares about your existence.
I got new stuffing, and was waiting!
