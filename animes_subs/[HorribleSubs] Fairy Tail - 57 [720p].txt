During the battle surrounding Nirvana with Oracion Seis, Erza fell.
And then we lost Lyon...
We managed to take back the kidnapped Wendy, however...
Why is Jellal here, too?
If it's love and dreams and you it'll become magical.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
I kind of admired this powerful world,
chock-full of problems.
Frozen time has started to move again
ever since I met you.
Why were we born? Why do we live?
I don't need any complicated answers.
Laugh! Cry! Be honest with yourself.
Simple feelings are the most important.
You can change those tears shed on sad nights into strength.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
That sound...
Hey, Happy!
Darkness.
Lyon...
N-No... Lyon-sama has...
There's no way that guy's dead!
Let's search for him!
Come on!
Why?
Why did Lyon-sama have to...
Who is to blame?
I know you are here. Show yourself.
As expected from one of the Ten Great Wizard Saints.
Yes!
My magic softens the earth.
And your magic hardens the earth!
Yes!
So then, which one is stronger, yes?
Naturally, it is not the superior magic that counts,
but the one with the stronger ideals!
That is not the case.
The winner, since time immemorial,
is the one with the money, yes!
We're here!
Natsu!
How'd this happen? Suddenly a map to this place popped into my head...
Anyway, hurry and wake Wendy-chan...
Oh, right.
Wake up, Wendy!
Please, save Erza!
Calm down, Natsu!
I'm sorry! I...
I don't care about that right now!
Erza's been bitten by a poisonous snake.
Please save her! I'm begging you!
Poison?
We need Erza-san's strength to fight Oracion Seis.
Please, save Erza!
Please!
Of course! Yes, I'll do it!
Thank goodness...
How long are you going to be splayed out like that? It's unbecoming...
Aye...
I can't believe Jellal would do such a horrible thing to Erza-san...
I can't believe it...
Hmm... I can't hear this guy's thoughts.
If only I could hear his thoughts, I wouldn't have to follow him like this.
He stopped.
Where the hell is this?
There's a place like this in the Woodsea?
Could it be like Brain said? Is this where Nirvana...
Finally we've found it! Our future!
Finished. All the poison is gone from Erza-san's body.
And...?
Y'alright!
Lucy, high-five!
Thank goodness!
Carla!
Just this once.
Aye!
Wendy...
Thanks.
She might not wake up for a little while.
But she'll be fine now.
Wow... Her complexion is returning to normal.
So this is Sky Magic?
You're too close!
May I have a word?
Please refrain from using Wendy's Sky Magic any more.
As you can see, it uses up a lot of Wendy's magic power.
Don't worry about me!
Besides, I...
After Erza-san wakes up, it's time to launch a counterattack.
Yeah! We'll K.O. those Oracion Seis!
Yeah! We ain't gonna let'em have Nirvana!
What?
A pillar of black light...
Could that be...
That's...
That's... Nirvana!
We've got it! We got it!
It's... It's ours!
What the heck is that light?
Damn it... Could that be Nirvana?
Father...
T-There is no mistaking it...
Congratulations.
Those guild wizards will all be wiped out...
Father, you head toward that light.
Yes.
Is that Nirvana?
So it was awakened by Oracion Seis first?
That light...
Jellal is there!
Jellal?
Natsu!
What do you mean, Jellal?
I-I... It's all my fault...
I can't let them meet!
I can't let Erza see him!
Jellal?
What could that light be?
Good question...
Look. Something is flowing out from that eerie black tree.
It's like it's being sucked into that light.
I wonder what it means?
Maybe Nirvana is at the place where that light is!
If that's the case, that means someone already found it!
Was it the alliance? Or Oracion Seis?
Hibiki, what's happening?
Answer me, Hibiki!
That magical power must be blocking communications.
Damn it.
I'll keep searching for Wendy!
Understood. I'll head toward that light.
Be careful!
Damn it... What in the world is happening?
Whose fault was it that Lyon-sama...
Lyon!
Answer me, Lyon!
Hey!
Lyon!
His fault?
What in the world is that?
Nirvana.
Yes!
Please, do not worry.
The main body has not yet started up.
That is only the seal being released.
However, this definitely smells like money to me!
Yes!
There is no time to fight this guy, but...
But the mission is to suppress Oracion Seis...
Fight? Or stop Nirvana?
Money! Money!
Now, we will become rich!
Now what?!
We have to go after Natsu-kun!
Natsu...
Did he say something about Jellal?
I'll explain later! We have to go after Natsu!
Erza is gone!
What is with that girl?
She didn't even thank Wendy!
Erza... Maybe she heard the name Jellal, and...
What'll we do?
This is all my fault...
Because I healed Jellal, they found Nirvana, and Erza-san and Natsu-san are...
What do you think you're doing?!
Jellal!
We'll show you the power of Racer's personal guild, Harpyia!
Get'im!
Outta my way!
Move it!
I can't let him get near Erza!
I can't let'im!
Sorry for shocking you.
But all I did was knock her out.
But why? And why are we running?
We're heading after Natsu-kun and Erza-san!
We'll head toward the light as well!
I'm not buying it!
I know Wendy's a whiner, but that is no reason to treat her so roughly.
That's right!
I had no other choice.
To tell you the truth...
I know about the magic called Nirvana.
You do?
But I couldn't tell anyone its true nature.
This magic is very dangerous when you know about it consciously.
That's why Ichiya-san and even Ren and Eve don't know.
Only I was told by the Master.
What do you mean?
It's an extremely fearsome magic.
It switches light for darkness.
That's Nirvana...
Light and darkness?
It switches them?
That's the final stage.
When the seal is first released, black light rises up.
Just like that light.
First there's the black light...
The people in between the light and the darkness switch to the opposite element.
The people of light who feel powerful negative emotion...
Then the reason you put Wendy to sleep was...
It's my fault! It's because I healed Jellal!
Feeling guilt is a negative emotion, see...
At that rate, Wendy-chan might have fallen into darkness.
Wait a moment. Then, what about anger?
Natsu's in trouble!
I can't really say.
If that anger is for someone else's sake, I wouldn't necessarily call it a negative emotion...
What'll we do? I don't understand!
That's because you're an idiot.
In other words, when the seal on Nirvana is lifted,
those who are motivated by justice or evil
have their personality switched, right?
That's why I kept silent about the type of magic it was!
When people become focused on the good and evil of things,
it gives rise to unimaginable negative emotions.
If it wasn't for him...
Whose fault is it that I suffer like this?
Why is it always me?
Those thoughts will all be judged by Nirvana.
What the...
I have attacked the enemy, Lyon-sama.
Who is next?
His friends, Fairy Tail?
Money! Money! Money! Money!
What are you saying?
Money!
Yes.
I've been all frantic about my long-lost brother!
I thought... If only I had money, I could find him!
Yes.
But I have realized, I took it too far!
Yes.
So, I have decided to no longer fight!
Yes.
I will fill the world with love! Yes, love!
A word that just overflows with sweetness and compassion!
As long as there is love in this world, nothing is impossible!
Yes.
Now, let us stop the violent acts of my former allies!
I shall teach them the wonders of love!
Yes.
Um...
White Fury!
The hunt has started.
Who the hell is this guy?
My magic won't hit...
Oh? Still alive?
I'm not a nice guy.
So if Nirvana fully activates, we'll all become bad guys?
But in that case, wouldn't the people from the Dark Guilds turn into good guys?
I suppose that is possible.
But the truly fearsome power of Nirvana lies in the ability to control it that way.
For example, if you used Nirvana against a guild...
The allies could kill each other without hesitation.
They could go to war with other guilds for no reason.
Starting things like that would be child's play.
Oh, no!
We have to stop it at once!
They're going to wipe out all the light guilds!
Natsu... I think you'd be red.
Huh? What're you talkin' about?
The color that fits your image!
You use flames, so you're red.
Gray uses ice, so I guess that makes him blue.
Happy... You're givin' away your own color?
Y-You're right! W-What'll I do?
Next time: Spirit vs. Spirit!
Then how about I be something cool like black?
No... Black is totally Lucy.
She's definitely got the blackest personality in Fairy Tail!
