Hear me, humans!
I'll leave Ente Isla in your hands for now.
But I will definitely return!
And when I do, you and all of Ente Isla will be mine!
So they ran to the gate.
What now?
We must pursue.
But we don't even know
where it'll take us!
It doesn't matter which world he runs to.
He can't hide.
I will find him.
I'll find him
and kill him with my own hands!

Why are you working part-time at the MgRonald's in Hatagaya?
Hero Emilia,
why are you here?!
I followed you two through the gate
in order to kill you.
Wait, Emilia!
Let's talk this over!
There's nothing to talk about.
Prepare yourself, Overlord!
Hey, Emilia...
Silence.
I have nothing to say to you.
No, is that knife of yours
the one they sell at the 100-yen shop in Sasazuka?
A-And if it is?
What happened to your Sacred Sword?
Th-That's none of your business.
Did you lose your powers?
Or can you just not use them freely?
Look who's talking!
I can only sense some very weak magic from you.
You're a weakling compared to what you were like in Ente Isla!
Well, yeah...
I don't even need my Sacred Sword.
A powerless Overlord working part-time is no Overlord at all!
Your head is mine!
Whoops. I can't waste these valuable ingredients.
Milord sure is late...
All right, why were you two fighting?
I was trying to kill him.
Kill?
Look,
I don't know what your boyfriend did,
but you can't just whip out a blade at him.
B-Boyfriend?
He probably thinks we had a lovers' quarrel or something.
Lo
We do not have that kind of relationship!
Yeah, well, if the two of you want to break up,
talk it over with each other and handle it more peacefully, okay?
I'll spare you for tonight.
Huh?
Don't expect this to happen again.
I know where you live.
Don't expect to lead a peaceful life from tomorrow on.
That...
That doesn't sound very heroic at all.
I don't want to hear that from an overlord that flips burgers for a living!
Quiet, 100-yen Hero.
I want my umbrella back.
Didn't you tell me to toss it out?
I destroyed it and stuffed it in the trash.
What the hell?!
What kind of hero would I be if I kept the Overlord's umbrella?
Man, she's a pain in the ass...
Anyway, you'd better watch your back starting tomorrow.
She's not heroic at all.
Certainly, but first
I apologize.
You can pick from a number of options
Certainly. Thank you very much.
You just spoke to Yusa.
Aw, jeez.
There are too many complaints flowing in today.
They need to learn to RTFM!
Oh hey, wanna hit up that new curry place for lunch? It opened last week.
Hmm...
It's probably gonna be packed.
So d'you wanna give up on that and go to MgRonald's instead?
That's the last place I want to go to.
Sorry.
Crap, here's another.
Ah well, back to work.
Thank you for calling.

Air Raid! Dinner Next Door!
Let's check out this house right here!
Wow, a delicious aroma's in the air!
Methinks a feast's a'cookin'!
Ah, looks like steak's on the menu, ma'am!
Amazing! What's the occasion?
Oh my god!
No wonder this smelled great!
Get a load of this, cameraman!
You picked some great slices of meat, didn't'cha?
I bet this cost you an arm and a leg!
What?
It didn't?!
Damn it all!
I'm no different from that bastard!
I'd like some more protein.
But you eat hamburgers pretty much every day.
That the MHK?
No, they came yesterday.
A newspaper salesman, then?
They should know we can't afford a newspaper subscription by now.
Coming. Who might this be?
Who might this be?
You're being awfully polite, aren't you,
Demon General Alsiel?
You can't possibly have forgotten
the name of Emilia the Hero!
Hero Emilia?!
Come on, open up now.
Take your judgment like a man.
Hey!
It's the Hero, milord!
Did you just lock the door?!
The Hero's here!
Hey, come on! Open up!
Huh?
Oh yeah, I know.
The Overlord's in there too, isn't he?
Y-You already knew she was here?
Just give up and open this door already!
Huh?
Hey, come on!
Sorry I didn't tell you about it.
Open up now!
I ran into her on my way home from work last night.
You're gonna make me kick it open!
Are you okay with that?
I'm really gonna do it!
The cops thought it was a lovers' quarrel.
I'm being serious!
He thought you and I were a couple!
I've never been so humiliated in my life!
Open up, damn it!
Why didn't you tell me about that?
Open the door!
Nothing really happened, so I didn't think it was worth mentioning.
I'm about to go wild here! That fine with you?
Besides, I think we're all in the same boat. She couldn't use her sacred powers.
Open up!
Come on!
Does that mean the Hero has no means to harness Heaven's power in this world?
Please!
She doesn't have the power to control the gate?
Hey, let her in.
Open up...
What an awful apartment.
It's so cramped and worn out.
I could hear your voices from a mile away.
Wow, quite the harsh assessment.
The Castle Overlord places more importance on functionality than luxury!
Functionality, my ass.
And you call that dinner?
I'll have you know that Ashiya's amazing!
He creates meals from nothing.
It's like magic!
Thank you very much, milord.
You guys are retarded.
Who's ever heard of an overlord having just konjac and cucumbers for dinner?
Nothing wrong with that. We're broke.
Everything's wrong with it!
What the heck?!
Why'd I travel to another world if the guy I came to kill is already killing himself?
This is horrible!
I'm by myself, and I'm still better off than you two!
Don't you have any comrades?
Shut yer mouth!
The Head Priest was supposed to come along with me.
We were supposed to go back as soon as we killed you.
And yet...
And yet...
Hurry up, Olba! The gate's going to close!
I know!
We have to make it.
We're in, Olba!
Olba?
Oh no!
Olba!
I ended up coming here by myself.
Ain't that a shame?
I don't want your pity.
So you got lost trying to pursue us?
That's a double disaster.
Well, you'd better find a way to get back quick.
We don't have the money to move just because you found us.
That's why we're living in this kinda place.
My new world domination project will start from this Castle Overlord!
Can you even do that, you part-timer?
You're greatly mistaken if you think I'm just peacefully living a part-timer's life.
I plan to conquer Japan.
MgRonald's has a system where a part-timer can become a full-time employee!
Listen up, Emilia.
I'll become a full-timer in this world, just you see!
I'll keep piling up money and social status,
and eventually I'll have the power to make tons of people kneel before me!
Once that comes to pass, I will mount an onslaught on Ente Isla!
Ridiculous.
I don't expect a mere human to understand my lofty goals.
I think she understands it quite well.
I don't really care anymore.
I'm going home.
I've got work tomorrow, after all.
Don't take this the wrong way, though.
I can kill you any time I want with the power I have left.
Why don't you do it, then?
I can't return to Ente Isla if I use it all.
You walk until I can figure out a way to get home.
Also, my name over here is Yusa Emi.
Don't get it wrong.
Maou
Sadao
Ashiya
Shirou
But really, Sadao?
Maou
Sadao
What the heck kind of name is that?
Not the kind of name you'd give a youngster these days, don't you think?
Apologize to all the Sadaos in Japan!
Overlord at Work
Overlord at Work
Emi...
You seem kinda tense lately.
Wanna grab a bite later?
Hmm, well...
I'm kinda busy tonight, so...
Oh, did you find yourself a man?
Like hell I did!
There's no way the Overlord would quietly live an impoverished life.
I need to keep an eye on him.
Why can't you just go by yourself?
I can't do this by myself!
I need your help, milord.
We must make haste!
Stop worrying.
They'll still be there when we arrive.
You're too naive, milord!
Where could they be going at this hour?

We should get back in line afterward and buy another pack each.
That's against the rules, man.
Wanna go get some dinner tonight, Emi?
Sorry, I'm busy tonight.
Ashiya,
I'm heading out!
We don't have a second to lose!
We need to take a bloody bath!
Please wait, milord!
A bloodbath?!
Just what are they going to fight?!
We made it in time.
They should keep the bathhouse open 24/7.
The first thing I do after I conquer Japan
is build a 24-hour bathhouse.
You'll come with me tonight, right?
Huh? Uh...
Plans again?!
S-Sorry...
So your boyfriend comes before your girlfriend, huh?
I told you it's not like that.
Please stop, milord.
Maou
Sadao
But I can't stop thinking about this demonic experiment!
Demonic, my ass! What's with this foolish
Whoa, it's true!
Chiho was right!
You have a bite too!
It tastes kinda like melons!
Like hell it does!
You can put honey on a cucumber, but it's still a cucumber.
I should just go home.
Listen up, milord.
Only people with leeway can eat like this.
Don't you have any leeway in your heart?
Why are you twisting my words?!
Look, if you're going to put honey on cucumbers to get the taste of melons,
just go buy some melons!
What now?
An earthquake?
Don't change the topic!
Jeez, what's with you?
Stop saying jeez! You're Satan!
Milord!
Mind if I have a bit of your time?
Have you decided on your order?
I need to talk to you outside.
Okay, so you'd like your meal to go.
See me at that intersection once you're off work.
You don't have the right to refuse.
Would you like a combo meal?
Come alone.
Just a burger, then? Certainly.
One Filet-O-Fish, please!
I don't plan on fighting you,
so make sure to show up.
Thank you!
Please step to your left and await your order.
What a pain in the ass.
That was one weird customer, right?
Well, there are all sorts of people in this world.
It seemed like you were having a conversation.
Was she an acquaintance?
Yeah...
We kinda have a weird relationship.
What?!
That sounds fishy!
What does?
Yeah, she sure was pretty, right?!
Right, Maou?
Right?!
I heard you the first time.
What's with you, Chiho?
What does it matter if she and I
I think I'd like...
Go ahead.
See ya later, Maou.
All right. Good work, Chiho.
Good work
Maou!
Yeah?
Were you all right during yesterday's earthquake?
Earthquake?
Oh yeah, there was one...
Looked like my roommate didn't notice it, though.
You have a roommate?!
Why do you ask?
I didn't know you had a roommate.
No, why'd you ask about the earthquake?
Huh? Y-Yeah...
My house was hit pretty hard.
When I got home from school,
I saw that my books and CDs were all over the floor.
What?
It wasn't that big an earthquake, though.
That's the thing.
I asked my friends at school about it,
but for some reason, only my place was affected that badly.
By the way, Maou!
Y-Yeah?
You said something about a roommate earlier.
Y-Yeah...
Do you mean you're l-l-living together with your girlfriend?
Nah, I'm living a broke-ass life with my trusted subordina
With an old friend of mine.
Oh, is that so?
That's a relief.
What is?
So, what did you want to talk about?
I thought I'd ask you a question.
Do you want to keep living in this world forever?
Huh?
Of course not.
What the hell are you talking about?
I've watched how you live your life these past few days.
What are you, a stalker?
You committed no sins.
You just passed your days living a simple and honest life.
Your boss and coworkers trust you,
and you can deal with the customers confidently and flexibly.
You're pretty much the ideal MagD employee.
It's not MagD.
I almost dismissed your rant the other day as nonsense,
but I'm starting to think you were actually serious back then.
If you'll live out your life in this world,
I won't have to kill you.
Stay here in Sasazuka for the rest of your life.
Do you enjoy telling two guys to live together for the rest of their lives?
Give up on Ente Isla
and find yourself a new life here.
Not happening.
I will definitely return to conquer Ente Isla.
Whoa!
Pathetic.
Oh no! A flat tire!
Is this guy really the Overlord?
Get ahold of yourself, Dullahan!
Don't die right after I bought you!
You're making a mountain out of a molehill.
You can get it fixed for just a thousand yen.
Really?!
Then I'll get it done first thing in the morning
Is someone...
It opened up holes on that signboard!
Hey, get your hands off me!
This is no time to be fighting amongst ourselves!
You're pretty good.
Who do you think I am?
I'm a Hero.
Could you get off me, then?
You're the one who got underneath me!
There should still be quite a lot of people near Sasazuka Station.
Can you run?
I'm sure I can run faster than someone who rides a bike every day.
Those're fightin' words.
Let's go!
I think they stopped chasing us.
What on Ente Isla was that?
No clue,
but that was no ordinary sniper.
Those were magic energy bullets.
Magic?! That means...
It was someone considerably powerful
and who knew our true identities.
Does someone like that even exist?
What are the chances of there being a mysterious sniper right where the Overlord and the Hero were meeting?
It obviously had something to do with Ente Isla.
This is all your fault.
My fault?!
This wouldn't've happened if you'd picked a better time and place.
It's not my fault you work all night!
Couldn't we have just met during the day?
I have work during the day!
And that's my problem how?
Wait,
where are you going?
Home.
I've got work early tomorrow.
So you're going to run away all by yourself?
Obviously.
You be careful on your way home, too.
Later.
Are you
planning on taking me down in the dead of night or something?
Th-That's not it.
What is, then?
My landlord lives right next door.
I'd like to avoid meeting her if possible,
so please don't make a ruckus.
Wh-What's wrong?
I resent having to ask this of you.
I'm betraying the world by doing this.
Did you come here just to provoke me?
Could you let me st
Huh?
St- Stay over tonight?
St-Stay over tonight?
St-Stay over tonight?
I dropped my purse.
Hero Emilia?!
Relax.
She doesn't have the will to fight us right now.
What are you saying?
I've never heard of an Overlord bringing a Hero over late at night!
The two of us were attacked earlier.
We were shot at with magic energy bullets.
Magic?
She says she dropped her purse while running away.
She lives in Eifukucho.
It's too far away to walk there on foot.
Does that mean you're going to let her stay the night?
Come on.
Don't just stand there. Come in.
Th-Thanks.
Have a seat wherever.
Just so you know,
we don't have an extra bed for guests.
Well, obviously.
Is that how you're going to repay milord's compassion?!
Pipe down, Ashiya.
You're going to make the landlord show up.
Use this, Emi.
You use the same detergent as I do.
Use those magazines over there if you want a pillow.
I'll lend you a thousand yen,
so get lost when the trains start operating again.
Okay.
Milord just lent you a thousand yen from what little we have left!
Don't waste it!
I know already!
I'll leave first thing in morning.
Thank you so much.
You ungrateful wench...
Let's hit the sack too.
Yessir.
I have not let my guard down!
Don't you dare try anything funny.
What am I even doing here?
We felt pretty damn hopeless when we first got here, right?
Indeed.
We had each other, so we got by.
She's all alone, though.
How soft you've gotten, milord.

What the heck?
Oh, I've got one from Chiho too.
