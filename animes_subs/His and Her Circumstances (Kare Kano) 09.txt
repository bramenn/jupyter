What's happened so far!
Our sister, the masked model student Miyazawa Yukino...
Arima, the one who changed her...
tries to bear all his sorrows by himself.
They were affected by each other's lives,
and after repeated fuss, established a relationship.
They decided to live solely for their
own real happiness from that point forward.
But the world isn't that simple or generous.
It forced them to become super-busy, as though challenging their relationship...
Starting with the school event which made them
not see each other: the Athletics Festival.
In order to carry his ambition of
the Asaba Mary-Land Project...
This delinquent, perverted hunk, is Asaba Hideaki.
Their final exam grades
were the result of yielding
to their love-power and goofing off.
Sis's one-sided feeling of estrangement occurred because of this.
And on top of it all,
there was interference and pressure from the teachers at school.
And so on,
the various difficulties continued
to rise to impede them.
Go for it, Miyazawa Yukino!
Don't lose heart, Arima Souichirou!
This world exists for you! But... however!
Hey, did you hear?
About Arima and Miyazawa?
Their grades really slid at finals.
Yeah, yeah.
Aren't they going out?
They got called into the
Student Guidance Room and got lectured.
Whoa!
What's more...I hear they rebelled
against the teachers...and their parents got called in to school!
No way, for real?!
I wonder what happened to them?
Yeah.
I'm so sleepy.
I'm still feeling last night's all-nighter.
There was this one math problem I just couldn't solve.
I wonder what I'm doing wrong?
I've been thinking about it ever since...
Miyazawa!
Is Home Ec. this afternoon in sewing room 1 in the old building?
Yeah.
Whatcha looking at?
Oh, Math?
Yeah... there's this one problem I just can't figure out.
Wow, that even happens to you, Miyazawa?
Oh, there's something I didn't understand, either.
Can I ask you about it?
Sure, if I know how to solve it.
I'm just not
one of the girls, am I?
I talk with everybody,
but there's none of them whom I'm really close to.
It's been a long time since I stopped playing the model student...
Well, it can't be helped.
That's how I was until now.
Others can't adjust
if you suddenly become normal.
Arima!
Math?
Which problem?
This one.
Hey! Asama-kun!
What're you doing? Let's go have lunch.
What the hell?!
I was wondering why you weren't coming and here you are playing with the babes?!
I'm not like you.
Disgusting! You sex fiend!
I said I'm not like you.
You made me wait out in the blazing sun at the entryway all this time!
So why didn't you just wait in the hall?
You meanie! You're always so mean to me!
Sorry to stop in the middle...
I'll take my time to explain later, okay?
Oh...
Um...
Sure...Th...those three really get along well.
Yeah, they're always with each other.
It sure is different once you start going out.
Arima's always been nice,
but he was never especially friendly with the girls...
Oh, let's go have lunch, too.
Ok, want to go to the mini-mart afterwards?
Sounds great!
Hey, have you heard about
the legend of the kendo club?
Huh, what's that? Never heard of it.
Our kendo club's really strong...
So all schools would cheer
for their own teams, right?
But whenever it was Arima's turn
they start cheering for our school! *Go Hokuei! Go Hokuei!*
That's awesome!
But I can totally see why!
A hot guy comes before school spirit!
I hear all the girls in 1-F went with Asaba to Disneyland!
WHAT?
How lucky! No fair!
Arima and Asaba sure get along well.
They're so picturesque when they stand next to each other.
They're like the valiant hunk
and the delinquent hunk.
Miyazawa's really lucky,
being friends with those two.
Naturally, when she's so perfect.
I bet I could make friends with those two.
She's pretty and kind, and not arrogant about being smart...
And always helps us with everything so nicely.
I guess perfect people really exist.
I don't know.
Maho...
Is Miyazawa really as nice a person as you all say she is?
Couldn't it be that you're all just being deceived?
What?
What're you talking about, Maho?!
I always thought that girl was fishy.
So perfect at anything she does.
Isn't she just a brown noser?
What?
I don't know.
But her attitude's changed lately.
Maybe she's slipping and showing her true nature.
What?
Really?
But don't you think Miyazawa's
different from before?
Kii, you think so, too?
Actually, I was thinking the same thing!
No way! Me, too!
Me, too!
What? So everyone was thinking that way?
There are women like that, you know...
People like that are good at catching guys, too.
Guys are suckers for that type.
Doesn't it look like she chose well by getting both Arima and Asaba?
If...If that's true,
I can't put up with it.
Yeah.
There were lots of girls who liked Arima and Asaba.
If this is true, we can't forgive her.
That's right!
I know lots of girls who tried
and failed to tell them they liked them.
I feel sorry for them!
We were able to suck it up
because she was so perfect...
How could she deceive us?
If that's how it is,
I'd rather have them be taken by somebody else!
This looks like it's going to be fun.
I'm late.
This is the right room...
Why isn't anyone here?
Something's wrong. I'll try asking the teachers.
So sewing was canceled
and became study hall?
I went to the classroom,
and I was surprised that no one was there.
I couldn't figure it out,
so I went and asked the teachers.
Huh?
Oh, I know.
Want to go back to doing that math problem?
No, we got it already.
You stopped getting it because all you do is fool around with guys.
Oh. I see.
Did you see Miyazawa's face?
She turned so pale, the poor thing.
She's had it so good up until now,
she should suffer a bit.
Really, she stands out too much...
Her looks sure aren't anything to write home about.
You're much prettier, Maho.
You should rule the whole class again,
just like in junior high.
You were so cool, Maho!
I guess.
Miyazawa?
Hm?
What's wrong? You look upset.
No, I just didn't get enough sleep.
Should I do the rest?
I'm fine, don't worry.
I can guess why this happened.
It's because I'm friends with Arima and Asaba...
This is what I get for deceiving people all this time.
It's no wonder they hate me.
The karma for deceiving them without any desire for making friends...
ALL RIGHT! The time for feeling sorry is OVER!
Nothing's going to get done if I keep brooding.
There's no use crying over spilt milk.
I should at least take it with dignity.
After all, this is the real beginning for the real me!
I have nothing to do.
It's been several days since they started ignoring me.
This was a sudden fall from the glory I had previously attained.
Almost like a politician after his downfall.
But that's unavoidable.
When I exposed the fact that I wasn't elegant or perfect without hiding it...
I knew it was risky.
But I didn't want to live in pretense anymore.
I have to climb over this wall myself.
So I thought, but...
With them all ignoring me so completely,
I don't have any cards to play with...
I can't figure out where to begin fixing things.
She's so pretty!
I didn't know there was anyone like that in our school.
I wonder why I never noticed?
Hi, Tsubasa. Did you go to the teachers' offices?
I met her.
What? Who?
Miyazawa Yukino.
Oh, the one going out with Arima?
She didn't look so hot.
Why does Arima want someone like her?
I bet it's because she's intellectual.
Arima's not some dummy who'd pick a girl just for her looks.
SHUT UP! I didn't ask you to reach a conclusion!
Ooh, scary.
This certainly wasn't in my plans.
I get hospitalized right after getting into high school...
Arima's got a girlfriend.
What about my feelings, after I've cared for Arima all this time?
I'll crush them.
Huh?
I'll crush them!
I don't care what dirty tricks I have to use!
I'LL DESTROY THEM!
Miyazawa.
It's that pretty girl I ran into earlier.
Oh, you haven't met before. I'll introduce you.
This is Shibahime from 1-D.
We were in the same junior high.
She's been hospitalized for a long time.
She came back to school the day before yesterday.
Arima, this is the first time I've ever seen you being this familiar with a girl.
This is Miyazawa. We're going out.
Nice to meet you. I'm Shibahime Tsubasa.
Oh, hi. I'm Miyazawa Yukino.
What are you going? Miyazawa?
I don't know. Miyazawa suddenly slapped my hand away.
Her notebooks...
Shibahime!
Miyazawa...
Miyazawa pushed me down!
How could she? Why would she do such a thing?
Oh, a cat.
Shibahime, what're you doing?!
What were you trying to do?! Huh?!
Why're you doing this?!
Ow ow owww... I didn't do anything!
Liar!
There's no way Miyazawa would do something like that!
Sorry, Miyazawa.
She wouldn't normally do stuff like this...
You okay?
And you, come over here and apologize.
There's a limit to how far you can go with pranks.
Yeah yeah, I'm SO very very sorry.
Oh, don't worry about it.
But you were in the hospital for a long time, weren't you?
Isn't it bad for you if you move around like that?
Um, kind of...
She crashed into a stone wall on her skateboard...
But if she can move around this much, she's probably fine.
In junior high, everyone envied me.
Because Arima was especially friendly to me alone.
You skipped out on clean-up again, didn't you?
I know you did!
Oh, it's all right.
I'm cute, so they'll do it for me.
I swear, you're hopeless.
Don't look at somebody else like that.
Don't belong to someone like that. Don't go.
Oh, I know.
If you've been hospitalized for so long, I bet classes are rough.
I still have some copies of the study guides...
Why you little...!
Humph! Mind your own business!
All you do is suck up to your girlfriend!
You sure have changed!
Quit lecturing me like you know everything!
Why don't you just go and curl up in your girlfriend's lap?
Don't ever speak to me again, it's too embarassing! Bah-bye!
What the heck's wrong with her?
I see... she likes Arima...
And here I thought it would be nice to see Shibahime again...
What the heck was she so upset about?
He's so dense...
Sorry, Miyazawa.
Looks like I've caused you some trouble...
But I've cared about Shibahime for a long time.
I thought, if I had a sister, she'd be like her.
I know he only thought of me like a sister.
That was just fine.
Until he fell in love with someone else.
You bit off more than you could chew.
There there.
It can't be helped.
Arima never saw Tsubasa as a potential love interest.
So what?
She can still monopolize Arima that way.
There's no use now.
Arima's feelings totally belong to that girl.
He won't pay attention to me any more.
Don't be such a chicken...
I can't stand it! I hate her!
Gack! Tsubasa!
Tsubasa, what're you doing?!
Tsubasa...
Is she a demon of revenge?
You don't even know a thing about Arima!
Tsubasa...
Shibahime totally hates me.
Ignored by all the girls in my class, hated by Shibahime...
I'm really not doing so hot these days...
Miyazawa?
Sorry for all the trouble Shibahime's causing.
We're her friends...
Please understand her feelings.
It's really complicated for her.
Oh, sure. I don't mind.
She hasn't done anything that bad to me... I'm okay.
What a relief to hear you say that.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Anyway, we'll try to keep her out of trouble,
so please don't be offended.
If anything happens, just let us know.
Bye bye. See ya.
Bye bye.
Lucky...that girl has friends.
Hey, how long are we going to keep doing this?
What, are you siding with Miyazawa?
Laughter, Fury, Anxiety, Love, Friendship
Rivalry, Gowth and Degeneration
Within the doors of the classroom...
What'll happen next!
Surrounded by enemies...
as they appear one after the other.
But the deadlock comes to an end.
Yes, Shibahime Tsubasa goes
in for the kill!
Everything Starts Now.
