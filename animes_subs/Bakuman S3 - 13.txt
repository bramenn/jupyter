They don't simply steal people's things.
And they don't simply cause trouble for others!
Azuki?
Azuki Miho
Good morning
I saw the news
Willl PCP be okay?
If I worried about stuff like that,
Good morning
I wouldn't be able to draw manga!
Everything'll be fine!
Even if you're fine, what about Takagi?
Azuki Miho
Good morning
Even if you're fine,
what about Takagi?
I think he's more
fragile than you are. He's the
I think he's more fragile than you are.
one who comes up with the
story, after all...
He's the one that comes up with the story, after all.
Shuujin's more fragile?
PCP will be okay, right?
I haven't heard anything from the editing department.
So probably...
Today's Sunday!
Oh, right.
It's on another channel too!
what about Takagi?
I think he's more
fragile than you are. He's the
one who comes up with the story
ano ne moshimo ima sugu ni kimi no moto he to
Hey, if I could go to where you are right now
ikeru naraba kono koe ga nakunattemo ii ya
then I could accept losing my voice
mezasu basho ga amari ni mo tooku
The goals I've set myself seem impossible to reach,
boku wa mou michi ni mayoisou da
and I feel lost on my path
kowareta jishaku wo ate ni shiteru n da
I'm relying on a broken compass and hiding in another's shadow
dareka no kage ni kakurete sa
If we keep letting go of some things in order to find something else,
then I'm convinced we can never grow up
tsuzukete mo kitto bokura wa otona ni wa narenai

Never
Imitation and Subconscious
Have you talked to Ashirogi yet?
If it's about yesterday's incident,
I think it's best not to bring it up.
If we want them to think that the editing department doesn't consider it a problem,
then we shouldn't raise the subject.
If they ask us, we should just laugh it off.
Indeed, we shouldn't show them a nervous reaction.
But in these cases, we need to consider the authors' mental state above all else.
Don't forget that.
Yes, sir.
I think it'll be fine.
Those two won't let something like this get them down.
I hope not.
All right, the manuscript is good.
You've wrapped up the two-chapter Valentine arc well.
So, let's have our meeting about the next chapter.
Right.
Um, Hattori.
Is it okay to keep doing what we've been doing?
Is this about that bank robbery?
In PCP, you had them say that they shouldn't do it, because it would inconvenience the bank and the security company.
There's no problem.
The editing department is even protesting some of these news stories.
R-Really?
Yeah. Just continue on as normal.
Like I've said before, it's best if Makoto and the rest carry out perfect crimes that are as realistic as possible.
Enough so that kids want to copy them.
It's like he says.
We can't shrink back from this.
Yeah.
PCP is not a manga that promotes crimes.
The purpose is to enjoy the schemes, strategies, and tricks devised by the main characters.
Like I said before, we've received letters and calls of protest from the beginning.
But it's brushed past those and become a popular manga.
It's proof that the readers understand it.
With this incident, our chances of an anime are completely gone.
How is it? The White White Day Plot?
Yeah, it's good.
I'll make it into a storyboard.
What a relief.
What is it, Mashiro?
Hattori, are you still at work?
Yeah.
Takagi finished his story, but there's something that concerns me.
Concerns you?
What do you mean?
I'll fax it to you. Can you take a look at it?
I see.
It is a bit different than everything he's done before.
Yeah. I think the incident is affecting him after all.
But it could be that since we're worrying about that as we read this, we'll inevitably draw that conclusion.
Let's see how it goes, and if this trend continues, we'll think about it then.
You're right.
I understand.

Welcom
My manga's about to get an anime.
Yeah, I know.
I'm looking to increase my staff by one.
I need someone skilled.
If you need a fresh start, you can come work for me.
Fukuda,
just let me be.
Damn.
Why... Why am I like this?
Really, Hiramaru?
Really, really!
That can't be true.
Aoki!
Get out here, bitch!
Nakai?
Nakai?!
Aoki, it's all your fault!
Get out here!
I know you're in there!
Yuri, I'm coming over now.
Aoki!
Buy some time!
Come out!
Okay.
Aoki... how long are you going to make me wait?
Nakai!
I won't let you lay a finger on Yuri!
Hi-ra-ma-ru!
Bring it on!
Hiramaru!
Aoki!
No, Yuri! Don't come outside!
Get out of my way!
Aoki, I'm coming up right now! Wait right there!
Don't get involved with Aoki anymore!
Shut up!
It's all her fault!
If it weren't for her...
You're just using her as a scapegoat.
Wh-What?!
I've heard the rumors.
Didn't you fail as a manga author...
because you weren't dedicated enough?
Aoki and her beauty aren't at fault.
Therefore, I'll stake my life on protecting her.
Now, come and knock me around until you're satisfied.
You...!
Stop this at once!
There's no reason for you to hit Hiramaru.
No, Yuri, this is a man-to-man thing
If you need to hit someone, hit me.
That's what you want the most, right?
Now, hit me until you're satisfied.
I know I'm just using you as an excuse.
I didn't have anything other than manga!
I staked my entire life on it!
When hideout door was in serialization, I was so happy.
I lost that, and now I've got nothing left.
Even if I accept it's my own fault, there's nothing else I want to do.
I don't know how I'm going to live from now on.
Nakai!
Being a manga author is a scary thing.
Editors lead you on and then step on you.
I don't know what my future will bring.
In five or ten years... who knows what will have become of me?
Won't you be an assistant at my place?
You may be my future self!
When I think that way, I can't let you be.
Hiramaru...
Before, when you said you'd protect Aoki with your life,
I thought maybe it was okay to entrust her to you.
I see. Thanks!
That sounded kind of arrogant, but thanks!
Seems it was a drunken brawl.
Looks like they made up at the end.
What time do they think it is?
I heard they were in the care of the police for the night.
So, for whatever reason, Nakai is now Hiramaru's assistant.
Jeez. What is Nakai doing?
Tell Yoshida to keep a close eye on him, okay?
You're 8th in this week's ranking.
8th?!
We were always in the top five...
It's the White Day chapter, right?
That's right.
Why?
You don't know?
Since that chapter, you haven't let PCP commit anything close to a perfect crime.
No way!
I've been doing everything normally!
Are you sure?
Of course!
Then you've been subconsciously writing less objectionable material.
Even if you don't think so yourself,
your head is doing it for you.
I think so, too.
There's been a definite change in this past month of scripts.
I understand.
This time, consciously,
I'll write something I don't want anyone imitating.
And I'll revise everything I can!
Akito?
It looks like my cold's made a comeback, so I'm going to bed.
What's wrong?
If we had a kid,
and they imitated PCP,
you wouldn't be okay with it, would you?
I'd raise them so that they could decide for themselves what's okay to imitate and what isn't.
That's right.
You're right, Kaya.
Good night.
Good night.
You've been steady at 2nd place lately.
Keep up the good work.
Well, I got the manuscript, so I'll go now.
Yuujirou.
What's the difference in votes between 1st and 2nd place?
Um, more than fifty votes, I think.
Fifty, huh.
I see.
What is it?
You've never asked about the survey
My next storyboard
may be a little bit late.
Late?
Yes.
Well, you're usually early, so that shouldn't be
This won't be usual.
It'll be a storyboard that will get 1st place.
In order for me to move to the city, I have one condition.
Condition?
If I ever become the most popular author in Jack,
give me the right to end one manga I hate.
He couldn't...
G-Get 1st place?
Yes.
I'll get 1st.
Hello?
Mashiro, do you have the storyboard yet?
We're running low on time.
Sorry, Takagi hasn't yet...
Saikou, how's this?
T-Takagi just brought in the script.
I see. I'm coming over.
Okay, this is fine.
Mashiro, make it into a storyboard.
Right.
I'm so glad.
Are you okay, Takagi?
You seem exhausted.
I'm okay.
I kept a stock of two chapters written ahead of time, but I've used them up completely.
I'll write more at home.
Are you okay with not having a meeting?
I have a rough idea, so I'll show it to you when I'm done.
Hattori.
This story was one that Takagi had rejected before.
And the fact that he brought it out again
must mean that he's at his wits end.
I see.
I gave my approval, but I didn't sense the brilliance I felt before.
If I explain the circumstances, I can get you guys a week off
I don't want to do that.
He wouldn't want that, either.
I'll make up for any delay!
PCP's in 12th.
We never had double digit rankings before, and now we have them three weeks in a row.
Yuujirou, CROW is doing really well!
This week, there were less than 20 votes separating it from 1st place.
Don't you think it might hit 1st place soon?
Maybe.
What's wrong?
Why are you looking so down when your manga is doing so well?
You haven't been looking so happy lately, either.
I have a reason PCP is in a slump.
Hattori, want to get a coffee?
What?!
The right to end a manga he hates?!
Quiet down!
Only the Chief and I know. Don't tell anyone!
Right.
I wish he had never taken interest in the survey.
I'm starting to take this seriously now.
Of course, even if he gets 1st place, that doesn't necessarily make him the best author in Jack.
Would Niizuma, being a fan of Ashirogi, decide PCP wasn't worth reading anymore and end it?
How is it?
It's not bad.
This week's initial rankings must be out already.
Please tell us.
Right now, PCP is 11th.
And CROW will most likely take the top spot this week.
Even though it's too early to tell, there's quite a gap between 1st and 2nd.
Saikou! Tell me straight out.
Is this story any good?!
I don't think so.
You're just rehashing ideas that you've used before.
But it's well constructed as a chapter.
You have no more time.
This time, you
Shuujin, are you really okay with this?
Mashiro.
You're stretching the schedule to the limit.
You need time for your art
If Takagi can do it,
it's no trouble for me to pull three all-nighters in a row!
Okay!
I'll go home and keep writing!
Until I have something Mashiro agrees with!
Takagi!
Takagi's at his limit.
I know.
But even if it takes him till the very last minute,
Takagi will write a story we can both agree on,
and I'll draw the best possible art.
We'll both put forth our best effort and back each other up.
That's Ashirogi Mutou.
Saikou believes in me, and is waiting for me.
I'll definitely do it.
For him.
For Ashirogi Mutou!
This time, the letter left in the bank was signed
PCP , the same as the group of protagonists
from the manga PCP: Perfect Crime Party serialized in Weekly Shounen Jack.
We got into
the vault
The police suspect the same culprits that were behind the bank break-in incident a while ago...
We got into
the vault
Awful.
Hattori, you'd better be supporting Ashirogi!
Tell them there's nothing to worry about!
Right!
How's Takagi doing?
I haven't heard from him yet.
I see.
He took so much mental damage from the first incident.
I know you don't want to do this,
but you should consider taking a break.
Shuujin...
At the very least, we can say for sure that the culprit has read this manga, correct?
I have to write the scripts.
That's absolutely correct.
You could call this a copycat crime.
Akito!
Akito!
Maybe you should ask Mashiro if it's okay to take the day off today.
Leave me alone.
But...
You should at least eat some
I said leave me alone!
Right now, PCP is 11th.
And CROW will probably take the top spot this week.
Dammit!
Dammit!

It's Mashiro.
The person you are trying to reach is not available at this time.
Please call back
So he's depressed enough to ignore my calls.
Takagi Kaya
Refuse
Calling
Forward
What's wrong, Kaya?
Sorry, Mashiro.
Akito's not in a state of mind where he can answer the phone.
He saw the news and left right away to write... and told me to leave him alone.
Kaya...
I've never seen him so scary!
When he said Leave me alone,
I couldn't do anything!
Will he be okay?
It's all this bank robber's fault!
Why did he have to sign as PCP?!
PCP would never do such a thing!
Of course they wouldn't!
PCP wouldn't do that
I get it...
Dammit!
Dammit!
Dammit!
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!
Dammit!
Shuujin.
So it was you, Rokudzuka.
You stole the textbooks from everyone and hid them in the gym storage room.
Hmph! Of course you got caught.
PCP wouldn't have hidden them in such a place.

Akechi...
when did you realize that I was the culprit, and not PCP?
Akechi... when did you realize that I was the culprit, and not PCP?
You put out a notice of intent to steal. If it had gone successfully, it would look like PCP had done it, and you'd have been gloating over your copycat crime.
Hmph!
I knew from the beginning that it wasn't PCP.

As planned, we got Akechi to burst his bubble.

Well, Akechi knew it wasn't PCP right away.
Why?
If you break the law, you're just a criminal.
Anyone can break the law, but nobody can copy us!

Oh! Makoto's super awesome!
This week's PCP is really cool.
You jumped right up to 3rd!
Writing about a copycat criminal was the right thing to do.
We received many fan letters from people expressing their relief.
PCP isn't a manga that promotes crime.
In order to make people understand what kind of manga it is,
we should make a story about copycat criminals and reject crime.
Takagi and I both had that same idea.
You two suit each other perfectly, as always.
But I did cause Mashiro a lot of grief.
I'm sorry.
The schedule for the art must have been pretty tough.
That's Ashirogi Mutou, right?
Niizuma is 1st again this week.
That's Eiji for you. The gap between us has widened again.
Yeah. But no matter how far apart we get...
Yeah!

Niizuma said something outrageous!
I don't want to do something that isn't cool.
But this is too extreme!
Next time: Serialization and Prevention.
