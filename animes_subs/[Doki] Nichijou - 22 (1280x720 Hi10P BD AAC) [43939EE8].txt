Hey!
( !)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
All right! I'll say it!
You are my best, best friend!
(Fly!) When I joke around a bit,
(Shine!) You joke around more in response.
(La La La) Nothing is better than this!
(Why!) Even if something bad happens,
(Fine!) I immediately forget about it!
(La La La)
Always keep it going!
Being together 24 hours a day isn't a problem.
Just like twins, or a parent and child, or clone cyborgs.
Then isn't there no reason to clear your eyes?
Those are completely, completely different issues.
(Fight!) Even when I get in a fight with you,
(Down!) even when I get really down,
(Shy!) even when I feel like I want to be alone,
before I realise it, you're right there; we'll be together even in death!
I wonder why it is.
I want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
time goes 100 times faster!
It's fun, isn't it?
It's way too fun!
As expected of my best friend!
What is it?
The synchro is amazing!
Always making an uproar,
bothering the neighbours a lot.
What time is it now?
And then yo de le hi hoo!
I don't get it at all!
So re doh si la!
It's better than I imagined, the absolute best!
Even if I say this and that, we're still friends. (Hooray!)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
Cha Cha La Cha La Cha Cha!
I respect and owe a great deal to my teachers
Many years have passed in this garden of learning
These months and years have gone by quickly
Now is the time to part, farewell

Narration: Shibata Hidekatsu
Everything in this world can be proven by science.
In the world there are talks about the so-called spiritual phenomena...
There's no way those kinds of sleep-inducing things could be real!
It'd be bad if they were.
In other words...
I don't believe in spirits!
I heard that exorcisms were being performed at a local temple, so I went to check it out.
So, what brings you here?
First, I'll pretend I'm possessed by a demon,
then I'll look for contradictions.
Lately, I've been having the feeling of something tightening around my throat.
Oh my!
Here.
Use this.
Here it comes!
The offering of useless exorcism goods!
It should work really well on your throat.
He's being awfully reasonable.
Is there not enough reality in my story?
Well, then I'll need to get him to believe me.
You see,
it's not just that my throat is sore...
It feels like I'm being strangled by someone,
and I think I heard a strange voice.
I'm possessed by something!
Well, isn't it that...
You shouldn't...
I never would have thought that someone in the business would tell me that.
More importantly, does this priest even believe in spirits?
But I came all this way to the temple.
There's no way I'm just going to back down!
I'm being strangled by some sort of monster!
Excuse me!
He saw through me!
Of course he did.
I was wrong for trying to fool someone in the business with a half-assed performance!
I have to do it seriously.
To get him to believe,
I need to go mad!
W-What?!
W-What are you doing?!
What the heck are you doing?!
What the heck are you doing?!
What in the world is this?!
Why you...
What are you doing...
What are you doing to my temple?!
My dream is to become a scientist.
Crap.
I seem to have lost myself.
To explain everything in this world with science...
And when that time comes, there is one thing I want to express.
Are you okay?
Get...
Get out, you demon!
A person can become a demon at any time.
Gotcha!
Who is it?!
Mihoshi, it's been a while.
Oh, it's Naganohara-san!
I haven't seen you for a while.
You're already a middle schooler, huh?
Well, lately, you haven't been coming to the dojo at all.
I haven't gone to practise at my university lately, either.
I've been skipping!
And yet you still won the National Tournament?
This darn genius type!
Are you going to the dojo now?
Yeah.
Clubs just ended, so I'm going now.
Naganohara-san, are you coming?
I'm the type that gets weaker when I practise a lot.
What is she saying?
This darn genius type!
Although I can accept that she's strong,
I can't accept that she's strong despite never practising.
It's been rumoured that when Naganohara-san was in middle school, she scored a point against the Master!
That legendary master!
I'm a middle schooler now, too, but I can't seem to do anything.
I go to the dojo after club,
and I spend my entire weekend practising.
The Master says that effort will always open up a door!
Oh, a black cat!
Hey, kitty!
When I look at her, I start to feel uneasy.
You're so cute!
I'll take a swing.
Just one.
In this situation, even I can...
This is the most I can do right now,
but someday I'll do it in a match.
I'll do it against the Master someday, too!
This darn genius type!
Oh, sorry!
Master!
It's cold.
Got it?
Be sure to do it right.
Dad intends to pass the business on to me.
Also, take this balloon.
If a kid comes around, hand it to him.
I won't stand for this.
As soon as I see a chance, I'm running for it!
But you know...
This thing...
It isn't floating!
In the very end, I just want a little bit of a happy ending.
What are you going to ask Santa for, Professor?
Well, I want some chocolate,
some coloured pencils,
a cake-shaped eraser and...
Wow!
Having that many isn't fair!
Well, what I would like is...
Two packs of eggs, 500 grams of beef, a book and...
I've already asked for a lot, so you only get one thing, Nano!
Nano, if it's only a little more, then I guess it's okay.
I'll let you borrow this, too.
Bobon!
Yay, it's Santa!
Merry Christma -
I'm not sticking around for this!
I need to hurry up and get this off!
Ow! It hurts!
Are you going to run away, Tsuyoshi?
Dad!
I made some modifications to the mask.
Modifications?
The inside of that mask...
Hot!
Damn, I dropped my meat bun!
I didn't even get to take a bite out of it...
It's fine, Websey!
If there had been poison in that meat bun, you would have died,
so it's actually a good thing!
No, it isn't!
It's what I look forward to the most on the way home from school...
You need to always look forward. Your luck will come back.
Be thankful to the fallen meat bun.
What's with your extremely positive attitude?
I've decided to always be positive, even in tough times!
Look, if you take off the dirty parts, you can still eat it.
The poison is already gone?
See? You do it like this -
Hot!
The popsicle is safe!
See?
Good things happen when you're positive.
It's positive magic!
My meat bun isn't safe, though...
It's times like this you need to be positive!
If there had been poison in the meat bun,
you would have died, Websey.
You don't have much variation.
Even if I remove the parts that got dirty,
I can't accept the fact that some popsicle juice got on it.
Come on! Positive thinking -
Oh, god!
The heat from the meat bun must have made it a bit loose.
If I imagine that there was poison in the popsicle, I can handle this...
You were eating so much of it, though.
What is it?
Your positiveness just had its combo broken!
No, this is a message from God that I shouldn't eat two because I might get a stomach ache!
That's some Fecchan-like perseverance!
Also, if this had been soft serve, it would be completely out.
I can just wash off this popsicle.
I'm thankful for that!
You're still going to eat that?
Wait!
What's it like?
It's like it's wet.
Come on, Fecchan!
Positive, positive!
Oh, I give up!
If you refuse to inherit my legacy,
just wait for my second and third traps!
Dad...
This...
You...
Could it be?!
Tachibana, what are you going to do in the future?
I'm deciding between going to a university or getting into cooking.
Cooking, huh?
Marry him?!
Calm down, Tachibana.
Tie it like this,
and it's done.
I'm back!
Oh, Nano, I'm going to take Sakamoto out for a walk.
I'm going to have some friends over to study, is that all right?
Okay.
I want to play, too, so I'll be right back.
Well then, I'm off!
Hey! What are you doing, kid?!
I'm going to die!
I'm going to die!
Okay, I get it.
I'll listen to you!
What do you want?
A shark.
Don't screw around!
I'm the one that wants to cry here!
Okay. A shark.
Piece of cake!
I'll go get one!
Let me off!
Dogs...
They're dogs, so they might bite.
Sakamoto, there are dogs.
They might bite us.
W-What? A-Are you afraid of dogs?
T-They're on leads, so there's no way we'll get bitten.
Our only choice is to run!
All right, run away!
Sakamoto, we can't escape!
Don't give up!
If you give up, it's over!
Ask the owner to hurry up and put their leads on!
It's...
It's no good!
Use your brain!
Isn't there anything?
I found a gummy in my pocket.
That's it!
While they're busy eating it, we'll make our escape!
I know!
Make a tool to help us escape.
Oh, right!
I forgot!
Sakamoto!
What is it?
I don't have any tools to make a tool!
Damn!
Fine then, just do whatever you want!
TL Note: This is a common Japanese phrase: Boil me or burn me or do whatever you want to me.
Boil... burn... whatever you want...
Dinner.
We're going to be eaten.
We're going to be eaten.
If we're going to be eaten, we might be eaten.
Huh, Professor?
Why are you crying?
Are you lost?
It's Yukko!
Oh, this is the Professor you were talking about.
Oh, Sakamoto is with you?
Let me pet him!
No, Yukko!
Go take care of the dogs!
He's a lot softer than I expected!
Me next!
Don't screw around!
Hurry up and fend the dogs off!
I get it!
You want revenge because they bit you!
No, they're about to bite us!
What's that?
Let me guess: you're scared of dogs? Who are you, Oba-Q?
TL Note: Oba-Q, from the manga Obake no Q-tarou, is deathly afraid of dogs.
That's not it!
It's a dog, so it's going to bite!
Look how friendly he is.
There's no way he'll bite.
It'll bite.
It won't bite.
It'll bite!
Bite some gum?
Just kidding.
It'll bite!
Well then, look.
Here, shake.
Hey, Yukko, are you okay?
It won't bite if you don't get near it, so don't worry.
Yukko was... Yukko was...
It's okay.
Yukko's just stupid.
I got it.
All right, let's get Yukko up and go to Nano-chan's house.
Oh, you know Nano?
Of course I kn -
Where were you?!
You have to keep them on a lead!
Did you play with them?
What are you talking about?!
They almost bit us!
Here.
Chocolate sharks!
Thank you very much.
There were dogs, and we got chocolate.
Isn't that great, Sakamoto?
Being afraid of dogs. You're still just a kid.
More importantly, take this rope off of me.
All right, since I got chocolate.
Huh?
What's wrong?
Sakamoto, take it off.
It's stuck.
It'd be off already if I could!
Let's get Yukko to take it off.
Hey, Yukko, take this off.
Hey, Yukko.
Hey, Yukko.
Hey!
H-Hey, isn't that...
I'm back.
There were so many dogs.
Wow, you're sweating a lot!
Oh, right!
There was chocolate!
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate...
That being said, Aioi-san and Naganohara-san sure are late.
I'm sure they came in this direction...
W-What is this?
Buddy.
Little Buddy.
What exactly are they doing?!
Grandpa!
People live by helping each other out, Takashi.
The same is true about animals' hearts, Takashi.
Don't take the bond between an animal and a human lightly, Takashi.
Grandpa...
I'm Kiyoshi.
I'm Melon Bread.
Humans, do you prefer it with the taste of melon or without?
Continue the debate over this for eternity.
Next time on Nichijou: Episode 23.
Look forward to it!
