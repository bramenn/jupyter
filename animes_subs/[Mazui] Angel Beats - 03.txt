Why is the new song a ballad?
Is that bad?
For a diversion, yes.
Um...
What do you mean by diversion?
Didn't I tell you during Operation Tornado?
She leads a school rock band which is very popular amongst the normal students.
We don't directly cause any harm to them,
but sometimes we use them, and if they're in the way we have to remove them from the scene.
At times like that, we use GirlDeMo to divert their attention.
They're pretty trendy for NPCs.
It just goes to show that their band has real skill and appeal.
So, no good?
A ballad is kind of...
We won't be able to carry out a flashy operation if it's that kind of a calming song, right?
I see, rejected then.
Well then, let's get back to the briefing.
Here's everyone's orders.
Otonashi - kun.
Close the curtains.
Our next operation will be the revenge of the Angel Area Invasion Plan.
We commence in three days.
You want to use that plan?
But last time
This time, this person will be accompanying us.
Pleased to meet you.
From behind the chair?
Four - eyes.
What kind of joke is this, Yurippe?
Will a coward like him really be useful?
Now now, don't say that.
Then...
I'll test him!
You don't have any friends, do you...
Stop!
Please stop!
No way, Pi?!
Four - eyes.
Stop, stop!
That guy's an idiot!
That's right. Our weakness is that we're stupid.
That's not something the leader should say...
In our last invasion plan, we displayed a clear lack of intelligence.
However!
This time, by using the man who made a name for himself as a genius hacker
handle name Takeyama - kun the planning team can do a detailed investigation of the area.
That's not his real name?
If you could, please...
Call me Christ.
Look, you went and ruined his cool handle name.
That's Yurippe for you.
So, what is this Angel Area?
It's where Angel lives.
Where she lives?
I wonder what kind of place she lives in...
Wait, why would we need a hacker for that sort of place?
The core is computer - controlled.
It's mechanical?
There must be a way to get through to God in there somewhere.
This plan is crazy!
Considering this is our second attempt, Angel will have tighter security than before.
We'll need GirlDeMo to put on an especially flashy show.
Understood.
Get chance and luck!
Beneath Connection Bridge 2
Good, I'm doing well.
Wait, aren't I getting a little too used to this?
But those guys aren't as bad as my first impressions of them.
Classroom block B Message Board
Is this the flashy diversion?
Ah sorry, did I startle you?
Oh, it's you.
You know me?
Yes!
My senpai who always walks around with a huge axe told me to be wary around you because you bring calamity or something.
That bastard...
But is it okay to advertise that it's in the sports hall like this?
No, it's quite dangerous. Unheard of.
It's not even a guerrilla live this time, it's an announced event.
The teachers won't ignore this, and there's no knowing what other obstacles we'll face.
But I heard that the plan this time requires that we go this far to gather an audience.
Girls Dead Monster, huh...
By the way, you must be...
I'm Yui!
I'm still an underling in the diversion unit.
But I'm happy with even just that!
I get to be a GirlDeMo roadie!
Do you know? Girls Dead Monster are amazing!
GirlDeMo for short!
They perform amazingly for an all - girl band,
and above all they have Iwasawa - san on vocals and guitar!
She even does the composition and lyrics!
My favorite is Crow Song!
The climax feels like it has such amazing resolution!
The lyrics are about Iwasawa - san, and...
And, and, you know what pumps me up?
Alchemy! Alchemy is...
I'm not finished yet! Alchemy is...
Do you have time to waste here like this?!
Work a bit more seriously for your beloved GirlDeMo!
Oh yeah!
Well then, excuse me.
Classroom block A Empty classroom
Whoop!
Sorry, I need to restring my guitar.
Okay, break time.
You guys were on fire.
I can understand why the students go crazy for you.
Before I realized it, I stopped to listen.
Thanks.
So, you don't have any memories?
Yeah.
Must be nice.
Are your memories also...
Someone else told you about their memories?
Yeah, Yuri.
Oh, Yuri...
Hers are the worst.
Mine aren't that bad.
Not as bad?
It's nothing much.
I couldn't sing the songs I wanted to, that's all.
My parents were always fighting.
I didn't have my own room,
so I just crouched in a corner with my hands over my ears.
My only escape was to hide in my own little world.
There was nowhere I could rest.
That's when I discovered a band called Sad Machine.
The vocalist was in the same kind of unhappy situation as me.
I heard that when things were painful for her, she'd cover her ears with headphones and escape to the world of music.
I tried it too.
It was like everything was blown away.
The vocals screamed for me.
They grieved for me.
The ones who put on the act of common sense were wrong.
Those who cried were right.
We, the lonely, were more human.
They screamed at the absurd, beat it down, and destroyed it.
They saved me.
I first met it one day abandoned in the rain.
That's when I began singing.
Even in such an empty life as mine, I had songs.
Are you serious?
With your grades, you could go anywhere
I don't want to rely on my parents anymore.
I did part time jobs for a living,
and kept auditioning at recording studios.
I told myself I'd leave that house when I graduated.
I'd go to the city, and then...
live by my music.
That's what I thought.
Huh?
Maybe I'm tired...
I can't play the guitar like this...
Maybe I should cancel the performance tonight and rest...
When I woke up, I was unable to speak.
Cerebral contusion.
It was aphasia due to a stroke.
The cause was an accident during a fight my parents were having.
I cursed my fate.
I had nowhere to escape.
And like that, my life ended.
Iwasawa!
Oh, Hisako? Okay.
We're tired of waiting already.
No - memory boy!
You can have that.
Just now...
Those were eyes that curse the unfairness of life.
She also had a harsh life.
No one's afraid of becoming a water flea.
The people here...
They're all trying to rebel against God,
against accepting an unfair life.
They're trying to fight it.
Just overlook it this one time, president!
Yeah, GirlDeMo's live concerts are the only fun we get to look forward to!
Don't take that from us!
Yeah, yeah!
Right?
Huh?
Where'd she go?
It's almost like I'm the bad guy.
Sports Hall
Got it? The operation this time will be carried out with the bare minimum number of members.
It will take place today, 1900 hours.
Operation start!
Too few...
You get a special seat.
It's time.
Alright...
Let's put on a show!
Clear!
Clear!
Alright, infiltration successful.
What?
Angel Area infiltration.
Close the door!
Takeyama - kun, we'll leave the computer to you.
Call me Christ.
Um... this is...
This is just a normal girl's room!
We're trespassing!
What the hell are you doing?
Girl's Dormitory
This is the girl's dorm!
Turn off the light!
And computer - controlled?
There's just a computer in the room!
A password...
Nobody could figure it out before.
I see.
Then this is where I demonstrate my skills.
Beginning analysis.
Oh? Looks like you're not so useless.
Hey come on, respect people's privac
Hey, stop!
You're too noisy.
Keep it quiet, or I'll be taking your throat out.
What the hell!
I was just starting to think you weren't so bad, too!
Why...
We need more people to come...
Alchemy? This soon in?
That's good!
< Alchemy lyrics >
I want to live forever
And if I could live forever
Everything would be granted
All sorts of things
Keep having their way with me
All the time I have to live
Warping where my dreams will go
Even though they're so important to me
If it's all I can, right now
I'll go eat something sweet
Stop thinking like that
It's meaningless to talk
I look back at the path I walked and
mugen ni ikitai
mugen ni ikiraretara
subete kanau
iroirona mono ga
atashi wo oikondeku
ikiru nokori jikan wo
yume no zahyou wo kurue

What the hell is going on?
What are you doing?
Go back to your dorms!
No way! We have to watch this!
That's right! Why don't you just go away!
Yeah!
She's here!
Give me more energy, everyone!
No, no one can do that for us...
We'll do it with our own strength!
Angel has appeared.
Understood.
Takeyama - kun.
I'm currently running a high speed password - cracking program.
It will be done soon.
Also, please call me Christ.
We're in.
Good job, Takeyama - kun!
Copy all the data!
That would take too much time.
An hour, at least.
And please, call me Chri
Why don't we just take the whole hard disk?
She'll notice that!
So what do we do?
Just show us any suspicious data, Takeyama - kun!
It's Christ!
A list of students?
NPCs...
No, we're included too.
It's just a name register!
There's not going to be anything suspicious there!
This really is just trespassing!
Shut up!
The diversionary squad has been suppressed.
Angel is returning.
We're out of time...
We didn't manage to get anything this time either...
We're retreating.
Dammit, stop screwing with us!
Stop it!
This is for us!
Let them go!
Their music supports us!
Please!
We were just being lenient till now.
Don't get cocky!
We're confiscating all these instruments.
It's not the cultural festival or anything.
We won't let you get away with this again.
I can throw this away, right?
Don't touch that...
Don't...
Don't touch that!!
Stop that!
Stop!
Hand it over.

The ones who ignore common sense laugh
What will they lie about next?
What will be gained
Can we hang it proud?
Man must go on regardless
That is my song
It's because you're crying
It's because you're lonely
You're right
That's being human
Those tears I cried
In time...
It's so beautiful
It's not a lie
For the real us
Thank you

The new song...
Takeyama - kun!
Got it. And call me Christ!
This is my life...
To go on singing like this...
This is why I was born.
Just as I was saved...
I'll save someone else like this.
Finally...
I finally found it.
Iwasawa...
Can you summarize what we learned, Yurippe?
Angel is developing her own powers herself.
And strangely enough, it looks like she's doing it the same way we make weapons.
What does that mean?
I'm not certain yet,
so I won't say anything now.
Come on, don't be so secretive, Yurippe.
The fact that she needs to use the same methods as us...
The only conclusion we can draw from that is...
the worst case scenario.
There are no gods anywhere.
Why doesn't Angel get her powers from God?
Why does she have to develop them herself?
I'll bring up the next issue then.
Where did Iwasawa - san disappear to?
Didn't Angel erase her?
But it was in the middle of a concert!
What are you saying happened, then?
Who could have done that to Iwasawa-san...
No one.
She accepted it herself.
That's all there is to it.
To disappear, you have to obey what Angel says and lead a normal student life.
But that isn't the only way.
< preview >
Play ball!
I'll be useful!
It's baseball.
Don't stop the dancing!
It's a challenge, kid.
This is Iwasawa's replacement?
I don't know what the hell I did before I died!
Let's make the best team ever!
Yui, nyan <3
Just who are we fighting?
You're fired.
It's a punishment game more terrifying than death.
Your team is not registered.
That might feel better than anything yet...

I open my eyes again, to a sleepy morning
I tighten the tie around my neck
When I pass through the door of the classroom
I puff my chest out with a little bit of pride
A wind that blows past everyday life
I thought I heard it
I thought I felt it
It started to shake within my chest
I felt it would come now
I watched countless stars as they vanished
I waved goodbye, I'm glad

I've always walked alone
When I turn around, everyone's far behind
Even so, I kept walking
That was what strength was
I'm not afraid of anything anymore,
I try to whisper to myself
Everyone becomes alone someday
They live on only in memories
So I can laugh with my heart, even in this loneliness
I will fight
I will show no tears
