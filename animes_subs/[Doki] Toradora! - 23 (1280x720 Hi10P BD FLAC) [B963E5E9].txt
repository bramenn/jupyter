My sil ky love
My sil ky love
My sil ky love
My sil ky love
Every hour of the day
whenever I think of you
these impatient feelings
simply overflow.
Even though it's easy to say I love you
when you stand in front of me
my personality stands up and gets in my way.
I can usually pull through with my assertiveness
that's just how I am.
But no matter how hard I try, I can't break the wall that's between us.
I want you to realise my feelings.
So I always send a gaze
of I really love you your way
with all of my courage!
My flimsy silky heart.
After meeting you, I finally realised
that I'm really clumsy when it comes to love.
The scars from love that I'd almost forgotten
have started to ache all of a sudden.
Someday, like how I normally would...
I must say I love you, or else I'll become even weaker.
On the nights I cant sleep
I sigh alone.
H ow is everyone?
I feel a little lonely.
Within the vast world, a single seed
extended its roots
and put out a fruit that was still unripe.
The fruit that I wish would turn orange soon
is bathed in your light.
The ideals and dreams just swell -
H ey, feel it.
Today, I tried eating an orange
but it was so sour I cried.
I couldnt leave it behind like I have been
so I ate it all.
I love it I feel like crying.
I love it I love it.
The Road We Must Advance On

I wish to find a job.

Confession
No, no, no, no!
You don't need to, really!
People are eating, so don't do it!
It's better to see it with your own eyes than to hear about it!
Now, see for yourself!
It's great, right?
Aisaka is finally back.
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, why are you girls screaming?
Speaking of which, Valentine's is nearly here.
I doubt these festive youngsters will listen to anything I say.
Oh, Valentine's...
I nearly forgot about it.
Stop pretending! Those lies won't work on me!
Sensei?
You plan to make out while I'm not paying attention, right?
Doing such indecent things at school...
You know, it's really pointless to give or receive chocolate at school.
School is a place to learn.
W-We're being lectured by Haruta...
Huh? Am I wrong?
Then, what's school for?
Health care and PE, right?
Oh, yeah.
Takasu-kun, Aisaka-san, please come to the interview room after school.
Takasu-kun, you still can't turn in your career assessment?
And Aisaka-san, you haven't even turned the one from first semester in...
I'm sorry, I'm still discussing it with my family.
Your mother wants you to go to college, right?
Yasuko has -
My mother has always been a hard worker, but sometimes she pushes herself too much.
I don't want to be a burden anymore,
so I'm not planning on going to college.
That is what I wish for.
So Aisaka-san, what's your reason for not turning it in?
I come from a rich family, so I won't ever need to work.
That's also why I don't need to study.
Plus, there's nothing I want to do.
Seriously, you two...
Even if I don't go to college -
I understand. It's just that you'll be on your own for the rest of your life.
You can't just blame stuff on others.
No one will take responsibility for you.
That's why I want you two to carefully think it through.
Takasu-kun, you haven't gone against your mother's intentions, have you?
After you've finished filling it out, bring it to the staff room.
The rest of my life, huh?
What are you -
Hey, that's the career assessment form -
Hey!
I don't need something like that.
It's impossible for me to think about my future.
I can't even recognise myself right now.
I've always, always denied my present self.
Why is this happening?
What should I do to avoid it?
How can I know what I want to do later when I don't even know what I want to do right now?
There's one thing I want to do!
I want to fall in love normally!
Hey, what's wrong?
Y-You don't even have someone -
No...
Someone I like?
I don't even know who it is.
I wanted to be born into a normal family, then raised as a normal good girl,
and then have a normal encounter with a guy, and become friends normally.
I wanted to fall in love normally like that...
Why are you using past tense?
I told you, it's impossible.
I mean, the conditions are already wrong.
I'm not normal at all.
What do you mean by normal?
What's right, and what's wrong?
Who's there to decide those things?
Hold it, why are you suddenly lecturing me?
Oh, no...
I didn't mean that...
Where are you going?
What about the career assessments?
I'm going home, I don't give a damn about that.
Taiga...
Excuse me.
I told you already...
Didn't I already refuse?
I've always been -
But Kawashima, think about it one more -
I don't have time to think about it anymore.
Bye, I'm going home.
Wait, Kawashima-kun!
What are you doing standing there?
Hurry up and chase her!
Hurry!
What do you want to do to my shoe?
Huh?
Give it back.
You have a shoe fetish?
Gross.
Hey -
I can't believe this.
Why are you trying to set a record for long throws at a time like this?
I said I'm sorry.
Hey...
Why were you called to the staff room?
I said I wouldn't model the school uniform for a school information pamphlet.
Why did you refuse?
Isn't that your speciality?
I just don't want to do it.
I don't even know how much longer I'll be at this school.
Don't tell me that your fight with Kushieda -
No, a trivial person like Kushieda Minori couldn't have an influence on my life.
Then, why did you say that?
To be honest, I planned to leave after the first semester.
News about the stalker thing has died down too.
I've never heard you mention -
I decided I wanted to stay here a bit longer.
I wanted to be with you guys tomorrow,
or even the day after tomorrow...
Then, why?
I watched Taiga get hurt, and understood her pain.
I thought that, since I understood her,
I'd save her if no one else did, or something like that...
Now I realise that everything would sort itself out if I left.
Kawashima, you -
Wait!
Why now, of all -
Taiga? I'm really bu -
What about the shop?
My part-time job at the cake store too...
They even made a cute uniform for me...
I contacted both places.
Just rest, and don't worry about anything.
Okay...
S-Situation...
Ya-chan is sleeping, shh...
Ryuuji, how's Ya-chan?
Oh, don't worry about her.
Thank god, seeing her faint from my window scared the heck out of -
Ryuuji?
Hey, where are you going?
I'm going to buy something for Yasuko to eat.
Wait, Ryuuji! What about your coat?
Ryuuji?
You left your cell phone, wallet, and key! Your eco-bag too!
Get a grip on yourself, idiot!
Geez, put it on already!
You too. Why are you like that?
Wear this.
No, I'm all right! You wear it!
Ryuuji?
Hey, you...
Go home.
No.
Go home, seriously.
No! You're acting all weird now!
Just go home!
Ryuuj -
What were you doing?
It's all my fault.
Yasuko fainted because of me.
It's my fault...
It's all my fault...
What are you talking about?
She has anaemia! It's her body!
It's not your fault!
If I wasn't so useless,
Yasuko would have more faith and trust in me...
She would rely on me more, and then things like this would never happen...
Ryuuji!
Ryuuji...
What should I do?
It's all right!
It's... all right?
Yeah, it's all right!
It's all right, I'm a super mum!
Ryuuji...
What's wrong?
Don't go...
I'm fine now.
I have somewhere to go.
That's troublesome...
Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow are the busiest times because of Valentine's Day.
I'm sorry, she really can't come.
I don't think I'll be able to find a substitute at this time...
I'm sorry!
I'll do it.
You can?
I'm saved!
Taiga?
It's not for you.
I want to do something for Ya-chan.
I'll help too!
I was fired from my part-time job at the cake shop?
But -
It's only natural.
I'm sure I'll be able to find another job.
W-Why are you comforting me?
W-Wel...
No one's coming...
Say it with a stronger voice!
I mean, your face wasn't born for advertising food.
You...
Oh, you guys are really working!
Yo, Taka-chan!
What are you doing -
Haruta-kun, which one do you like?
They say if you buy big ones, bad things will happen.
I don't think so.
Then, I'll take that big one.
May I have this one, please?
T-That'll be 580 yen...
You have an elder sister?
She's not my sister, she's my girlfriend.
Bye! Have fun with your jobs!
Don't you feel cold?
Let's go to a warm place.
Sure.
Why?
The world really has changed.
Noto! Why are you here?
Well, I just happened to pass by...
Oh yeah, has anyone else come by?
For example, Ami-chan, or even Nanako-sama...
Kihara didn't come.
Huh? No!
I don't really care!
Well, you see,
I was just wondering if Kihara will give Kitamura chocolate, or something...
Then what will happen?
I'm fine with it either way.
I mean, look Taiga, you care about that, right?
What?
What do you mean by that?
Besides, why does Kihara Maya buying chocolate for Kitamura-kun concern you?
Oh, I see.
You like Kihara Maya.
So people who realise their feelings after fighting really do exist...
I'm just interested!
W-What are you talking about?!
That's so strange, Taiga!
I don't think it's strange at all.
It's perfectly normal.
A male's stamen and a female's pistil...
Idiot!
There's something wrong with your brain!
What's going on with him?
Crap...
We'll be scolded if we mess around anymore.
I guess there's no other choice than to summon the lethal weapon.
I thought you were by yourself.
Y-Yo.
I'm going home.
Well, since you came...
Here, Stupid Chi', hold this.
Huh?
No thanks. Don't make me do weird things.
I'm beautiful, so I naturally grab people's attention.
Yes, yes, you're beautiful! You're really attractive!
That's why you should take this and say, I love the chocolate here! out loud.
What's this?
You want me to advertise?
Yeah.
No thanks.
Why would I do such a lame thing?
It's all right, Stupid Chi'.
Oh yeah, how about you buy one for yourself?
You could give it to Minorin to make up with her.
Huh?
Contrary to popular belief, I care about you.
You want to get on good terms with Minorin, but it's not working out for you.
The shaking delicate heart of a Chihuahua -
Hey, why are you making assump -
If you're embarrassed, I'll call Minorin for you.
My, Valentine's Day came just in time.
You!
Hey, isn't that Kawashima Ami-chan?
You're right! She's so cute!
Her face is so slender!
It's really Ami-chan!
Is she buying chocolate at that place?
Ami-chan loves the chocolate here.
Even my model friends say it's good.
I want to buy the same kind as Ami-chan's!
Wow, she can be helpful from time to time.
Excuse me.
Yes, I'll be right there!
Ryuuji, where are you -
Excuse me, I would like this one.
C-Coming!
Hey, Kawashima!
You really like chasing after people, don't you?
You have potential to be a stalker.
You too.
You like running away, right?
Not just from me, but from a lot of other things too.
Listen, I don't think it'd be better if you left.
Besides, you'll disappoint everyone if you leave.
Everyone adores you.
Everyone?
Yeah, everyone.
You really don't get it.
Look, Taiga can't handle it by herself.
Oh, crap!
Actually, I'd be happy even if it wasn't everyone.
I don't get it myself either.
Thanks! I'll be counting on you tomorrow!
We've reached our target already, so it's pointless to buy the rest.
It's all right, I'm going to give them out.
Give them out?
Yeah, I caused a lot of trouble for people on the trip.
Like Kitamura-kun, Minorin, and the Stupid Chi'.
And also...
If I gave you chocolate, would you be happy?
Because I don't know.
W-What don't you know?
I wouldn't be human if getting chocolate from you didn't make me happy.
Oh, okay.
Then, I'll try my best.
Just giving you guys store-bought chocolate is rude,
so I'll try to do something nice with it.
Hopefully I can make everyone happy.
Oh, it smells great!
You're going to the shop already?
I'm all healthy now, so it'll be fine.
I need to thank Taiga-chan...
Hey...
Why did you bring us all here?
Today is Valentine's Day,
so I made some chocolate to say thanks.
You made it by yourself?
Amazing!
It'll be such a waste to eat it!
Wasn't that the chocolate you were selling yesterday?
You're really good at telling lies -
No!
The wrapping was nice so I reused it, but I made everything inside.
Here, this is for you.
Thank you for yesterday.
I won't help you with stuff like that anymore.
Yesterday was an exception.
Next is Minorin's.
I know you went to save me during the field trip.
Thank you.
You don't need to be so formal...
I'll come to save you whenever you're in trouble!
Minorin!
Ryuuji.
You too, thanks.
Share it with Ya-chan, okay?
Okay...
Next is Kitamura-kun's.
I put the most effort into this one.
Oh, is that all right?
It's all right, you were the person who carried me from the bottom of the cliff, after all.
Crap, I didn't tell Kushieda to -
Oh, gosh!
I wonder if my eyes were all white...
I really didn't expect that to happen!
I rolled down like this, and there were some weird noises in my head.
I finally found out what fainting feels like.
It's like dreaming.
I felt like I blurted out things that I wasn't supposed to say.
When I regained my consciousness, I started to panic...
What do you think you blurted out?
I really, really can't say it!
Minorin, I can't tell you!
Tell me.
I can't! Anyway, it was just my delusion!
Just tell me.
It's something that no one should know!
I'll be ruined if people find out.
I won't be able to live anymore because it's something really, really messed up.
Just kidding.
You didn't hear it, right?
Yeah, I heard nothing, right Takasu?
No one heard anything, it's all right.
Liar.
You think everything will be all right if you pretend you didn't hear it?!
W-What are you doing, Minorin?
Taiga, you're glad that no one heard it because that solves everything, right?!
Takasu-kun was the one who saved you, but he just didn't tell you!
He didn't tell you because of what you said, right?!
Why, Taiga?
Why can't you just be honest for once?!
It hurts!
Kitamura-kun?
My, you look scary.
Stupid Chi'...
Hey, Takasu.
Do you think it'll be all right if you let Aisaka run away?
Are you okay with it?
Look here, Taiga!
Look at me!
No!
What do you see me as?
I'm Minorin, your best friend, right?!
No, no, no, no!
Didn't you say you like me?
Then, believe in me!
Let go of me!
Taiga, I believe in you.
I don't think you're the kind of person to blame others for your inability to go after what you want!
Or are you someone like that?!
That's not it...
I just want you to be happy...
I just want the Minorin I love to be happy...
Cut it out!
My happiness can only be...
My happiness doesn't depend on anyone but me!
This is all we can do.
That's right.
Taiga!
Amin, are you betraying us?
Bad things will happen if you don't chase after her.
Takasu-kun, I'll chase after Taiga.
I'm not done talking with her yet.
What are you doing to do?
What am I going to do?
What will happen if I chase after her?
What will I do after I find out how Taiga feels?
She obviously wanted to hide it...
Takasu-kun!
Hey Taiga, it's about to snow.
The laundry is still outside...
Not just that,
I think I left a lot of things out.
