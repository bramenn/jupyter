It appeared as though humanity would be destroyed by the demons.
But a single mage saved them all.
He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
Show me who you really are!
Never giving up...
is my magic!
The Queen of Witches released Asta's limiter suppressing his anti-magic
and awakened his full powers.
What is this?
It feels like I'm in a cold lake.
It feels cool...
My mind is unbelievably clear.
And I can feel...
the power overflowing!
I assumed that you might be one of their kin,
but apparently I was wrong.
A sudden mutation kept mana from dwelling in you.
You're merely defective.
But because of that, you are able to wield that sword.
You aren't special. Not in the slightest.
But that's exactly what makes you special.
Black Meteorite!
Asta was able to defeat Ladros, thanks to this newly awakened power,
and Ladros turned over a new leaf.
However...
Controlling blood. That is my magic.
From now on, you'll spend your life in my employ, working as my blade.
The Queen of Witches was after Asta's anti-magic all along.
She then took control of Asta...
Now, for your first task...
I shall force you to kill everyone here with your own two hands.
The Red Thread of Fate
No... way...
Asta, stop!
Asta!
Now, then... Which one of you shall I kill first?
I know.
I'll start with you, little royal.
Go.
Stop!
No! Wake up!
Snap out of it, Asta!
It's no use. He can't hear us.
Asta, stop! Don't you recognize me?
It must be fate...
To think that a royal of the Clover Kingdom shall die by his sword.
Asta...
Asta...
Wake up!
Asta...
This is farewell.
No!
Asta, don't!
Do it.
This boy... He's unconscious, and yet...
Asta...
So he's not completely under her control.
I won't let you kill me.
I'm not going to let you kill me!
Just you wait!
I'll shake this flimsy spell off right this instant!
These stupid things!
Puppet's Blood binds itself with the blood in your body and takes hold.
No matter how much you struggle, you will never undo it.
That goes for you as well, even if you don't have any magic.
Asta...
You sre stubborn. However...
Asta!
Please! Make him stop!
I swear that I'll never leave this forest again!
I'll never disobey you again... So please...
No.
I will kill them here, perfectly,
to keep you from having any more foolish notions ever again.
My divinations told me, Vanessa will summon what you want
and return to the forest alive someday.
That is why I didn't search very hard for you.
Granted, I didn't think that what I wanted would be a human with anti-magic swords.
But what did you gain by going outside?
You formed trivial bonds with imperfect fools, and as a result,
you only brought about their deaths.
You cannot escape me.
You cannot sever this bond.
Bond?
After all, you are my daughter. My family.
I'm... part of your family?
You belong to me.
No way!
No, really!
Oh, yeah! That town had really delicious cake.
I want to go, too.
Hey, please! Help me!
I want to leave!
Hey, please! Please, don't go!
Vanessa.
Your Majesty...
Please let me out of here! I don't want to be in here anymore!
I'm so lonely all by myself! How long do I have to stay in here?
Your Majesty!
This thread magic doesn't have the sort of incredible power you say it does!
Please, let me out of here!
No. You will one day have the power to control destiny.
It clearly says so in my divinations.
But
You asked how long you must stay in there, and I shall give you an answer.
I won't let you out of there
until you invoke the magic that allows you to control destiny.
You are my family.
If I'm your family, let me out of here!
I cannot do that.
I will be the one to choose your destiny.
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
Please, wait! Please let me out of here!
I don't have... powers like that.
Oh, yeah. That cake shop ended up closing down.
That's a shame.
Hey, did you know?
There's a big town outside this forest,
and there are a lot of people who aren't witches living there.
Vanessa... We've heard that story hundreds of times.
All the other witches go there to have fun, right?
Some even have boyfriends.
Why don't you escape from this cage and go out there, too?
What? B-But I can't...
I mean...
I can't defy the Queen of Witches.
C-Come on, cheer up.
Do you want me to ask the Queen of Witches for you?
That's impossible. You're a doll that I created with my own magic.
If I can't do it, neither can you.
You have a point.
This whole conversation is just you talking to yourself to begin with.
Hopefully you'll be able to make some real friends someday.
That's impossible... There's no way.
I'm going to be stuck like this forever... I'll never be free.
It seems a bit noisy outside...
There's a man!
Intruder!
Intruder?
Jeez... Come on now. I'm just doing some warrior training.
A man?
Why am I being chased around this forest just for being a guy?
I've never seen one before. A man...
And that hysterical old hag is a tough cookie, damn it.
He fought the Queen?
What the hell is this place, anyway?
Huh? Who're you? What are you doing in a place like this?
U-Um, w-well, you see...
The Queen has me locked up in here.
You're locked up in here?
So you're literally like a bird in a cage.
I've never been outside.
Seriously? Well, that sucks.
But, hey. You're in luck.
There's a huge hole in it now, so you can get out that way.
I-I can't! I'll never be able to escape the Queen.
I'm fated to stay here.
Huh? I'm fated to stay here?
Oh, right. Good ol' Mr. Fate.
I hate that bastard.
Like hell I'm gonna listen to'im.
I'll do what I want, even if I have to crush fate myself.
I'm pretty sure I can't beat that hysterical old hag right now, though.
So I'm getting the hell outta here.
See ya, little birdie.
W-Wait! What should I do?
Hell if I know. Choose for yourself.
I'm a bird trapped in a cage...
Which means that I should have wings.
I can fly through that big, blue sky.
I will choose...
for myself!
What I obtained in the outside world was...
No, it's not you.
What?
You're not my family!
The Black Bulls are!
And right now, that family is about to be taken from me, right before my eyes!
If I can't stop this, why do I even exist?!
Please! If I truly have this power...
My magic, I implore you...
Change destiny!
What is this?
The red thread... of fate.
Is that what this is?
I didn't visualize it taking this shape.
Why?
Did she finally discover the power to control fate?
Well, then... Let us find out.
No!
It only touched him?
Nothing is happening?
Rue your sin in having underestimated the Queen of Witches.
No!
So it was still incomplete.
But have no fear.
I am perfection, and I shall ensure that it is fostered properly under my supervision.
No!
What?
What in the world? I could've sworn that he cut down the royal girl.
Rue your sin in having underestimated the Queen of Witches.
Didn't I just speak those words a few moments ago?
What?
Was there some kind of mistake?
Stop!
It's over.
Stop!
This... It cannot be...
Then how about him?
Then how about the cat itself?
Puppet's Blood has come undone?
Are you telling me my manipulation failed?
This... This truly is the power to control destiny.
In all likelihood, this magic changes
the destinies of the people the cat touches to the caster's advantage.
Vanessa herself probably didn't see the fates where her companions were killed.
She's only seeing the attacks continue to miss against all odds.
This cat is both harmless and unavoidable.
So you've awakened. Well done, Vanessa.
I've been waiting for this moment.
I've waited so, so long.
Blood Magic: Puppet's Blood!
Vanessa!
Now both you and your magic belong to me.
That power best suits me because I am perfect.
Now, fate, align yourself with me!
What was...
What just happened?
Darling!
Domina! Mariella!
You're safe...
Impossible...
Impossible. Impossible!
There's nothing that my perfect magic cannot control!
So why?
So this is the power to control destiny that you were talking about.
I don't know much about this power yet,
but there is one thing I do know.
This magic only takes the side of myself and those I have a family bond with.
You and I have no bond.
Petit Clover!
Vanessa Saw...!
Vanessa Saw...!
Oh, my lovely princess, please marry me.
Oh, my prince! I'm so happy!
Do you really choose me?
Yes, it has to be you. You're almost as beautiful as the Queen of Witches!
Oh, I could never compare to her!
The Queen of Witches is so beautiful, kind, and beloved by all!
No, you truly are.
You're so elegant, kind, and proud, just like the great Queen of Witches.
Oh, I'm so happy, my prince!
Oh, my princess.
Man, it's so quiet around here without those knuckleheads around.
That means I can take a dump in peace.
But it's a little too quiet. They'd better get back soon.
