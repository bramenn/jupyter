Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
I've surpassed the old man...
Yo Ho! Steer that rudder! Hard to port!
Yo Ho! Our high-flyin' lives are every which way!
When the sun goes down, there's a bon voyage bash.
It ain't sad at all.
As long as we're alive, we'll meet again somewhere!
Blast straight through a headwind, set off!
Stay strong until the tears dry up! A man gotta be tough.
Friends, friends, laugh one day!
As proof of our strong, strong bonds!
Now, grab that map to the shining future!
B-But... Why?
Why wasn't any of you killed?
Fantasia!
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
How about Natsu?
Seems okay to me.
After using all that magical power...
All the members of the guild and the people of the city are safe as well.
Freed...
Not a single person has been killed.
That shouldn't be!
My Fairy Law was perfect!
It was your heart, Laxus.
You inherited more than just the master's strength and magical power.
You also got a heart that feels for your friends!
Fairy Law only affects those the caster sees as his enemy.
You understand what this means, right Laxus?
The feelings he has deep down are revealed through his magic.
Magic never lies, Laxus.
This is what you really feel.
No!
Everyone who gets in my way is my enemy!
My enemy!
Just quit this already, Laxus.
Go to the master.
Who gives a crap about that old man?
I am me! Not just some old man's grandson!
I'm Laxus!
Laxus...
Everybody knows that.
Don't get so puffed up, you jerk!
Does being Gramps' grandson make you so different from the rest of us?!
Quit screaming about blood relatives!
Everybody in the guild is in the same family!
And what the hell do you know?
So I don't know! Aren't we guildmates anyway?!
None of us know! That's why we help each other out!
Laxus!
Shut up, Natsu!
Disappear off the face of the earth!
I'll be the one to stop you!
Even if the guild dies, it'll never be yours.
Because it's our home to return to!
Can't you even die right?!
Do you honestly think you could beat me?
Natsu!
The guild isn't yours.
Just think about it, Laxus.
Shut up!
Breakdown Fist of the Thunder Dragon!
It's 100 years too early for you to be preaching to me, pipsqueak.
He can still stand?
That's enough, Natsu...
You damned brat!
I'll make sure there's not even a trace left!
Stop it, Laxus!
If you use that magic while Natsu is like this...
Halberd of the Thunder Dragon!
Don't!
Gajeel!
Iron... Did he use himself as a lightning rod?
Go!
How dare you!
Iron Fist...
Damn you!
Talons!
Wing Slash!
Sword Edge!
Flaming Elbow!
That magic will shatter a dragon's scales, crush its innards,
and cut down its very soul.
True dragon-killing attacks...
Blazing Flashover Blade!
Laxus...
Why have you come, Grandeenay?
It's been a while.
I thought coming here or meddling were forbidden!
That child really goes overboard, you know.
I wonder who he takes after?
But his luck won't last him forever.
He might die.
Get out!
Do not interfere with the humans!
Do you wish to anger me? Anger Igneel?!
Yes. No matter how we may be worried, there is not a thing we can do.
All we can do is believe in the power of the humans.
Zeref is... Never mind, let it be.
So Fantasia's been postponed until tomorrow night?
Does their master not feel well?
He might be retiring.
I wonder who the next master will be?
It'll probably be Laxus...
That problem-child?
It sorta makes you think, huh?
I known him since he was a kid.
But we all get older, don't we?
Thanks to Poluchka, it seems his life has been saved for now.
Worry not. The master is safe.
Thank goodness! I didn't know what was going to happen for a little while there.
That old man isn't gonna kick the bucket so easily!
But the master is quite old. Stressing his heart more will only make his health worse.
Don't forget that, everyone.
Aye, sir!
But are we really doing the Fantasia under these conditions?
It's what the master wants. It's precisely at times like this that we should do it.
Juvia is also looking forward to seeing the Fantasia!
You'll be participating.
There you have it!
But... Juvia just joined...
Is she troubled or happy about it?
Which one is it?
She's so cute...
Well, we do have a lot of injured people.
The rule is: anyone who can still move has to participate?
Then I guess I'll participate too!
Are you happy about it or not?
Looks like those guys can't participate, though.
No kidding.
I don't wanna hear that from you.
I have no idea what you're saying.
I doubt it's anything important.
Not a chance. No way you can participate, trash.
What does that have to do with it?
Are you some demon?
I wonder how he can understand him?
I seriously doubt it's anything important.
Sometimes your cold-hearted feelings scare me!
But with this, we've fixed one of the problems in the guild.
Laxus!
Why, you...
Where's the old man?
How dare you...
No matter how much you hang your head, you think we'll let you see the master?
Yeah, that's right!
Stop it!
Will you cease this?
Erza...
He's in the inside clinic.
H-Hey...
Natsu.
Natsu...
Some interpretation, if you please?
This time was two against one, so I ain't satisfied.
I ain't gonna lose next time. I'll fight you anytime, Laxus!
He said.
But I thought he won?
I wouldn't call that winning either.
He's a monster.
Ever since I was in the war with Phantom, it gives me chills.
Okay, it's time for everyone to get ready for the Fantasia!
Now that I know I'm in it, we'd better practice!
Juvia will do her best!
What a noisy bunch.
Do you understand what you have done?
Look me in the eyes.
Guilds, you see...
They're a place where friends gather...
They're a place where you can get work...
And to kids with no place to go, they can be a home.
They're not something you can own.
A guild is the confidence and good will of each individual,
and from them the tough bonds that are formed.
You went against that good will and threatened the lives of your fellow members.
This is not something that can be forgiven.
I know.
You're so awkward.
Try relaxing a little, would you?
If you do that, maybe you'd see things you can't right now.
You'd hear words that you can't hear now.
Life is more fun!
Raising you was like a new lease on life for me.
You don't need power. You don't have to be smart.
Just be happy and healthy. That's all I ever wanted for you...
Laxus...
You are expelled!
Yeah... Sorry for the trouble...
Old man...
Take care of yourself.
Get out!
You've got to be kidding me!
Why are you the only one that's expelled?
Aren't we just as guilty?
Aren't we?
It's what the old man decided.
Then we'll quit!
Without you, we're...
What a pain you guys are.
What? Can't you just say goodbye?
Why are you trying to take all the responsibility on yourself?
That's not the case.
Unlike you, I don't have any attachments left to the guild.
We'll ask the master!
I'm sure Natsu and Gray will be against your expulsion!
No matter what they say, they...
Laxus...
Stay well!
Laxus!
What the hell?! What'll happen to the Raijin Tribe?
Damn it...
We'll see each other again.
Laxus...
Excellent, Ultear.
So, what happened to Jellal?
Who knows? Who cares?
What a pitiful man... He thought he was using you, but in fact he was being used himself.
It was fun for me.
He was really cute.
For 8 years, he never noticed I was pretending to be the spirit of Zeref...
Your brainwashing made the plan work perfectly.
The upheaval in the Council and the firing of Etherion...
Everything went exactly to plan.
Yes. While Jellal was on his rampage, you could move as you pleased.
Thanks to that, we've obtained one of the keys needed to unlock the seal.
Congratulations, Master Hades.
Sorry about this... Jellal-sama...
Aye!
Master!
You're not gonna join in?
Ain't my style.
Oh yeah, Mr. Shooby doo Bop?
Master, here.
Master Ivan, your son. I found out where he is.
Sorry about giving you such a dangerous job.
Eh, don't worry about it.
No screw ups here.
He has no idea I'm a double agent.
You did good.
I can't let him do as he pleases.
Master, are you ready?
Well, I'm off!
It's the master!
The master is coming!
That's too fancy for him...
It's more funky than fancy...
Please stop those freaky movements!
Gramps, aren't you going to participate in the Fantasia this time?
This is your big moment.
I'll be watching from the stands.
I wonder if I'll be able to see where you are...
Don't worry about me.
Then, in the middle of the parade...
I'll go like this!
What's that?
A message.
It means that even if I can't see where you are, I'm always looking at you, Gramps!
Laxus...
Did you see it, Gramps?
Gramps...
Even if I can't see you... Even if we are separated far apart...
I'll always be watching you.
I'll watch over you forever.
Yeah...
Thank you.
There's way more to go!
I'm fired up!
Aye, sir!
We're Fairy Tail wizards!
I'm still just a rookie...
But I've got to work hard and become a wizard that won't lose to anyone!
Fairy Tail is the best!
Lucy, they say smiling weird like that'll give you wrinkles.
Where, where?!
Just theoretically. So touchy, you are.
I don't wanna hear that from you!
And wait, we finally had a nice moment there...
And this is how they end it?
That time we laughed, saying we're both like each other,
we even kindly overlooked the little lies.
If we lose a place to go back to together, I don't care.
Because I'll protect that smile.
The meetings and partings numerous as the stars in the sky...
All the things I don't want to lose...
Right now I feel like I don't need any of them.
I just want to see you by my side,
all my happiness and sadness.
Let's start from here.
Let's start our tomorrow.
Let's do it like we've just been reborn.
Like flowers blown in a summer wind,
let us bloom brightly in this instant.
Natsu, I heard that a reporter from the Weekly Sorcerer is going to come interview Fairy Tail!
What's this?! You mean that magazine that's always printin' bad stuff about me?
I'll smack'em good!
Actually, I think it was all the truth...
But anyway, don't hurt them, no matter what, got it?
Sure thing! Leave it to me!
Next time: The Day of Fated Meeting
Did you know? They call that a flag.
Huh? What's that?
I wouldn't get your hopes up, Natsu.
