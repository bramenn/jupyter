Endless Eight Yeah, yeah. Sorry I made you wait.
Yeah, yeah. Sorry I made you wait.
- Okay, we're all here, so let's go. - Where are we going?
To the public swimming pool, of course!
Well, I guess that makes sense considering what I brought.
We have to do summer vacation-y things during our summer vacation!
We can never get back the time that we've lost!
And so we're going to do them now, in our one and only summer as tenth graders.
By the way, we're going to the pool by bike.
Did you ride your bikes, too?
No, the only two bikes we have are yours and mine.
Kyon, you'd better not lose to Koizumi.
This train is leaving the station!
Hurry up and park your bikes, you two.
Kyon, we're about to go have fun. This is no time to be exhausted.
Whose fault do you think this is?
Oh, the scent of chlorine. This really makes it feel like a pool!
That's a lot of people.
Come on, let's find a place to put our stuff and get swimming!
We're going to race!
- Come on, Mikuru! - Okay!
No diving It's dangerous!
Hurry up and get in! The water's warm so it feels fine!
Can't she read the no diving signs posted everywhere?
That looks like fun.
This makes me smile, though. It feels peaceful.
She has some rather normal ways of enjoying her time, don't you think?
Calling out of the blue to invite someone out to do something and only giving
a general idea of what's going to happen isn't what I'd call normal.
In my opinion, that's really nothing.
Miss Suzumiya, laughing and having a good time like that,
isn't likely to shake up the world, after all.
I hope that's the case...
All right!
What's wrong?
It's nothing. It's probably just my imagination.
Because so much has happened since the beginning of spring,
I've become a little paranoid.
Here you are.
Thank you.
It's delicious.
All right, let's go swim some more!
Jeez.
I think it would be better to call this place a communal pool than a public pool.
I wonder why Haruhi chose this place.
There it is again.
It feels like I've seen this scene once before.
Where Nagato kind of looks like she's bored...
Kyon!
Right, and then Haruhi says this...
These two are my brigade members.
They'll do anything you ask, so ask for anything you want!
Okay, let's have some fun! We're going to play water soccer.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, deja vu isn't all that uncommon.
Here we go, Mikuru!
Summer outing, pool, Bon festival, fireworks show, part-time job, stargazing...
Summer outing, pool, Bon festival, fireworks show, part-time job, stargazing... I thought about what we'll be doing from here on. What do you think?
What is that?
It's a schedule of how we'll spend the rest of our short summer vacation.
I realized that we only have two weeks of summer vacation left.
That fact blew me away.
We still have so much left to do, but we've only got this much time left!
We're going to pick up the pace!
All this in just two weeks?
Is there anything else you want to do, Mikuru?
Umm... I'd like to try goldfish scooping.
Okay! Goldfish scooping...
Pardon me for a moment.
Thank you.
Is there a place nearby that's having a Bon festival?
- I'll check around. - Please do.
We're starting tomorrow.
We're done for today!
Nagato!
Umm... no, it's nothing important.
How have you been? Everything fine?
Fine.
T-That's good to hear.
Right.
What the heck? Why did I talk to her?
You can go now.
The next morning, it was a call from Haruhi that awoke me from my slumber.
They found a place that was holding a Bon festival.
We're all going to go buy yukata!
Both Mikuru and Yuki said that they don't own a yukata.
I don't own one either, and there's a place selling them in sets for cheap! Let's go!
Haruhi entered a women's clothing outlet store.
She just went and chose yukata for Miss Asahina and Nagato,
They made us wait for about an hour.
Ta-dah! They made us wait for about an hour.
Whoa, how blinding!
You all look wonderful.
Of course! I chose these yukata, after all.
Especially Mikuru!
It's so cute on you! Just what you would expect from my choice!
O-Of course.
Miss Asahina!
They have goldfish scooping, just like you wanted!
Be sure to catch a bunch!
A Bon festival, huh?
I guess it makes sense for there to be this many people.
It's been a while since I've come to one, but it feels like I have recently.
That tower, those vendors...
Shall we play, too? How about a competition?
Leave it to me!
I'll pass.
What about you, Nagato? Want to eat something?
You're interested in that stuff?
- Which one? - It's all right.
- This one. - Right-o, that'll be 800 yen.
I kind of got the feeling that Nagato had been helping us out,
so I thought it would be appropriate for me to at least buy her that, but...
Wow, what a haul! Thirteen!
But I don't need so many, so I just kept one.
And one for Mikuru, too.
You can have one, but only one.
Thanks.
What's with the mask, Yuki?
I bought it.
Huh. I see.
Now then, next up is fireworks! Let's launch some fireworks to end the day!
Fancy Fireworks Set Don't you understand the meaning of the word moderation?
It was summer, and summer vacation.
That's why I wanted to forget about it,
but there was one thing lingering in my mind.
Tomorrow we'll be catching bugs!
Haruhi.
It's fine to want to play around, but are you finished with your summer homework?
What? You can finish homework like that in just three days.
Three days!?
You get that stuff out of the way so you can have fun without having to worry about it.
That's how you enjoy your summer vacation.
Why is she so smart?
It seems like the guys up in heaven that were divvying up...
the stats for us were being pretty lax about it.
Everyone, tomorrow we'll be catching bugs!
Whoever catches the most bugs...
Okay, they'll get to be the brigade leader for a day!
No thanks!
That sounds interesting. Are any bugs okay?
Hmm... only cicadas!
That's it, this will be the SOS Brigade's Cicada Capturing Competition!
The next day was yet again a beautiful day.
It was on this day that we had the SOS Brigade Cicada Capturing Competition.
Now! It looks like each of us did try, in their own way,
It looks like each of us did try, in their own way,
but of course, or something to that effect, the winner ended up being Haruhi.
A catch and release attitude is important, right?
If we let them go, then they might come back to repay us.
What could a cicada do, even if it did come back?
For some reason, I kind of feel like Pandora opening her box.
The next day, we met up, even though we had no idea what was going on.
And we remained in the dark even as we were made to wear frog costumes,
and then pass out balloons in front of a supermarket as our part-time job.
It feels like I was just released from the Adzam's Leader Beam.
Good work, everyone.
What's with this difference in how we're being treated?
Thanks for the hard work. The manager is thankful.
I don't care about his thanks. Where's our pay?
This is it.
I've wanted this for a while.
The owner said that he'd give it to us for Mikuru's sake.
We worked, sweat pouring down our foreheads, for that?
Let's hang this up in the clubroom as a memento.
Mikuru, you can wear it whenever you want. You have my permission!
That night, a single phone call stole me away from my slumber.
Kyon...
Miss Asahina?
Yes, it's me...
At this rate, I...
- Umm... - Hello, this is Koizumi.
Why are you with Miss Asahina?
Certain circumstances came up.
Would it be possible for you to come join us right now?
What in the world happened, Miss Asahina?
Kyon, I... can't go back to the future...
In other words, this is what's going on.
We are going through an eternal loop of the same time period.
Even if you say something as impossible as that with a smile on your face...
Koizumi, do you realize what you're saying?
I do. Much more than I wish I did.
I had just been speaking with Miss Asahina.
Call me too, when you have talks with her.
And as a result, what we realized was that recently,
the flow of time was a bit strange.
You might want to credit this to Miss Asahina.
Thanks to her, I was able to confirm it.
Confirm what?
That we have experienced the same span of time numerous times.
You said that earlier.
To be precise, we've been repeating the time from August 17th to the 31st.
We're in the middle of an endless summer vacation.
Well, it is summer vacation, but...
It's a never-ending endless summer.
This world has lost all time after September 1st.
That is why Miss Asahina cannot go back to the future.
I suppose you could say that it's natural.
What's natural about there being no future? Who'd believe it?
We'd like for you to believe it.
Umm... I'll explain, too.
Well... because of classified information,
I'm always contacting the future and classified information-ing.
But I hadn't received any classified information
for about a week or so, and I thought, that's strange.
And so I classified information
I was so surprised, I tried to classified information,
but it was completely classified information.
Oh, what do I do?
I don't know what you should do, either, but I wonder,
are your classified informations things that cannot be said on television?
Are we trapped inside one of those closed spaces?
That's not it.
A single portion of time has been torn away.
At exactly the point when it becomes midnight on August 31st,
everything resets, and we go back to August 17th. That's the process.
So what about our... no, humanity's memories?
Those are reset as well. Everything starts over from the beginning.
So you mean that time does that thing that you mentioned.
Well, we do have someone from the future here, I guess it can't be helped.
Oh no, Miss Asahina isn't involved in this.
Okay then, what's the culprit?
I would guess Miss Suzumiya.
I'm sure she doesn't realize it, but somewhere inside of her
is a desire to not let summer vacation end.
What the heck? Do you mean she feels regret over something?
That's what I believe. Perhaps she feels that there's something left...
that she wants to do during our summer vacation?
Man, the hopeless situations she causes unfold on a galactic scale.
So, what are you saying I should do?
If we knew that, we would have this problem solved.
I've been wondering this since I got here, but you seem awfully cheerful about this.
It's because we've finally been able to solve the mystery
of the frequent feelings of deja vu that I've had recently,
and that you may have had, too.
Now that I think about it, those inexplicable feelings may have been
remnants from when our memories have been reset.
Is it possible that other people across the world feel this, too?
It doesn't seem that way. You and I are a special case.
It appears that the people who are closest to Miss Suzumiya
are able to sense this strangeness.
What about Haruhi? Does she sense any of this at all?
Not at all, it seems. It would probably be bad for us if she did.
However, I believe that there is one person who remembers everything,
more than the deja vu that we do.
And who would that be?
I think you know, even without my saying.
It's Miss Nagato.
I believe that the Thought Entity, which transcends time and space, would.
Is that right?
It is.
You remember all of it?
Right.
So, how many times have we repeated all of this, this time?
This is the 15,524th time.
15,524?
What do you mean by 15,524? Nagato, what are you saying?
Are you serious?
I am.
You're saying that we've done the exact same things that many times?
They're not all guaranteed to happen.
Out of 15,524 repetitions, there are two occasions,
2,391 and 11,054, where we did not go to a Bon festival.
A pattern where we did go to a Bon festival,
but did not go to a goldfish scooping stand, occurred 437 times.
- We had a part-time job... - I got it, that's enough.
15,524 times, that's what Nagato said.
Times two weeks, hmm, that's around 595 years.
She alone has memories of all that time,
repeating it all over and over.
Nagato, how must it feel to experience that same period of time over and over again?
I've heard yet another crazy story.
The next day, we went stargazing.
The location was Nagato's apartment,
and the telescope was one that Koizumi had gotten for us.
Oh, I'm bored of this. UFOs. Let's look for UFOs.
Exactly what does she want to do?
Now what could that be?
How about trying this out?
Give Miss Suzumiya a sudden embrace from behind,
then whisper I love you into her ear.
And who would be doing that?
Is there anyone else who could fill the role other than you?
I've been waiting to hear that!
Like hell I will.
All right, how about if I do it?
I'm kidding.
High speed
Home run
Next, we went off to a batting center.
Hey, Nagato, you were aware of this loop before Miss Asahina said anything, right?
Yes.
If that's the case, why didn't you say anything?
It's my job to observe.
All right!
I win again!
Yay!
Get us more time!
With this, we've finished everything on our list.
Hmm. I wonder if this was good enough.
But... I guess this works.
Hey, is there anything else you want to do?
That's fine, then.
We were able to do a lot this summer, so that's enough, right?
No, it's not. You're still not satisfied.
Okay, we're done for today.
I had tomorrow set aside just in case, but you can just take the day off.
Let's meet again in the clubroom the day after tomorrow.
W-Wait, Haruhi...
There it is again! That deja vu!
And it's a strong one, stronger than ever before.
I can't let Haruhi leave. If she goes,
we'll end up repeating these past two weeks for the some-thousandth time again.
But what should I do? What should I say?
What has she said up to this point?
I don't know... I can't remember...
August 31st. I haven't touched my homework.
Whatever, it doesn't matter anymore.
If we're just going to do it all over again, then there's no point to doing it.
Whether tomorrow comes or not, I'll leave it to the me at that time to deal with it.
