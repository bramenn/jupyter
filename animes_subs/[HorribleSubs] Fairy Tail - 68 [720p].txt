Jellal Fernandez...
I hereby place you under arrest for the crime of high treason against the state.
Please, wait!
A Guild for Only One.
Jellal has lost his memories!
He doesn't remember a thing!
By clause 13 of the criminal code, that is not a valid defense.
You can release them from the runes now.
But...!
It's okay. I have no intention of resisting.
I never was able to remember you...
I am truly sorry, Wendy...
She tells me that long ago, she was saved by you.
I see.
I do not know how much suffering I must have caused all of you.
But to hear that I saved someone makes me glad.
Erza.
Thank you for everything.
I must stop him.
It's for me to stop him.
Jellal is going away...
Jellal, finally awakened from his long nightmare, is...
How can I just let him be shut up in the darkness yet again?
Is there nothing left you wish to say?
It's pretty much guaranteed you'll be executed or given life without parole.
But that's...
You'll never see another human face again.
No...
I won't let you take him!
You ain't takin' him!
Natsu!
They're from the Council!
Why, you...
Move it!
He's our ally!
We're takin' him back with us!
Natsu-san...
L-Leave me be...
Restrain them!
Go, Natsu!
Gray?
There's no stopping Natsu now, after all!
It don't sit right!
He helped defend you from Nirvana!
And you don't got even one word of thanks?!
There is truth to that.
It is unjust to arrest a man like that!
It pains me to say it, but if that man is taken away, Erza-san will be saddened!
Don't blame me if anyone gets hurt!
Please! Don't take Jellal with you!
Come here, Jellal!
You can't leave Erza!
You've got to stay by her side! For her!
So come here! We stand with you!
We're allies, right?!
Arrest them all!
For obstructing government officials and aiding in the escape of a criminal!
Enough!
That's far enough!
I apologize for the fuss we've caused.
Jellal...
Take him.
Erza!
Sit down!
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, right...
It was the color of your hair.
Farewell, Erza.
Where did Erza go?
Let's leave her alone for a little while.
Aye...
To hear that I saved someone makes me glad.
Jellal Fernandez.
Whoa, that's hard to remember!
That name's gonna tie my tongue in knots!
Your name, Wally Buchanan, seems hard to remember, too.
Erza, how about you?
I am Erza.
Just plain Erza.
That's kind of sad...
What?
It's a pretty scarlet.
Scarlet?
I know! Let's name you Erza Scarlet!
Name you? Don't just go naming other people...
Scarlet...
Erza Scarlet...
Scarlet. The color of your hair.
That way, I'll never forget.
Jellal...
That morning's dawn
was painted a beautiful scarlet,
the likes of which I had never seen before.
Like the color of Erza's hair,
it was warm, and passionate...
If she could only lift her face, a beautiful sky would be spread out before her...
If she could only lift her face...
So cute!
Oh? I'm far cuter.
The entire village here is part of the guild,
so clothing production is a thriving business!
Is it some kind of Nirvit traditional sewing?
Now that I think about it... Maybe it is?
You didn't realize that the guild was all descendants of the Nirvit, did you?
Well, I'm the only one who joined afterwards.
Erza, won't you try them on? They're really cute!
Sure... You're right.
Speaking of which, Wendy... When did Caitshelter join the League of Guilds?
I apologize for being blunt, but until this mission began,
I had not even heard your guild's name.
Now that you mention it, neither had I.
Is that so?
My guild must really be one of the more obscure ones...
Who cares? Everyone is waiting...
Fairy Tail...
Blue Pegasus...
Lamia Scale...
Also, Wendy and Carla.
You have done well in defeating Oracion Seis and stopping Nirvana.
As a representative for the local League of Guilds,
I, Robaul, say job well done.
Thank you.
Nabula!
Thank you!
It was our pleasure, Master Robaul!
The fight with Oracion Seis was one fierce battle after the next!
There was not a single easy battle!
But the bonds between us allies
led us on the path to victory!
You said it, Sensei!
Men.
Oh sure, just take all the good parts for yourself.
Men.
Did he even fight anyone?
It's finally over...
You two did well yourself!
Jura-san...
You're supposed to throw a party now, right?
Aye, sir!
Ichiya...
Ichiya...
A party?
And off go the clothes!
You, too!
Now... Everyone from Caitshelter, join in!
Everyone...
I am truly sorry about hiding our legacy as Nirvit.
You ruined the mood to say that?
We really don't mind at all.
Right?
Right!
Master, I don't mind either.
Everyone, please listen carefully to what I am about to say.
To start, we are not the descendants of the Nirvit.
We are the Nirvit themselves!
400 years ago, it was I who created Nirvana.
What?
No way!
400 years ago?
400 years ago, in order to stop the war that was raging across the world,
I created Nirvana, a magic that inverts light and darkness.
Nirvana became our country,
and, for a time, we realized peace.
However...
Great power will, without fail, give rise to a great power opposing it.
As much as Nirvana changed darkness for light, Nirvana itself became wrapped in darkness.
It was to maintain balance.
It was impossible to change people's personalities to light without limit.
As light rises to oppose the darkness,
so does darkness rise to oppose the light, without fail.
Now that you mention it...
The darkness lost from the various peoples came back upon us Nirvit.
No...
It was hell.
We killed each other... Until no one was left.
I am the only survivor.
Well, at this point, that's not exactly right.
My physical body has long perished... I am what you might call a spectral form now.
Or rather, a weak ghost trying to atone for his sins of the past.
I watched over Nirvana for 400 years until someone appeared who would be able to destroy it.
And now...
W-What are you saying...?
What is this?
Everyone?
All of you!
Magna! Pepel!
What's going on here?
They're all disappearing!
No! Everyone!
I don't want you to disappear!
I apologize for deceiving you...
All the members of the guild are illusions created by me.
Say what?!
Illusions with their own personalities?
What incredible magic power!
7 years ago, a single boy came here.
Please, take care of this girl!
I couldn't turn down the request of that boy and his fierce, honest eyes.
Even though I had promised myself I would stay alone...
Mister, where am I?
T-This is...
Jellal?
He said he was taking me to a guild...
T-This is a guild!
This is a Wizard's Guild!
Really?
Nabula!
Try going outside!
You have friends waiting for you.
And so I also created an illusory family.
The guild was created all for Wendy?
I don't wanna hear that!
Bask, Naoki, don't you disappear too!
Wendy, Carla... You no longer need a foster family.
Don't you have real friends now?
Your future... has only just begun.
Master!
Everyone, truly, thank you.
I leave Wendy and Carla in your hands.
Master!
Bury the pain of losing your loved ones... into the arms of your friends.
Come.
To Fairy Tail.
It feels like it's been a while since we've been back to the guild.
No kidding!
We can finally take it easy!
Actually, it doesn't look like we can.
I heard there's a person that saw a dragon!
Seriously?!
Could that dragon be Igneel?
Maybe it's the Dragon that Wendy and Carla are looking for!
Next time: Call of the Dragon.
Oh yeah... What was the name of the dragon they were looking for again?
I'm pretty sure it's Wendine.
Uh, I think you're mixed up.
