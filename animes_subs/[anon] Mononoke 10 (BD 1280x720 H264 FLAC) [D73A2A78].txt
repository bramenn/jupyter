OP
Fukuju Subway Station Grand Opening
The blue moon illuminated
your wandering shadow.
I could never tell you all I wanted to say.
It was so very frustrating.
I think about your faked smile,
and forget all the hot tears we shed.
What do these empty husks,
those empty eyes of yours, reflect, my dear?
The transient quarter moon
hides in a rift in the clouds,
as darkness seeps up from the ground.
Tell me the truth, please.
Are you so despondent
that you still sit alone, sighing?
Without you, I just cant smile.
I walk this banal town,
feeling such intense emotions.
I know that if I could treasure them and live on,
I would need nothing else.
The summer flowers that bloomed in the sky
Come falling down, dancing in the wind.
I can barely recall the night sky
where they all came tumbling down,
so what I can still recall is all the more precious.

It is with great pride that I open this subway station for business.
Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Sir, we should get going.
Sir, we should get going.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you! Thank you!
Everyone on the platform, please stand back!
Well need to see your tickets before boarding!
Dont push! No pushing, please.
Um, is this where car number four will be boarding?
Um, no, its not.
This is the first car.
Only VIPs can get in there.
Over there.
Aw, all that way?
Whats with him?
Oh my, that huge pack must be heavy!
He looks kind of handsome, though.
He must be one of those sandwich board advertisers.
Yeah, looks like it. Thank you so much, sir!
Excuse me! Sorry!
Excuse me!
Sorry!
Sorry!
Stand back! Stand back!
Excuse me, everyone. Let me through.
Hey, wait!
Thank you for providing security, Detective.
Aw man. Its not fair!
I want to ride up there, with the mayor!
Excuse me.
Will the train be back by this afternoon?
It loops back after four stops, so it should be less than an hour.
Well, this is a banner day!
Four more minutes!
Id like to embark on the second stage as soon as possible.
Of course! I trust you implicitly, sir.
You have our full support.
Im Moria, from the Morning News.
Allow me to congratulate you on the new station.
How do you feel right now?
Im extremely pleased to meet the expectations of my citizens.
I suppose thats most of what Im feeling.
Well said, sir! Well said, indeed!
What suck-ups.
What suck-ups.
Hey, ink-slinger, lets leave it at that, shall we?
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!
This trains atmosphere is so pleasant, isnt it?
Yes, it is indeed.
The riff-raff on my last ride were so unpleasant.
Yes, well they are all rather rank.
I could barely breathe!
And the very first train, to boot!
I could hardly believe I won the drawing.
Ive so been looking forward to this.
Yes, so have I!
Was there an accident?
All right. Everyone remain calm.
Oh wow!
Geez.
What?
What? What? Wha
Was it my imagination?
Mr. Mayor?
Wheres everyone else?
Whered they go?
How did
Theyre all gone.
Oh, thank you so much for earlier!
Oh, not at all.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
We have discovered a foreign object blocking the tracks,
Where is this?
The first car.
The first car?
and are taking the necessary precautions.
Hey, you!
What are you doing here?
Hey, its nothing to shout about.
Dont be rude to the passengers.
But
Surely none of them have any insight into these strange occurrences.
Ill
return to my seat, then.
Ill be going, too!
Its too heavy!
I cant budge it.
Uh. Let me try it!
Useless women.
This is Kinoshita, the driver.
Station One, come in.
Thats strange.
Allow me.
Thank you!
Old man just cant contain himself, can he?
Whats the matter?
Why arent we moving?
Hey, you!
Whats going on?
Thank you so much!
Ill have to have it modified so that anyone can open it.
Where are the other cars?
Mr. Mayor?
Whos driving this thing?
Ill never forgive you.
Did you just say you wouldnt forgive me?
Did you just say you wouldnt forgive me?
Did anyone say that?
No.
It was just my imagination.
Oh no, how scary!
My imagination
Whats the matter with this train?
Whats the matter with this train?
Arent you in control?
Ive used every tool at my disposal!
We cant even contact the surface.
Ill never get promoted now.
I thought that today would go so well.
Were in the tunnel the whole way, so it really is pretty scary.
Were in the tunnel the whole way, so it really is pretty scary.
Were in the tunnel the whole way, so it really is pretty scary.
10:05 a.m., sudden stop.
Passengers vanish. Cause unknown.
Hey Newsman, dont you get sick if you write on the train?
Ive been doing my job for twenty years. Im quite used to it.
Whats wrong, boy?
Goodness! Dont scare me like that!
Um
There was just a
Here it is.
Who are you?
Its the Sandwich Board Man.
Newsman!
How?
Therere no other cars back there.
Howd you get in here?
As you saw,
I came from the next car along.
I am a medicine seller.
Huh?
I have to dress like this these days, for my wares to sell.
Still, its awfully pretty.
You saw that, didnt you?
I dont know why, but we cant get out of the door from here.
Just a minute ago, the mayor
Fell out.
Dont finish his sentences! Thats creepy!
The trains moving of its own accord.
Its as though a fox spirit has a hold of it.
This is not a fox spirits doing.
I know that.
Its just a figure of speech.
The mayor
was killed by a Mononoke.
A Mononoke?
Stop that! Dont be creepy!
Get your craziness out of here!
It was an accident, thats all!
But the trains moving on its own.
Of course it was an accident!
Of course it was an accident!
Hes yelling again.
You didnt see anything!
I can tell
even without having seen.
It moved by itself!
What are those?
Theyre scales.
Theyre scales.
Their alignment
tells me the Mononokes position.
tells me the Mononokes position.
tells me the Mononokes position.
You are all connected.
The Mononoke has placed all those involved in this car.
Connected? Were all meeting for the first time.
Thats right!
I just won my ticket in a raffle!
How would you say were connected?
You should all know that.
I think I do know one of you!
What?
Me too. I remember one person.
I remember one of you, as well.
Me too.
Who, then?
You too?
I dont know anyone.
Yeah, Ive no idea what this is about, either.
My.
To think that four of the six here recognize the same person.
Would you all be able to tell me more?
I dont remember any of them.
Oh, right!
Lets have all your names, ages and professions, along with where you say you met me.
Yes, right. Thats a good idea.
Im Nomoto Chiyo, aged twenty-one.
Im a waitress at a cafe across from the station!
A shining example of a career woman.
Well, yeah.
Dont be ridiculous!
I never went to that cafe!
Yes you did!
You came in on an investigation, didnt you, Detective?
When was this?
Three or four months ago, right?
Yeah, exactly!
Hey, how did
Oh, Detective!
You were outside smoking while your partner questioned me, so I didnt recognize you.
Ah. Im Yamaguchi Haru, a widow.
Age?
Dont be rude.
Thirty-five.
You didnt have to tell him.
And what happened to your husband?
He died five years ago of an illness of the lungs.
I currently live with my mother-in-law.
Just the facts, maam!
You really dont remember?
Unlike you, Im a busy man!
I cant remember everyone I meet. Now, say when you met me!
Lets see, what cures amnesia?
You have to give your name and age first, Detective.
Youre a willful young woman.
Kadowaki Shakei, forty years old.
Im a police officer.
Then Ill give you a hint.
It was about a regular customer at our shop.
One of those Modern Girls, they call them.
Thats not all. She was totally gorgeous, too!
I was so jealous!
Unfortunately, though, she got hit by a train and died.
I didnt mean to!
I didnt mean to.
Morning News. Train accident.
Morning News. Train accident.
Oh, that!
Thats right. I remember. You were driving at the time, werent you?
Your name was
Kinoshita Bunpei, twenty-eight.
It was just an accident!
She jumped off the bridge, killing herself, and my train just happened to be passing through.
Jumped off
I told you then, I didnt mean to do it!
I told you then, I didnt mean to do it!
We get it! Calm down. It wasnt your fault.
We determined it was a clear suicide.
I see.
So, thats it.
You look a bit pale.
Shall I make you a tonic?
No, Im fine.
And who are you?
Moria Kioshi.
Normally I have a desk job at a newspaper, but they were shorthanded today and sent me out in the field.
He was the victims boss.
She was a writer, then? How nice.
She was pretty famous, if I remember.
What was her name?
I remember her now!
Ichikawa Setsuko!
I was so jealous that she had her name in the paper!
This is some mistake!
I dont know any of you!
Why do I have to stay locked in here?
Let me off, please!
What does he mean?
I wonder.
Hey, whats your name?
Kobayashi Masao.
Where do you go to school?
I just graduated from elementary school, and I work delivering milk.
It must be hard, so early in the morning.
Morning?
If I remember correctly, it was about 5 a.m. when my train passed under the bridge.
Kirigahara Bridge, eh?
A delivery boy, you say.
Thats right.
The dots are finally connected.
Oh.
My word.
There was a woman holding a cat, there.
There was a woman holding a cat, there.
Its a Ghost Cat.
