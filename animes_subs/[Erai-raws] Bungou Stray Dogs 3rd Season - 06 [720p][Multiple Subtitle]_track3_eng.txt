I may have needed more soy sauce.
I may have needed more soy sauce.
I don't like abilities that act on their own.
It's okay.
Demon Snow saved us once before, after all.
That said, she killed Kyouka-chan's parents.
If Demon Snow were human, I could sever her third cervical nerve to stop her from reaching.
Kyouka-chan's knowledge scares me.
This is the wanted list the military police sends us every month.
And these are our regular bodyguard clients.
It's fine. I memorized all of them.
Really?
It took me a month.
I-I forgot...
She works at this shop.
What's good on the menu today?
Dark-roasted muddy water!
She's Lucy, an ex-Guild member.
She works here as a live-in waitress now, for some reason.
You.
Yes?
Do you have any idea why I'm here?
To take revenge.
On you.
You'd better remember why.
But you saved me on the Moby Dick before.
Hot milk.
With sugar.
Episode 31 Part 1
Herurisu!
If you don't remember why I'm taking revenge on you,
I'll seriously strangle you to death.
Don't worry.
If she does something, I'll cut her down first.
Did I do something wrong?
I thought we understood each other.
Speaking of which, I'd forgotten...
Some weirdo came and left this request for the Detective Agency.
It's not for you.
It's for the little shrimp there.
Me?
The request is...
to deliver a briefcase containing a large sum of money to a specified company.
Danger No Swimming
Apparently, the briefcase is on board one of these boats.
But which one?
Did they omit something by mistake?
It doesn't say anything about which boat.
We'll have to split up and search.
Danger
No Swimming
You're right.
Fool!
You're trespassing, you little brat!
I'm sorry!
This sucks.
I'm going to get reported if I keep searching like this.
In a bind, thievish kitty?
Ta-da.
You pulled the page out?
Of course I did.
How would it be revenge if I'd given you all of it?
What's with the face?
Don't tell me you still don't know why I'm angry.
N-No, of course I do.
It's because, uhh...
You don't like my bangs.
Are you mental?!
Listen. Don't you remember what I said when I helped you escape from the Moby Dick?
Save me from this place someday.
I'll be waiting.
All right.
Yet look what you've done!
W-Wait!
You were taken straight to the ground from the Moby Dick.
I couldn't have saved you.
Then couldn't you have at least said something when we met again?
Want the page?
Swim for it, you thievish cat.
An old mooring chain...
Danger No Swimming
What's taking him so long?
Wait, you're joking, right?
Are you an idiot or something?
You're the gifted who defeated the Guild.
Could you please not drown right by the shore like that?
Where am I?
I transported you out of the water and into Anne's room.
My ability doesn't work unless I'm close to my target.
Now I'm a wet rat, too!
Thanks.
I owe you again.
Sorry.
I was planning to save you during the Moby Dick infiltration.
But I ended up being chased down by Akutagawa,
and there was only so much time before it crashed.
I tried my best to find you.
You looked for me?
I was so relieved when I realized you weren't there.
Saying it was for revenge was just an excuse.
The real reason I started that job
was to apologize for not waiting like I promised.
A-And...
Oh, no.
I can't finish work when my clothes are so wet.
I know.
If you can transport just a person's body from the water,
could you transport just the moisture from wet clothes?
Huh?
What I mean is...
First, you return the two of us to reality,
and then re-transport just the two of us and our clothes, without the moisture.
Poof
Poof
That way, we can switch back into our dry clothes instantly.
Don't blame me if it doesn't work out.
Another all-nighter, Ango-senpai?
What's the situation?
A Special Operations Division document transport vehicle was attacked.
They stole our reports.
One attacker.
We're told they were dressed like a postal worker.
Attacking a Special Operations Division armed transport vehicle alone...
They must be quite skilled.
Which report did they take?
Document Number E-7581A.
Why would they take that one?
What's it about?
Investigation records that would reduce her punishment.
It's a record of the ability Demon Snow, and her parents whom she killed.
Ability aside, why the parents?
The parents were on our side.
She has her parents' talent.
That's the boat that was on the page.
I don't trust you.
I don't want your trust.
Whose trust do you want, then?
Here.
It's the briefcase mentioned in the request.
There's nothing inside.
I didn't steal it!
There's something in the bottom.
Investigation Report
Employment Gift
Employment Gift?
The report described the events of the day Kyouka-chan's parents died.
Do you know what your parents did for work?
I don't know.
Three Years Ago
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm just glad I didn't have to work too late.
Dinner's delicious, and I get to be with you and our daughter.
This is the greatest...
moment of my life.
Kyouka-chan's father was a former government spy.
Her mother was gifted with Demon Snow, a murderous ability.
She and her husband were involved in countless assassinations.
My body's moving on its own.
Kill me!
It's an ability that uses blood as a medium for mind control.
Demon Snow...
Protect my daughter!
Go, Kyouka.
Your mother will always be by your side.
Her parents were struck down by a gifted who had a score to settle with them.
The government, unable to make her parents' existence public,
treated it as a case of her having lost control of her ability.
But Demon Snow is my ability.
I've heard that there's a way to transfer abilities to family members.
It seems your mother learned how to do that
from a gifted who controlled black shadows.
But because it was a sudden attack and the transfer was partial,
Demon Snow can only be controlled using that cell phone.
A few days before my parents were killed,
Mother gave me this phone and told me to never let go of it.
That's why she never let go of her cell phone, even after she joined the Port Mafia.
What I saw that day...
Demon Snow didn't kill them.
Kyouka-chan, if there's anything I
That hurts. Jeez.
You're so dense.
She resented her ability for killing her parents,
when in fact it was the embodiment of her parents' love.
Give her some time to herself.
Her parents' love...
But who put that report in the briefcase?
I heard the news.
Apparently you used six month's worth of operating budget
to obtain information from the Special Operations Division.
How generous.
I suppose.
It's her new employment gift.
It's money well spent.
Episode 31 Part 2
Portait of a Father
Atsushi-kun!
Over here.
Sorry, I'm filling in for Rampo-san.
Filling in?
What about Rampo-san?
Well...
Hey, Atsushi.
Gather'round!
Investigation Partnership Request
Rampo E.
Investigation of truck collision and unidentified man in Miyagawa, Noge City
Can you go do this for me?
But the request is for you.
I can't.
My baked snacks are nice and fresh right now.
Oh, well. That can't be helped.
Yeah.
So...
The victim is a male in his forties.
He was struck by the truck and died on impact.
His face was destroyed, so we don't know who he is yet.
According to the driver, he jumped out onto the road.
It's a newspaper article.
There might be more around here.
Super mystery solver!
Huh?
No good.
I can't figure anything out.
Speaking of solving mysteries, before I left, Rampo-san said...
This is your case now, but I'll give you one piece of advice.
If you get stumped, find a flower shop.
A flower shop?
Yes.
A flower shop.
Tanizaki-san.
Coming.
A flower shop, huh?
Atsushi-kun.
They've identified the victim from his fingerprints.
This is him.
Atsushi-kun?
Why?
Why are you here?
Why, Headmaster?!
I can't believe it.
The headmaster is dead.
Are you all right?
You can take a break if it's too painful.
Painful?
Why?
I feel absolutely great.
That headmaster is dead!
The reason behind the nightmares that haunt me every night is gone!
Aren't you curious to know why your headmaster was in town?
I don't even want to know.
Back then, I lived every day of my life abandoned.
Nobody expected anything of me.
I never even knew who I was.
Do you hate me?
Do you know why you've been locked up?
Because you hate me.
No.
It's because I became a tiger and wreaked havoc.
Atsushi, resent me.
One day, you'll leave for the outside world.
When you do, Atsushi, hate me.
Never hate yourself.
Atsushi-kun, the rest of the article the victim had was
on the other side of the road.
Find!
Giant Flying Object Over Yokohama
Crashes Into Port!
It was you the headmaster was looking for.
He came to Yokohama after he saw this article.
It's a gossip article and photos of the battle with the Guild
the Special Operations Division failed to cover up.
I got more information out of the orphanage staff, too.
The headmaster learned about your work from this article.
He probably wanted to wish you
Lies!
That's not possible!
Absolutely not!
He would never...
Atsushi-kun...
Are you happy with this, Dazai-san?
Does it hurt to see kids with their parents?
Dazai-san, do you remember when you first met me?
Sure.
That was when we were looking for the tiger.
Why do you think the headmaster didn't tell anyonee that I was the tiger?
At the very least, it's certain that maintaining
the secret would have taken serious effort.
Especially to keep you from realizing, too.
Find a flower shop.
Rampo-san was right.
He had an appointment at a flower shop.
Headmaster was going to buy a bouquet of flowers before he met me.
And...
Still, I can't forgive him.
I really...
I really suffered.
There's nothing he could do to make me forgive him.
You don't need to forgive him.
No matter what he may have believed,
what he did to you was unforgivable. Absolute barbarism.
You were truly in hell,
but that hell raised you properly.
If I could save them...
the passengers here...
If I could get them back safe and sound to their homes...
Wouldn't that mean...
Wouldn't that mean it's okay for me to live?
As someone who understands suffering,
you resisted violence and evil
and saved many people who were in positions of weakness.
Dazai-san...
This feeling that's overflowing inside me...
This feeling...
What is this?
There's no one who can fully grasp the deepest feelings of another person.
You can only get the sense that you have.
When someone's father dies, they tend to cry.
