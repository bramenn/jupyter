Hey. Morning.
Hi.
Huh? Don't you have anything to say about my winter uniform?
What do you want so early in the day?
I thought I'd walk to school with you.
You tend to stand out, so I'd rather not.
I told the girls about work yesterday.
They were so surprised.
An actress?!
Can I get an autograph?
You? Seriously?
When's the movie coming out?!
I bet.
Still...
It's a load off my shoulders.
Midterm Exams
The midterms will begin next week.
Just so you know,
any scores below thirty will be deemed failing grades, as always.
Be sure to revise, and revise well.
So the time has come...

Itsuki.
What do you want?
Wow, you're studying during a break.
Good on you!
What?
I hear you're studying at home, too.
I can tell because we're classmates.
You're the most studious of the quints.
You think so?
Yeah!
It's just that you're stupid!
So stop being stubborn
and join the study group.
I'm sure even you could improve your grades.
You're right.
There's definitely a limit to what I can do alone.
Could you help me with this question?
Of course.
All right.
Come to the staff room later.
Thank you, Sensei.
I'm not giving up.
Next!
Nino!
Are you ready for the midterms?
Let's go, girls.
Hey, wasn't that guy calling you?
He's a stalker.
Yikes.
Nino! I'm not giving up!
You were happy to go along with it back at the festival, weren't you?
Just think about it.
We can do it at your place if we have to.
One more time!
Just give me one more chance!
There's so much I can teach you, Nino!
I swear I'll satisfy you!
Do you get it... now?
You're going to give people the wrong idea!
She really got you good.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Never mind that.
Uesugi-san!
Here's a question!
What's different about me today?
I'm assuming you've heard that the midterms are coming up.
He ignored me!
Listen...
Hint: it's somewhere above my neck.
Unless you do better, there's no way you're going to survive the exams.
Ta-da!
The answer is that my ribbon has a different pattern than usual.
I heard checks are in right now.
Your answer sheets are full of checks, too.
Congratulations.
Yay! I'm leading the trend!
Ichika.
You're not one to be laughing.
At least Yotsuba is willing to work at it.
We have a week until midterms.
We're going to prepare thoroughly for them!
What did you expect?
And Miku, you need to work not only on Japanese history...
What?
Miku's studying English, her worst subject, and without being forced to!
Do you have a fever?
I'm fine.
I just felt like trying for once.
Miku...
All right, everyone, let's do this!
Yeah!
Be quiet!
Yes, ma'am.
I'm so tired.
I can't wait to get home.
Damn it, after school isn't enough time.
How much can we cram in during the weekend?
I-Ichika!
We don't need to work that hard, do we?
It's not like we're going to wind up getting expelled over a midterm.
We're going to do our best.
Have patience with us.
I mean, if you're going to give us a reward, we'll try harder.
Oh, I know!
I'd like that fruit parfait by the station.
I want matcha parfait.
I'm starting to want some, too.
Let's invite the others and go right now.
I thought you couldn't wait to get home.
Maybe I don't need to freak out too much.
Uesugi-san!
Hurry up, or we'll leave you behind!
Hold it!
You...
I can't believe you would go home in that situation.
You were supposed to go with them!
No, I need to go home and study.
What? You chased me down just to tell me that?
No.
I was asked to get you on the phone.
Me?
It's me, Itsuki.
I'll put him on now.
Hello?
Uesugi-kun, correct?
Thanks for taking care of my daughters.
F-F-Father! Nice to finally speak to you.
Thank you for everything.
You have no reason to call me father.
You have no reason to call him father.
I'm sorry I haven't been able to show up at all.
I trust that the tutoring has been going well.
Of course, we're in the middle of it right now.
Wait up, Itsuki. I'll tell you the answer to that later.
They're all good girls.
I'm sure they'll be fine if they keep it up.
That's good to hear.
I've heard the midterms are coming up.
I'm glad you're making good progress.
Midterm Exams
This is a little harsh,
but I'd like you to show me results.
If any of the five fail their upcoming midterms,
I'll have you tender your resignation as their tutor.
Fired
Fired?!
I wish you all the best.
P-Please reconsider!
Isn't it a bit too early to decide?!
Damn it!
That's my phone!
I know.
Sorry.
What did my father say?
J-Just idle chitchat.
And that was enough to make you sweat buckets?
Why don't you stop worrying about me and start worrying about yourself?
I hope you're preparing for the midterms.
N-No problems there.
No problems, my foot.
You did badly on that quiz today, didn't you?
You looked?!
So she did do badly.
She'd be pissed off if I said that.
I'm sure she's doing her best.
Say, Itsuki...
Let me know if there's anything you need help with.
What's your problem?
Do you not believe me?
Great. Now she's mad.
I told you I don't need your help.
You work hard, but you're slow.
Let me help you,
and I'll teach you well.
Learn from Ichika and Miku a little!
You may have forgotten,
but I did ask you to help me at first.
You were the one who turned me down.
I don't need your half-hearted help.
So you think you can pass without any help?
I can, even if it's too late for these midterms.
That's not good enough!
If you fail these midterms, it's over!
This is my job.
Quit fussing and accept it.
You're the one being fussy.
Don't you want better grades?
So just shut up and listen to me!
N-No... That was...
I was starting to respect you a little.
It looks like I shouldn't have.
So you're just doing it for the money.
What's wrong with that?
Who would care about a stubborn brat like you if it wasn't for work?
You don't need to force yourself to teach me.
I don't exist to make money for you.
Oh, really?
Don't blame me if you regret it.
Sure.
Even if it means getting expelled,
I'm never having you teach me!
I'm never teaching you!
Why did I say that?!
I'm never teaching you!
You screw up at work! You're fired, and now you're unemployed.
Fired!
Fired
My neck is on the line.
This is no time to be getting in a fight.
Maybe I should just be honest.
Uesugi-san.
I got married!
Gift money, please.
Oh, right.
Thank you.
I'm up next.
Even in a game, I'm poor...
We don't have time for this!
Break's over!
Let's get back to work.
But we studied a lot today.
My head's about to explode.
It's not good to overdo it.
That's true, but...
Futaro...
You seem more desperate than usual.
Are we really that far behind?
No, well...
Actually...
Hey, you're not even studying. You're just playing games.
I'm in.
Switch spots with me.
Futaro...
Actually, what?
Oh, nothing.
Jeez, you have almost no money.
Just imagine what would happen if she found out.
It's so obvious what she would try to do.
Want to join us?
Itsuki?
About yesterday, I...
I have to study.
H-Hey.
Come on.
You're done tutoring for the day, aren't you?
Go home.
Hey, wait!
Get going.
Nino.
Leave already!
Shoot.
I told you to leave!
This is going to get us nowhere.
Hold on, Futaro-kun.
That's not what you promised.
You said you were going to stay overnight to help us study.
What?
What?!
It's so big.
Why did Ichika help me out like that, though?
Anyway, I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
I just need time. She'll come around.
Uesugi-kun, it's me, Itsuki.
Ichika said there's something you wanted to tell me.
What is it?
Me?
I never said anything.
I see.
All right, then.
Wait, I'm kidding.
Thanks for coming.
What is it that you wanted to tell me?
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I panicked and got emotional.
Please let me teach you.
What happened, exactly?
If any of you get a failing grade,
I'm going to be forced to quit tutoring you.
So that's what it was.
Itsuki! Why would you open the door?!
You've seen me naked before.
So now we're even.
I've been wondering why you and Itsuki have been acting weird.
You're fired if we fail, huh?
That's good to know.
Uesugi-san's been in the bath for a while.
I'm sure he's savoring the water that five beautiful girls bathed in.
Bath...
Want to go get him?
You might as well make a move on him while he's here.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Uesugi-san!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Shall we start studying for the exams?
Wh-Why don't you join us, Nino?
I don't need to.
Now what?
Nino would love it if someone failed and I got fired.
She's never going to try to study.
If anything, she'll do everything in her power not to study.
Damn it, Nino...
Futaro-sensei!
About this question...
Which one?
Okay, scooch over.
Dude!
Miku says she needs help with something, too.
Ichika!
Sure, I'll answer that.
Ask me anything.
Okay!
Yotsuba-kun.
What's a synonym for argument?
Good question.
Debate.
Remember it like de ba te.
Debate.
De ba te.
That one's going to be on the exam for sure.
Hear that, Nino?
I can make myself useful.
I want to learn...
What kind of girls do you like?
Does that matter right now?
I have a comment!
I'm kind of interested.
Why...
Uesugi Futaro's
Top 3 Qualities in a Girl
I'll teach you, then, if you really want to know.
The top three qualities I look for in a girl.
But I'm only revealing one for every page you fill.
Good thing they're so easy to manipulate.
Okay!
Done!
All right.
Number three...
Drumroll...
Always cheerful
Bam!
Always cheerful.
Okay, done.
Number two...
Drumroll...
Good at cooking
Bam!
Good at cooking.
I'm done.
Good.
Number one...
Drumroll...
Ba-dump Ba-dump
Bam!
Cares about her brother
Cares about her brother.
Cares about her brother
You're talking about your sister!
What, Nino?
You should stop listening in and join us.
I can hear you, even if I don't want to.
Hey!
It was Raiha-chan?!
We worked so hard! No fair!
I'm the total opposite.
I told you my stance on the matter.
I'm not interested in dating.
Oh, wow.
Miku's already done her assignment.
You have to praise people when they do well, Futaro-kun.
There.
Good job.
There, there.
Well?
Get your heart racing?
Not really.
Yotsuba, check him!
S-Stop it! Yotsuba!
Stop running away!
Get lost! Don't come near me!
Oh, come on.
Knock it off already!
Wow!
Uesugi-san's heart's racing!
Obviously, after all that running!
You're so noisy.
I thought a study group would be quieter.
Sorry.
It's hard to apologize when I'm actually facing her.
Miku, may I borrow your headphones?
Sure, but why?
I want to focus by myself.
This girl...
Itsuki!
Can I trust you?
I don't want to hold you back.
Look, Futaro-kun, the stars are pretty.
What?
Let's take a break.
Come with me.
Hey.
Ietsuna Tsunayoshi Ienobu
Ietsuna.
Tsunayoshi.
Ienobu.
I see.
Ietsuna.
Tsunayoshi.
Ietsuna.
You repeated one.
Um...
Ietsunayoshi Ienobu.
Now you combined them.
Did you get in a fight with Itsuki-chan or something?
It's the same thing as always.
It is, isn't it?
You and Itsuki-chan end up fighting every time you see each other.
You two are too alike.
Too alike? Says the identical quint.
But it felt different today.
I want you two to fight like friends, like you usually do.
That's self-contradictory.
Is it?
I think she's just being stubborn.
Aren't you the same way?
She's always been awkward.
I think she's just having a hard time being upfront.
I'm sure she's hurting on her own right now.
I'll do what I can,
but there are some things that only you can do,
so I'm counting on you.
Oh.
You five were born at nearly the same time,
so I thought it didn't matter in your case...
But you actually are the oldest sister.
What's up with the hand?
You were the one who told me to do that.
It's cold. Let's go inside.
Huh?
Is it cold?
Okay, you can use my bed.
So this is what they call a bed.
Not bad.
What's wrong?
Bathroom.
Wh-Why?!
Next Time on The Quintessential Quintuplets
07 Liar McLieface
Quintuplet trivia!
Itsuki-chan's the biggest eater of the five of us.
Why would you say that?!
That's defamation!
All I've had today is a bowl of katsudon!
Oh, right.
It's only eight in the morning, though.
