Sword of the Holy Man
Sword of the Holy Man
Next Time
The Valliere Sisters
You'll go no matter what?
Yeah.
Montmorency, I'm headed off to join the army now.
I want you to see me off with a smile.
A smile?
Even if you might die when you go off to war?
To die protecting one's country...
Is this not the most honourable death for an aristocrat?
Who cares about honour?!
If you die, we'll never see each other again!
Do you... care that much about me?
Of course.
Montmorency.
Guiche.
It looks like the army really is going to march into Albion.
They drafted all the boys in the academy.
It's rough being an aristocrat, eh?
Hold on...
If all the boys were drafted,
that leaves me as the sole remaining young male in the academy.
What are you imagining?
Hey, what's that?
A dragon?
He's so handsome!
Oh, my.
Montmorency?
Oh, you're still here?
D-Don't give me that...
My name is Julio Chesare.
I am a transfer student from Romalia.
Pleased to meet you.
As you can see,
the colour of a flame becomes fainter as its temperature rises.
Do you see?
There are several metals that cannot be processed without a hot flame.
They say he's a flamen from Romalia, so he isn't joining the military
Flamen?
Why come to a magic academy?
I don't know.
Who cares as long as he's handsome.
Damn it.
All the girls are looking at him.
Is the blondie that good?
Better than a dog I know.
Do you want to be popular that badly?
N-Not really.
How about you? Aren't you interested in him?
W-Why me?
Agnes?
Everyone, out to the field, now.
W-Who are you people?
Her Highness' Musketeer Force.
We have been stationed at this school in order to provide you with military drills.
Class is cancelled.
Cancelled?
Assemble in the field.
Everyone, please take your seats.
We are continuing the class.
Teacher, we are in the midst of war.
It is not a time to be holding classes.
It is because we are in a war that we must learn how foolish it is.
All the boys have joined the military,
but I would like you to not bring war onto this campus!
Silence!
I hate mages...
especially those who use fire.
Hate mages?
Do not interfere with my duties.
Out to the field!
Saito.
To attention!
We will now begin the training.
Hold on!
We're mages!
We don't need this kind of thing.
Let's practice practical magic, whether offensive or defensive.
Magic, eh?
Go ahead.
Defeat me using magic.
What is wrong?
Y-You're hurting me!
Can't you do anything once you get your wand taken away?
If I were an enemy, you would be dead.
L-Let go of me!
You never know what might happen in a real battle.
Even with a wand in your hand, you may not have enough time to cast your spell.
Listen.
These are the very basics.
Skills with which to protect yourself.
Begin!
Practice with us.
Hey, how about a private lesson with me?
I am sorry, but my partner has already been chosen.
So, who's your partner?
No way!
Miss Valliere.
Actually, may I call you Louise?
Well, come at me.
Come on.
Okay.
No, no, not like that.
O-Okay.
What, why Louise?
T-That snobby son of a...
Don't get so close to her!
What?!
Show me what you've got.
But I'm not a student at this school...
If the enemy were to come right now, would you not be fighting as well?
I can only use practical weapons well...
You can also defeat an enemy with a wooden sword.
Wait! Give me a sec!
Stop running away!
Boring fight.
Saito!
Saito.
Hey!
What do you think you're doing to my familiar?
Miss Valliere.
I saw him fight the other day, but...
That's because he was holding Delflinger.
Delflinger?
My... sword.
Without a real sword or a practical weapon,
I can't use my skill as a familiar.
Oh, so your skill wasn't sharpened as a swordsman.
That's interesting.
Saito-kun.
May I ask you to fight with me?
You can use your Delf... whatever.
Why do I have to fight against you?
I am merely curious.
Curious?
I know.
What if the winner of the fight gets to kiss Louise?
What?
Wait, kiss? Stop making stuff up!
Aren't you a flamen?
Truth be told, in order to come to Tristain, I have temporarily returned to secular life,
so I am allowed to wield a sword as well.
Not to mention relations.
Back off! Don't touch Louise!
Saito.
I don't care if you're a flamen or whatever.
You're so snobby it bothers me.
If you want to fight or whatever, you got it.
Hey, hold on.
No, I'm doing it.
What are you getting all worked up for?
If you get serious, he'll die.
What? You're worried about him and not me?
That's not what I meant.
Now isn't the time to be creating trivial problems.
If you insist on fighting, use the wooden sword.
I won't allow you to use a real sword.
Fine.
We'll fight tomorrow morning using wooden swords.
Saito!
I am looking forward to it.
What do you want, calling me out here?
If it's a ridiculous request...
Please! Teach me how to fight with swords.
I've... never seriously learnt swordsmanship.
If it's a real weapon, I can use it the moment it's in my hands.
When I hold a sword, my body moves on its own.
It's the power of Gandalfr, the legendary familiar.
Gandalfr?
However...
I don't think that I should rely solely on that power.
If I were suddenly attacked like how the vice-captain did...
that'd be the end of me.
With this war... there could be lots of danger ahead.
So, I can't protect Louise unless I become strong.
Louise?
So, you want me to teach you swordsmanship for the sake of protecting Miss Valliere?
Of course, I want to win tomorrow's fight, too.
I just can't bring myself to like that guy.
I don't like flashy guys, either.
But Saito, can you keep up with my training?
Saito-san?
I haven't seen him.
Don't lie to me! He isn't in our room, either.
You're hiding him, aren't you?
Where is he? Where did you hide him?
Don't tell me...
I am not hiding him!
Stand! There is no time to rest.
Ow!
At least you have the form.
By experiencing real battle, you must have picked up the basics.
Y-Yeah?
But form alone will not help you win.
Strike at the opponent's opening!
Your familiar?
If you're looking for Saito, I saw him in the backyard.
He was with the captain of the Musketeer Force.
By Captain, do you mean Agnes?
They were breathing hard and drenched in sweat together.
W-What's that supposed to mean?
Damn it...
Strike at the opening, she says...
But, where do I even find an opening?
Come to think of it, you said that you don't like mages who use fire...
You got something against them?
K-Keep your mouth shut.
There's my chance!
Good. That's the way.
O-Okay.
So it was true...
Huh? Louise?
It's your fault.
Not at all...
You stupid dog!
No!
Dirty dog!
Pervert dog!
What's wrong?
You look as though you were beaten all night long by a dragon in a jealous rage.
Well... that's actually what happened.
I do not mind calling off the fight.
I don't intend to run away.
Shall we get started, then?
Louise, is that kiss ready?
You bastard!
Go, go!
Good luck!
Saito! Don't lose!
Oh, you're rooting for Saito?
It's because whoever wins gets to kiss Louise.
I see. You can't bear to see Julio-sama kiss Louise.
I understand.
Hey, my partner's doing pretty well.
Can he win?
Nope, he'll lose.
The opponent's too strong.
He's quite a master.
Saito.
Are you really a flamen?
Do you want to kiss Louise that much?
You said you returned to secular life,
but didn't you really get kicked out for being a womaniser?
Now!
A plan to aggravate me, then striking during the opening?
What an amateur trick.
Saito-kun, not only do I want to kiss Louise,
I want to kiss you, too.
An opening!
I lost.
Sir Julio!
Saito, you jerk!
You did it. Are you hurt at all?
Nothing more than the wounds you gave me.
What kind of response was that?
Anyway, my partner wins.
Let him kiss you.
Do it, partner!
A chance to do so with permission!
W-What are you saying?!
But...
I don't want it.
Hey! What do you mean by that?
You want... to.. kiss me, right?
That's why you beat Julio, right?
I didn't win.
He lost on purpose.
With partner's current skill, there was no chance of winning.
That bastard...
He's fooling around with me!
Even then, you didn't have to refuse me in front of everyone.
That looked as if I... I was rejected.
Code name Zero.
Emergency call.
Come in.
Good job. Step outside.
Julio!
You bastard! What was the meaning of that battle?
I am interested in neither win nor loss.
I just wanted to know the strength of my team-mate.
Team-mate?
Exactly.
He is your team-mate.
Are you...
Princess!
Louise. Saito-san.
Thank you very much for the other day.
No, it was nothing.
Sorry for my familiar's rudeness.
Absolutely not.
Thanks to you two, I was saved.
And I'm sure he was, too.
I heard what happened to Prince Wales as well.
It was Albion's conspiracy after all, was it not?
Princess! Why is he here?
Like I said, I am your team-mate.
What's that supposed to mean?
Romalia's pope senses danger from Albion as well,
so he sent me to lend my hand to the Princess.
Both he and I wish to avoid the war.
But the situation is profound.
Louise, Saito-san, Julio-san.
And Agnes.
You are those upon whom I rely.
Yes, Your Highness!
So, in other words, you concentrated your force to this school.
What? You have something to say about that?
No, I'm just bothered by what Colbert-sensei said.
The don't bring war onto the campus thing?
Saito-san.
I have no intention of subjecting the school to the dangers of war.
I honestly want to borrow your strength for the sake of peace.
Will you cooperate?
I will.
I hope we'll get along well, Louise.
Hey! Stay away from Louise!
Louise! What are you blushing for?
I-I'm not blushing!
You are.
You're bright red.
Bright, bright red.
What? You're a dog, and you dare make fun of your master?
Stop calling me a dog!
Dog!
Everyone, I must start with an unfortunate piece of news.
Tristain's Queen, Henrietta, on her day of coronation,
has executed our King, Lord Cromwell.
What?!
Unforgivable!
Furthermore, in thirst for more blood, Henrietta is increasing her military forces in order to invade our country!
Sheffield... She was Lord Cromwell's secretary...
Now she's acting like the new King rather than a magistrate.
It is now time to show the true power of Albion.
We shall repel all the enemies that come,
However, when she stands before us,
we cannot object against her authority.
and execute the detestable Henrietta with our hands!
Who is she exactly?
Magistrate Sheffield!
Hurray!
Hurray!
Hurray!
You dog!
If you do anything to Eleonore-oneesama or Cattleya-neesama, you won't stay alive.
Zero no Tsukaima. Futatsuki no Kishi.
The Valliere Sisters.
If you want to meet me again next week, then sit tightly and wait!
