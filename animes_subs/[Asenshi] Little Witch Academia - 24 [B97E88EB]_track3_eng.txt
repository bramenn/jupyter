Are they red-hot anger? Deep blue sadness?
Or perhaps pitch black despair.
Sturcadeus.
As long as I keep my emotions under control, you can't absorb them for your Fuel Spirit.
I always admired your magic.
But you no longer believe in it.
Oh, but I do.
And I will make it stronger, through the power of science!
And I will make it stronger through the power of science.
That is the true future of magic.
Do you really think things will go as you wish?
It seems we must make it clear, once and for all, which of us is right.
It seems we must make it clear which of us is right once and for all.
As I thought, you were hit with the pollen.
What is this incredible energy?
We need to call in the military to get them under control!
It looks like they're going towards the Leyline.
It's strange.
I never expected so much energy to be collected. The folly of man knows no limits.
There was no need for me to activate itthe Noir Rod has started itself!
Unfortunately for you, magic can no longer be used in this location without a router.
Stop!
The Leyline!
You're pretty stubborn to follow me all the way here.
You are right. This is where the Grand Triskelion is sealed.
As you said, the Grand Triskelion is sealed here.
It won't be long until I release it.
This is where we are?
It's here?
Man, this place is giving me the creeps. Let's get the hell outta here.
This place is giving me the creeps. Let's get the hell out of here.
The Leyline was messed up too. Something's definitely wrong.
Look at that!
What is it?
Attention all citizens taking part in the riot!
We order you to disperse immediately!
Failure to comply results in
If you fail to do so...
A coup d'etat?!
It's currently only a rumor.
However, several videos of the riots are being uploaded online, so I consider a coup d'etat possible.
Unbelievable. Have they no sense?
Gather more detailed information.
A coup d'etat, huh...
Use... how so?
Use howso?
But faced with a coup d'etat, those pacifists will have no choice but to wake up.
If the situation demands, we could even deploy the military.
You intend to take advantage of another country's crisis?!
Go and gather more information.

Where is t?!
That's a lie!
It is the truth.
Why do you always overlook me?
If you'll never choose me...
Then stop showing me your face!
What?
Run, Chariot...
You've done enough!
No, I haven't!
I stole your dream!
I stole Akko's power!
And that's why I won't let even more things get stolen!
The Words!
Cast the spell!
Noctu Orfei!
Aude!
I made up my mind to return it to Chariot once I found her.
Please accept it.
It was so pretty and fun and cool, and it felt like I was in a dream.
I can't even describe how it made me feel!
I was touched in ways I can't describe.
I believed that if I became a witch, I'd be able to see Chariot again.
That was my dream.
I caused them so much trouble and they still helped me so much, and that's what brought me so far.
I caused them lots of trouble and was always getting helped, and that brought me here.
I wanted to be like Chariot, gracefully flying through the sky and using beautiful transformation magic.
Professor, I keep working even harder!
I'll work hard to become a witch who can make everyone smile.
So please keep on teaching me how to use magic, just like you always have!
So just like you always have, please keep on teaching me how to use magic!
Of course I'm fine with you.
Thank you, Professor.
I love you.
Akko.
You made my dream come true.
Dreams grow through your connections with others.
Isn't that just some stick?

I swear I will stop you.
Oh? I wonder about that.
Now, let your emotions show.
Will they be red-hot anger? Deep-blue sadness?
Or perhaps pitch-black despair.
Sturcadasse.
It's futile to try and steal my magic.
As long as I keep my emotions under control, you can't absorb them with your Fuel Spirit.
I'm not surprised.
Your talent for magic is the real thing.
I always admired your magic.
But you no longer believe in it.
Oh, but I do!
And I will make it stronger through the power of science!
That is the true future of magic.
Do you really think things will work out as you plan?
It seems we must make it clear which of us is right, once and for all.
As I thought, you did get hit by the pollen.
You have no chance of victory if you can't fly!
You think your little tricks will work on me?!
Bye bye, Prof.
Professor Croix, would you care to explain what this is?
We are not giving you a choice.
Headmistress!
What... is this incredible energy?
What's going on?
We need to call in the military to get them under control!
What's happening?
Looks like they're heading towards the leyline.
This is strange.
Let's return to Luna Nova.
Okay.
I never even imagined that I would collect so much energy. The folly of man knows no limits.
I did not even have to activate it the Noir Rod has started itself!
What did you say?!
What?
Cease and desist!
My magic...
Ouch!
Hey!
Ow...
Why?!
Unfortunately for you, magic is now unavailable to anyone without a router in this location.
Croix!
Don't!
What now?!
The leyline!
It's disappearing?
It can't be...
Now, to Arcturus Forest!
I've finally made it here.
The Nine Olde Witches' seal...
You're pretty stubborn, following me all the way here.
You're right. This is where the Grand Triskelion is sealed.
And it won't be much longer before I release it.
Just watch me as I finish the job you were unable to complete.
Ouch...
Isn't this...
Arcturus Forest?!
This place is?
Man, this place is giving me the creeps. Let's get the hell outta dodge.
Tia Freyre!
Huh?
It appears that our magic power has been drained.
The leyline was messed up too. Something's definitely wrong.
Look, there!
What is that?
I suspect it's related to these occurrings.
Let's go!
And now to break the seal.
It's this?
Attention, all citizens involved in the riot!
You are to disperse immediately!
Failure to comply will result in
A coup d'etat?!
At this point, it's only a rumor.
However, going by the videos of the riots that have been put online, a coup d'etat is a real possibility.
Unbelievable. Do the people in that country have no sense at all?
Gather more detailed intelligence.
A coup d'etat, huh...
We may be able to use this.
Use how so?
Our moderates are far too soft on that nation.
But faced with a coup d'etat, those pacifists will have no choice but to open their eyes.
Deploying the military might be imperative.
You intend to exploit another country's crisis?!
Andrew!
Go and gather more intelligence.
Change the world!

No!
This is all wrong!
This can't be true!
There's no way this is the world reconstruction magic!
It's wrong!
There's no way... this is the Grand Triskelion...
This banal...
Croix...
Professor Woodward!
Where is the Grand Triskelion?
Where is it?!
You already hold it in your hands.
That's a lie!
It is the truth.
Then why isn't anything happening?!
What part of this do you call world reconstruction magic?!
Why do you always look right past me?
Why won't you guide me?
If you'll never choose me...
Then stop showing me your face!
Go away!
Croix!
Red. Red. Red. Red.
R-R-R-RRR
Stop!
Stop...
Stop it!
Turn off the machine!
I can't... it's not stopping!
Even you betray me in the end?!
Wh-What was that?
Wh-What...
Stop!
Croix!
Chariot!
Chariot!
Why?!
It's after me.
Just leave me and go!
No!
I'll never abandon you!
We'll both be
I won't let you get Croix!
Chariot...
Run, Chariot...
You've done enough!
No, I haven't!
I stole your dream!
I stole Akko's power!
That's why I won't let anything more be stolen!
Chariot...
Chariot!
Murowa!
Professor!
Akko!
You're kidding...
This one looks pretty dangerous.
What now? We're all still in danger.
I see. Its energy link is starting to break.
That means...
This is it!
Croix!
Professor!
The Words!
Cast the spell!
Noctu Orfei!
Noctu... Orfei!

Aude!

You got it... you did it, Akko!
Akko...
Chariot...
We finally meet!
Take it.
But...
This isn't mine.
I made up my mind to return it to Chariot once I found her.
Please accept it!
I saw one of your Chariot shows when I was a child.
It was so pretty and fun and cool, and it felt like I was in a dream!
I can't even describe how moved I was!
That was when I decided to become a witch.
I believed that if I became a witch, I'd be able to see Chariot again.
That was my dream!
And now I've met you.
My dream... came true.
Akko...
But this only happened thanks to everyone.
We met at school, got to know each other, and became friends.
I caused them lots of trouble and was always getting helped, and that's what brought me here.
Without them, I never would've made it.
It's thanks to them, and... and also...
Thanks to you.
Professor, it still doesn't feel real that you're actually Chariot.
Because to me, you're my teacher.
And so...
Would you please keep being my Professor Ursula?
Akko...
I was the one who took your
Professor!
I understand now.
I'll never be Chariot.
I wanted to be like Chariot, gracefully soaring through the sky and using beautiful transformation magic.
But Chariot is Chariot, and I'm me.
I can only be myself.
Even if I can't fly and always mess up.
Akko...
Professor, I'll keep working even harder!
I'll work hard to become a witch who can make everyone smile.
Because to me, magic is the most wonderful thing in the entire world!
So please keep on teaching me how to use magic, just like you always have!
Are you sure you're fine with me?
I wouldn't want anybody else.
Thank you, Professor.
I love you.
Akko.
You made my dream come true.
That's...
Akko.
Put your feelings into words.
They will surely be the final Word.
Change the world.
Connect with other people, and your dreams will grow.
