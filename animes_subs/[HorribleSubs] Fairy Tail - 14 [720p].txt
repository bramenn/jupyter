Hey all you viewers out there!
When you're watching Fairy Tail keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen, all right?
Previously on Fairy Tail...
Lyon is planning to resurrect Deliora, and his lackeys came to attack the village!
But I beat them!
You did?
Now Lucy's fighting with the powerful enemy Sherry, but she's having a really tough time since I'm not there!
They say that's also love!
That's not even close to a recap...
A forced gate closure? So you are a Fairy Tail wizard...
The battle starts now!
But don't forget that I can control any of your spirits at will.
Let's just see about that.
I've got lots more powerful spirits where that came from!
Gate of Canis Minor, I open thee!
Nicolas!
Oh my, how cute...
That is also love.
What the heck does that even mean?!
Let me show you.
Doll Attack! Doll Control!
Evil
Plue?
It's not possible!
Do What You Must!!
What the...
You fell for it!
Damn, it was a small-fry spirit!
That's right!
I purposefully called out a weak spirit, so your technique is useless now!
Release Control!
Don't worry about it. Go back now, okay?
Doll Attack, Rock Doll!
We're just going around in circles, aren't we?
My spirits destroy your dolls, then you take them over, and I close the gate!
Oh, that's strange...
Could that also be love?
Going around in circles? Destroy... this?
These rocks?
Wait just a second...
Do I have a spirit that could destroy something this big?
This is bad, bad, bad, bad!
Don't let her escape, Rock Doll!
Catch that little girl!
Who're you callin' a little girl?
I look just as old as you do!
Now, now, if you keep blabbing we'll catch up to you!
Um, which spirit could I use?
A spirit I could use...
Hey now, if you don't watch where you're going we'll catch up to you!
There! Stomp her flat!
Hey, wait... This's...
A cliff!!
After her, Rock Doll!
That way's a dead-end.
The sea... I could call Aquarius here, but...
You have nowhere left to run!
Water can't destroy rock...
And Aquarius would just sweep me away, too...
Sweep me away?
Now, it's time for you to be flattened!
That's also love!
Sweep away... That's it!
Gate of the Water Bearer, I open thee!
Aquarius!
Aquarius?!
You have such a powerful spirit?
The enemy is that woman!
You hate women like her, right?
Get her!
I see your bad attitude hasn't changed, has it?
Stop complaining and do it!
I see you're still annoying.
That's why you can't get a boyfriend.
Give it a rest!
Doll Attack! Doll Control!
Now Aquarius will do as I say.
Go right ahead and send her back.
No! She's my trump card!
Then I can crush you under the power of the sea, yes?
Aquarius, erase that woman from my sight!
I was planning on doing it anyway!
What an idiot...
Hey, wait...
Who needs forced closure anyway? I'll close the gate myself, thanks... Idiots.
Aquarius will sweep away enemy and ally alike with her waves.
I was careless...
But she wasn't able to defeat the Rock Doll, was she?
So what?
Controlled Doll's movements follow the orders of the person controlling them,
so there's no need to defeat the Rock Doll.
All I needed to do is get you all dizzy and...
This is the skill of a Fairy Tail wizard!
Playing me to a draw, are we?
A draw? This is my victory!
What are you talking about?
You're just as dizzy as...
Then, how about some of this?
How about that?
I'm a Fairy Tail wizard too you know!
Even if the flame of my life were to be snuffed out...
There is no untruth to my love for Reitei-sama.
You're not gonna die, drama queen.
Angelica... Avenge me...
Wait! That thing wasn't a Doll?
Oh no! I can't move my legs...
Aw, crap...
Erza!
Oh yeah... We broke the guild rules and went on an S class quest without permission...
Lucy, you know why I'm here, don't you?
To take us back...
Lucy!
Thank goodness!
You're sa-
Where is Natsu?
Please, listen!
We apologize for going without permission, but this island is in real trouble!
There are guys who are trying to resurrect a demon trapped in ice,
and the people of the village are suffering thanks to that spell.
Anyway, it's a big problem!
We want to save this island somehow...
I do not care.
T-Then at least let us finish the job!
You're mistaken, Lucy.
You have betrayed the master.
Do not think you will get away from this unscathed.
She's scary!
Where am I?
Thank goodness! You're awake.
Where is this?
This is a storage area a bit removed from the village.
The village was destroyed last night, so everyone took refuge here.
The village is gone?
Destroy the village.
Yes, sir!
Lyon, you bastard... You actually went and did it?
But thanks to Ms. Lucy and Mr. Natsu, no one was injured, so we have to at least be glad for that.
Are they also here?
Yes.
They asked us to direct you to their tent when you woke up.
I see.
They're waiting in that big tent.
You're late, Gray.
Erza?!
Lucy, Happy?
I've heard what happened from Lucy.
Weren't you supposed to be stopping Natsu?
I'm speechless.
Where's Natsu?
That's what I'd like to know.
He should have been in the village fighting Reitei's lackeys,
but when we went to check, there was no one there.
I figured that Natsu would be okay, and Erza told me to take her to where you were, Gray.
I searched from the air, and that's how we found this storage area.
Gray, we're going in search of Natsu.
When we find him, we're returning to the guild.
What are you saying, Erza?
If you heard what's going on, then you've got to know what's happening on this island!
And what of it?
Shoot...
I finally had a good idea, and then I overslept.
Anyway, let's start!
I came here to bring back some guild rule-breakers.
I have not a sliver of interest in anything else.
Didn't you see what the people on this island look like?
I saw.
And you're just going to leave them like that?
The request has been posted to every guild.
Would it not be better to leave it to some guild wizards that take on the job properly?
I misjudged you, Erza!
What did you say?
How dare you say that to the great Erza!
The great?
You intend to break the guild rules as well?
You won't get away with it.
Do what you must!
This is the path I've chosen.
It's something I've got to do.
I'm going to finish this.
If you're going to cut me down, do it.
Hey, Erza, calm down!
Gray's just angry'cause he lost to his old friend!
The present situation is unacceptable.
So we'll continue this after the present problem is solved.
Erza!
Don't get the wrong idea.
You will be punished.
Aye...
How pitiful.
You're the only one left, Toby?
Damn you, Fairy Tail... Not bad.
Please keep me fragging myself a secret, okay?
Deliora's resurrection may be in danger at this rate.
So you're here, Zalty...
Deliora will be resurrected when we pour in the full magical power of the moon tonight.
However if the Moon Drip ceremony is interrupted,
Deliora will stay in that ice forever...
And what's more, Titania has joined the enemy forces.
Your intelligence is fast, as always.
But I cannot be defeated.
Nothing defeats the ice sword that surpasses even Ul's...
That is quite heartening to hear, yes...
Then, it's been a while, but perhaps I should join in the battle myself...
Wait, you used to be able to fight?!
Yes. I know a bit of Lost Magic, you see...
What an ominous fellow.
An earthquake?!
This is...
The ruins are collapsing!
What the heck is this?
He didn't waste any time...
Look, he's down below.
I'd rather destroy it before you found me out,
but these ruins are a lot harder to bring down than I thought.
What are you trying to do?
Tip the building over!
Then the moonlight can't land on the demon in the basement!
You bastard! How dare you?
Curse you, Fairy Tail!
I dunno... I don't get what's going on at all...
He is trying to tilt these ruins.
By destroying half of the pillars holding up the base of the ruins,
he can tilt the building so that the light of the moon will not hit Deliora.
That's his plan, I believe.
He may not look it, but he's quite shrewd.
Enough blabbing!
Flames on his legs?
He can produce flames from all over his body!
Huh? A fake?
Ice Make Eagle!
You can't avoid them from the air!
What random magic...
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
It seems you were in luck, Reitei-sama.
Just keep the fact that I got hit to yourself...
What did you do?
What indeed?
Don't dodge the question.
It was your magic that destroyed the floor!
Ah, Reitei-sama... Nothing gets past your eyes.
But, please understand.
I cannot afford to lose you until Deliora is resurrected.
You're saying I'd be beaten if I was hit by those flames?
Begone.
I will finish him myself.
I'm the one and only wizard who can defeat Deliora.
Reitei Lyon!
To even imply that I would have trouble with a brat like him is insulting.
Oh, my...
Defeat Deliora?
Defeat Deliora? That's his goal?
But it's, like, already half defeated, right?
So you want to break it free of the ice on purpose to fight it?
That's pretty whacked out there, buddy.
It's all to surpass Ul.
So I can continue to dream!
Then why don't you just challenge Ul directly?
You didn't hear? Ul's already dead!
The demon who Ul, the wizard who taught me magic, risked her life to seal away!
So she ended up dying?
That's right. And it was Gray's fault.
I don't know what happened in the past.
But what you're trying to do now is making a lot of people suffer.
I'm gonna make you open your eyes!
With my hot flames!
Lyon's aim has always been to surpass Ul.
Now with Ul gone, he wants to defeat Deliora, a foe that Ul couldn't kill, in order to surpass her.
I see. So that's the only way for him to surpass someone who's dead.
Aye.
No... He... Lyon doesn't know.
It's true that Ul is no longer with us.
But...
Ul is still... alive!
Professor Happy's Fairy Tail Lectures!
Today I'll be telling you the secrets of me, Happy!
I'm a wizard who uses Aera magic to grow wings and fly!
And even though I'm a cat, I can speak like humans.
Please don't question if I'm really a cat, okay?
By the way, I love to eat fish!
Until next time!
Stand, Bow, Aye!
Gray's teacher is the one that sealed Deliora, right?
Aye! She's the one who taught him Creation Magic.
If she was able to teach a dimwit like him magic, she must have been an incredible wizard!
I wonder what Gray was like before he joined the guild?
Next time: Eternal Magic
Gray before he came to Fairy Tail?
Aye! We'll find out why he strips all the time, too!
Uh... TMI.
