Naminanakai Public Hospital
Episode Fourteen: The Promised Day
Naminanakai Public Hospital
Oh, Chisaki-chan.
Must be hard, every day.
No... my school is nearby, so...
Kihara Isamu
There's some left over again.
He doesn't seem to have much of an appetite lately.
I see...
You should come here once you're done with nursing school.
It'd be a huge help, having someone as reliable as you here.
Right...
South 412 Yamaguchi Youhei Kihara Isamu Tanaka Masaru Kitagawa Kyosuke
Grandpa, you have to eat!
There's no flavor.
Once you're out of the hospital, you can eat whatever you want as much as you like.
All right, I'm going to wipe you down.
Sea Salt
Today's the Tomoebi.
Tomoebi...
We all have to be together.
Someone important's coming, huh?
Oh... Yes.
Apparently a professor from Tsumugu's lab.
There.
If he's from the city, he probably won't like country cooking.
Go buy some alcohol and meat with that.
Okay.
Oshiooshi Station Front
Hey, Chisaki.
Sayama-kun.
I'll give you a lift.
I was thinking about stopping by Saya Mart on my way home.
That's perfect, then.
Apparently Egawa's getting married.
What?!
He knocked a girl up.
K-Knoc
B-But what about college?
Apparently the girl's dad is the president of some company,
so he's going to quit school and work at her dad's company.
Talk about a surprise.
That's this year's biggest surprise.
He said he'd be back for the coming-of-age ceremony,
so we're all gonna tease him.
Everyone's changed so much...
and it's only been five years.
I think you've changed the most.
Huh?
I dunno...
There's a rumor going around like you're some lonely housewife.
It's oddly hot.
Wh-What?!
You're late, mister!
You were probably out playing pachinko again.
Just went out for a refresher.
The boss was waiting quite a while...
Oh, Chisaki!
Hello.
Here, Akira-kun. This is for you.
Where's your thank you?
Fanks...
Stop it, Akira!
He only listens to Miuna so I don't know what to do with him.
But...
It's all thanks to Miuna.
The people of the sea can hibernate, right?
Then Hikari-kun and the others are probably asleep, too.
Right. I'm sure they're okay.
So...
That's not it!
Akari?!
There's no way I can have the baby right now...
We've been blessed with a baby...
Don't say something so sad...
I'm sorry. Just leave me alone.
Akari...
Just go over there! Please.
M-Miuna?
Miuna...
It'll be a little brother.
You can tell?
A boy, huh...
I'm happy.
I'm happy...
I'm happy that I'll have a younger brother.
Thank you, Mom.
Akari-san?
Oh, i-it's nothing.
Kancho.
Hey, Akira!
I'm so sorry...
He's so obsessed with that lately...
I-It's okay...
Jeez... you dummy!
Come back here!
Oh? Did you get one of your special kancho attacks in?
I said, wait! Hey!
Run! Run!
Miuna...
Mi-u-na.
Well done, Sayu.
Good morning, Miss Miuna.
Good morning, Teacher.
You look a lot like your uncle.
Huh?
Your sleeping face.
Hikari used to sleep a lot, too.
Oh...
Now, today's the day of the exciting Tomoebi.
Before, you couldn't see it unless you were at the bottom of the sea.
And, now it's the moon rather than the sun.
Tomoebi
Because the sea is frozen, the ice acts like a prism,
and gathers the light from the saltflake snow.
That creates an image in the atmosphere,
Tomoebi Before Only visible from inside the sea
Temperature Water Temperature Tidal Current
Sun
Calm Sea Surface
Tidal Current
and makes an illusory moon.
When the moon is low in the sky, let's see...
I'd say 8 o'clock is probably the best viewing time.
Sensei, before that...
Oh? Oh, right. Dinner.
After this, it's time to get ready for the rice feeding.
Having a rice feeding by the sea with everyone...
Hello, everyone...
It's sort of nostalgic, isn't it?
The main event is the Tomoebi.
Don't forget that.
Yeah...
Having class at night is exciting.
Right, Minegishi?
Oh, right.
Be on your guard, Miuna.
For what?
I totally found out...
When the Tomoebi happens
Minegishi's planning to ask you out.
Ask me out...
Everyone's so lame!
School's a place for studying!
Sayu, you used to hate studying.
I've decided that I'm going to be a girl living on her own.
It's not like I'm going to find work in Oshiooshi...
So I'm going to go out into the city and become an independent woman.
You've thought out your future that far?
Well, yeah. What about you, Miuna?
I'm not sure yet...
But I don't plan on leaving.
Oh...
Miuna.
Huh?
Your hair's gotten longer.
Yeah.
Sayu, Miuna.
The teacher's calling for you.
Oh, thanks.
Hurry up, Miuna!
Yeah.
Don't you guys have to be in school?
I always watched from here...
Just like this.
Akari!
Akari-san!
Mukaido!
Look! The bridge pier!
No!
At that moment, I decided I wouldn't cry.
Because I knew that Hikari and the others were in the sea.
I believed that they were safe.
Hikari and the others are still somewhere I can't go, smiling.
I'm home.
Oh! Smells good!
Sorry I'm late.
I'll help, too.
It's okay. It's my turn today.
You're a little wet.
I went to look at the sea again for a little bit.
But something's in the way so it's no use.
The sea temperature's gone down, too...
Is your tummy okay?
It's fine!
We'd always gotten pregnant and raised our young in the sea.
Well, it's not all bad.
Huh?
He's not alone... Dad's there, too.
And Hikari liked Manaka...
If Manaka and the others had been left in the sea, and he was alone,
I don't think Hikari would know what to do...
Hikari... likes Manaka...
Oh, Miuna. It'll spill over.
Safe.
He likes Manaka...
Miuna.
What's wrong?
Sorry! I'm coming!
Even now, I look out from here...
To the sea where Hikari and the others are.
Professor! Tsumugu!
Why not warm up a little before the Tomoebi?
Delicious!
The stewed golden-eye is delicious.
You can't get food like this in the city.
Is that so?
Huh?
N-Nothing. As long as you like it.
The meat is good.
Sorry to barge in like this.
Not at all.
It's lively, and I'm glad.
Because Tsumugu came to our lab,
our research has progressed quite a bit.
There are only fourteen sea villages in Japan.
Not to mention, we can't step foot into any of them right now.
Even when we try diving to investigate,
the tide gets in our way and we can't get close to the location.
There are even specialists now saying that the sea villages don't exist anymore.
They're just saying that to get attention.
Hiradaira-san,
I believe that there is a close relationship between the surface and the sea.
To explain the abnormal weather,
we need to research the sea villages as well.
I see...
Oh, I'll bring you another.
Well, thank you.
She's a great girl.
Are you sure there's nothing going on?
Of course not.
You guys are at that age and you're living under one roof.
Not to mention, she's beautiful...
that'd usually mean...
She has someone else that she's liked for a long time.
Huh?
There...
He can take care of the futon himself.
He's a guest.
That wouldn't be right.
Won't you come see the Tomoebi, too?
I'll pass.
There's no point in seeing the Tomoebi without the others.
I see...
Do you want me to make some amazake since it's cold?
Yeah, sounds good.
What are we gonna do?
It really did turn into a huge deal.
Did we find the sea kids that fell in yet?
This is the first time something like this ever happened.
To think that the Sea God was this angry...
What are we going to do about her?
She doesn't have any relatives on the surface...
Chisaki-chan...
You can come live with us.
B-But...
You've already got a full house in your apartment.
And...
I'm from the sea, as well.
Grandpa, the lady next door wanted to give this to you...
Grandp
Grandpa!
Please, wake up! Grandpa!
In Surgery
If you're a family member, please wait over here.
No! Don't take Grandpa away!
Chisaki, calm down.
Don't leave me...
Don't take anyone else away from me!
Chisaki.
Chisaki.
Um... Did you pack your underwear?
Don't worry about it, I'll do it myself.
No way. You're not all there when it comes to stuff like this.
So you're gonna be a college student in the big city...
Oceanography researcher is really amazing.
You should be proud!
Sorry that you somehow ended up taking care of Gramps.
Well, this is my other family.
My precious...
Family, huh...
I'm going to do research in college.
About the sea villages,
about what happened that day...
I'm sure they're tied into what's going to happen on the surface.
Tsumugu...
I'm sure they're fine.
If everything takes a turn for the better,
I'm sure we'll see them again.
Yeah.
So good!
What the hell? Mine is all potatoes!
Let's hurry up and eat.
The Tomoebi is about to start.
Minegishi, what about Shiodome?
Huh? Uh...
Come on.
Today's the day you prove you're a man.
Seriously, boys are so stupid.
Your tray. I'll go put it away.
Oh, right...
The currents...
It's about to start.
Yes, it is.
Since that day, the sea has been calm.
Quietly... Quietly...
Not telling me what's happening below.
Shiodome!
Um...
Are you... asking me out?
Huh?! Wh-Wha...
I'm sorry, I was being overly self-conscious.
If I'm wrong, don't worry about it.
You're not wrong!
Then let me say this first.
I'm in love with someone else.
Huh?
So... I'm sorry.
I can't!
I've always liked you! Ever since grade school!
I can't just give up...
I can't... just give up.
I can't give up!
Who is this guy you like?
Tell me!
Well...
Shiodome!
This is the Tomoebi...
It's quite magnificent, isn't it?
Hey, what is that?
Something big is showing up on screen...
Is it a fish?
H-Hey, what's wrong?
Miuna, you...
Hikari!
He hasn't changed at all from back then... not at all.
He's not breathing!
Um, I don't think doing mouth-to-mouth on a person from the sea will...
H-Hika
Manaka!
Who... are you?
She's Miuna.
Huh? Miuna?
Tsumugu?
Hikari's eyes...
had stopped moving in sadness.
Like the lull of the sea.
The reason Hikari came back...
You look like you've seen a monster.
Talk about a turn of events.
I changed from back then?
Hikari... came back.
