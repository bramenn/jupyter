Wow, the rumors weren't wrong.
The Chinese Cuisine RS packs quite a punch.
How about some black pepper buns?
Totsuki Culinary Teahouse Academy Famous Taiwanese Black Pepper Buns
We also have sorta-danzi noodles!
Yuki-chan, Ryoko-chan!
What's going on?
What about the taro stew booth?
We're taking turns going on break.
More importantly, are you guys turning a profit?!
Um, our sales improved thanks to our new sorta-danzi noodles on the item,
but we still have a lot to make up for from the first day.

Seriously?
Yukihira-chin...
Oh, Kuga-senpai.
Would you like a black pepper bun?
Nope!
I hear you've been scurrying around at night.
You've broadened your offerings, too,
but this is day three, you know?
It's not exactly pleasant to have you in front of my establishment
with your poor sales performance.
Why won't you close up shop for us, say, right now?
Close up, close up, close up!
I'll never forget that you were here, so!
Let's close up, stat, yeah?
Just do it, okay?
Just go. Leave now!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Close up, close up!
What the hell? What an asshole.
Wow, what's this line for? Whose booth is it?
It's Sichuan cuisine!
Want to try it?
Oh?
Here, here!
Sorry, please go to the end of the line!
Kuga Restaurant is eager to serve you!
Why'd Yukihira pick such a hopeless battle?
He's too reckless.
It's nothing new, but...
You know, Soma-kun was saying something yesterday.
About Chinese Cuisine RS...
Do you think their booth's getting everything right from A to Z as a restaurant?
So, yeah.
Huh? But...
They're doing so well, though.
Yes, but...
Soma-kun hasn't given up yet.

Yeah. Thanks, Tomita-san!
Okay, he's going to get it for us.
I also really want lots of what we talked about around our booth,
but I'm not sure I have anyone I can hit up for that.
I might be able to help with that.
Just focus on recipe testing, Soma-kun.
Okay.
Oh, captain, hello?
Um, I have a favor to ask...
It's done...
Soma-kun, this is amazing!
With this on the menu...
Yup, let's roll.
Tomorrow's Saturday, so there will be even more visitors than before.
It'll be a bull's-eye.
Moon Festival Day 4
Kuga Restaurant
Good morning, all!
Our Chinese Cuisine RS scored yet another victory in top sales in the Central Area!
I only have high praise for you all!
Let's keep up the same pace today!
Yes, sir!
Only two more days left, Tsukasa-san.
I am the monster Xiao Long Bao Man!

I am the monster Ground Chicken Skewer Man!
I am the monster Fresh Assorted Sashimi Platter Man!
We're the Totsuki Squad, Gastron!
You evil food monsters shall perish!
Gastron! Good luck!
Wow!
It's the legendary cooking manga, Knife-kun Ajiro!
It's a complete first printing set!
That's super rare!
It smells so good!
I can't stand it!
So good.
Wow!
One, please.
Me, too!
Piping hot!
It's so fragrant.
So good!
So spicy!
Spicy!
But so good!
Hup! Hup! Hup!
Um, Captain Kuga!
Look...
Huh?
Wow...
Yeah!
Hey, thanks for this, Tomita-san!
I can't say no to you, Soma-chan.
Besides, they were just gathering dust in the shopping district's warehouse.
Still...
That other place is so out of this world.
Are you sure these benches will work?
Yeah, I'm super grateful for them.
Oh, Tomita-san, please have a bite before you go as a sign of our thanks.
Oh, really?
I haven't had your food in a while.
I can enjoy Yukihira Diner's taste again.
You're not very smart, are you, Yukihira-chin?
This is what you finally came up with after wracking your brains?
You think you can just up your customer numbers by increasing seat numbers?
That's pretty simplistic, isn't it,
even if you know you can never beat my flavors?
It's true that this is my first Moon Festival,
and I'm a newcomer to the scene who only transferred here six months ago.
But as far as my experience in the service industry with actual restaurants goes...
I've got about ten years on you, Senpai.
Besides...
What?!
What's he making?!
It's mapo tofu!
He's going to face Kuga Terunori head-on with mapo tofu?!
Here, Soma-kun!
Thanks!
He's adding noodles to the mapo tofu.
I see. It's mapo noodles.
He's put a bit of a twist on it,
but that doesn't mean it's anything novel!
It's laughable that he's trying to go
up against Chinese Cuisine RS with so little impact!
What?!
What's that?!
What's with that giant meatball?!
Besides, I told you, didn't I?
I told you I'm going to win with my cooking.
Let's get back.
Meatballs are nothing unusual.
They're just for show!
Indeed!
That meatball...
Dig in, Tomita-san.
Thanks!
Huh?
Soma-chan, what's this?
Never mind that.
Please start by trying it without touching the meatball, if you can.
Hmm...
This is the Yukihira taste!
This is the mapo tofu I've eaten before!
The stable umami that almost makes you keep wanting to eat it every day!
The pairing with the noodles is spot-on, too!
Well done, Soma-chan!
But...
Thank you for waiting!
Here's Kuga Restaurant's Specially-Made Authentic Mapo Tofu!
So spicy!
Spicy!
I can't stop!
This is hardly enough to beat their far more dominating food.
That opponent has no weaknesses.
Is that really true, though?
Huh?
It's difficult for even a veteran professional with decades of experience
to completely please every single one of their customers.
How much longer?
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm hungry.
I wonder when I can get in.
Excuse me, sir.
During peak times,
we're asking everyone to leave their tables within 20 minutes of being served.
What?
But we just finished eating!
I really wanted to try authentic Sichuan cuisine, but the line is huge.
I'm hungry!
How much longer?
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm starving.
I can't wait anymore!
I want to eat!
I'm at my limit.
Hm...
I've been watching them all this time.
It just took me a while to realize what the drawbacks of Kuga Restaurant's set-up were.
Okay, Tomita-san.
Plunge that meatball right into the mapo tofu and split it open!
Huh?
O-Okay.
Plunge the meatball in...
Th... The moon...
The moon came out?!
And this fragrance... There's no mistaking it!
It's curry!
Curry, the dish that brings a smile to everyone's face!
What's that dish?!
Curry in mapo tofu?!
I've never eaten anything like that!
The moon's slowly melting and mingling with the mapo tofu!
Oh, nice.
Now's the best time to dig in.
Have at it!
What are these marvelous flavors?!
Herbs! Spices!
Sharp, yet gentle and mild!
The flavors gently wrap around you and sink into your very bones!
So this is the new Chinese cuisine Soma-chan has created!
With beef bone stock as the base,
I added select spices used in curries
along with garlic and ginger to create this special curry broth.
That's what the moon is.
I added gelatin to the curry broth to solidify it,
then wrapped it in pork filling from the black pepper buns before cooking it.
When the meatball eventually breaks,
the umami of curry spreads throughout the mapo dish!
This my second revised Yukihira dish!
Countdown Mapo Curry Noodles!
Hey, that kind of looks awesome!
Just smell that! I can't take it!
H-Hey...
Yeah!
Our line!
He took more than half of it!
Calm down.
There's no way that small stall can handle that much workload.
They'll implode in no time!
Please enjoy.
Those meatballs...
The ingredients and preparation method have been tweaked quite a bit,
but they're very similar to a hot pot served in Taiwan and one of China's regions
called Lion's Head Stew!
The dish likens the brawny meatball to the head of a lion.
I thought he was a weak housecat,
but in just two nights since his major defeat on day one...
He's become a ferocious lion!
But don't think you've won, Yukihira-chin.
We are legion, while you are only two.
There's no way you can win, is there?

One mapo curry noodles, please.
Can I have the danzi noodle dish?
You must be reaching your limit right about now, Yukihira-chin.
We're starting to fall behind in filling the orders!
It's about the time for him to show up.
Huh? What?
So I need more help on the day I'm gonna make a break for it.
I don't think you're doing a booth.
Can you help?
I'll need to train and visualize how this is supposed to work.
That'll help me speed things up.
It'll be best to give me access
to the same environment as my profiling target if at all possible.
Let me use your diner's kitchen.
That's just like you, Mimasaka. Sure.
Thanks.
Okay, here.
Thanks.

Never mind all that.
Just hurry up.
That guy was in the Autumn Elections' prelim semifinals!
It's Mimasaka Subaru!
Heh, not like adding one more pair of hands will do much.
Did you learn the recipe I gave you yesterday?
Don't underestimate my perfect profiling.
I'll show you the results of all the training I did until today.
Great!
All right, then!
Let's rip Kuga Restaurant a new one!
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!
Ten mapo curry noodles, please.
Got it!
Wow!
That rugged-looking boy is matching Soma-chan's speed perfectly!
Here you go!
Impossible!
It's as if there's another Yukihira Soma!
Delicious!
It smells so good!
There's curry inside!
This is good.
Man, you're a huge help.
I'm serious.
Thanks for agreeing to do this without a fuss.
I owe you a big one.
Huh? What'd you say?
Nothing.
We don't have time to chit-chat.
We're gonna get even more customers now!
The black pepper buns look good, too.

Mom, I want that!
Give me three.
Tadokoro, I'm counting on you!
Got it!
Please sit here while waiting.
Oh, thank you.
Would you prefer to use a spoon?
Oh, that'd be great.
Since you have a stroller, would you prefer to sit here?
Oh, thank you!
What steady customer service!
She's a formidable fighter in her own right!
Thanks, Miss!
Oh, that looks delicious.
Categorize the customers' needs
and wants by relative importance before acting on them.
Make sure you draw on everything you learned at the Stagiaire!
A'ight!
I have an idea!
Right, that's it!
What idea?
I need to make preparations!
Ryo-kun, come with me!
'Kay.
Hey, what the hell
Hayama-kun, make curry!
Something with great spices that would go with cacao!
Huh? Cacao?
Hey, Nakiri!
Hurry up, Ryo-kun.
'Kay.
It's about to get dark.
Yeah.
I think they'll come soon.
Tadokoro-kun!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Captain!
Let's get this all set up!
The Regional Cuisine RS's prized collection of lanterns from across the nation!
Yeah!
So pretty.
Amazing.
Hey, it kind of reminds me of that Jiufen place in Taiwan.
I kind of want to eat black pepper buns now!
Thank you! It's so bright and beautiful now.
It's so nice of you after I'd turned down Regional Cuisine RS's offer, too.
It's true that we were surprised you wouldn't be joining us,
but we knew you must've had a reason for that.
You're not the kind of person to turn away for no reason.
Captain...
Thank you!
Hey, what's with all those lanterns?
They're so pretty!
Let's check that place out!
What's that?
I smell something good.
Want to take a look?
Is a plum ticket good enough?
Yes.
Please wait a while longer for the black pepper buns.
One sorta-danzi noodles, please.
O-Okay, coming right up!
Five mapo noodles, please.
Three of those black pepper buns, please.
Two danzi noodles, please.
Okay. Please wait in line, sorry.
It's getting pretty hard to keep this going with just three people.
Yeah, but if we don't stand our ground now,
we'll never be able to catch up to Chinese Cuisine RS.
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you doing okay, Yukihira-chin?
Even if you get a ton of customers,
you won't be able to beat us if you can't up your throughput.
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!
Sorry, can you clear the table?
Oh, yes, coming!
Two mapo curry noodles, please!
When will the black pepper buns be ready?
S-Sorry, please wait a while longer!
Tadokoro's starting to crumble.
I'll have to handle the black pepper buns!
Mimasaka, hold it together for a sec!
Idiot!
If you step away from the burners,
you're gonna lose your shot at victory!
Let Megumi focus on customer service.
I'll handle the black pepper buns.
Mito-san!
Nikumi! But what about Don RS?!
I'm having the junior members handle it!
I had a hand in the creation of these black pepper buns, after all.
You don't need to teach me the recipe or anything.
When gauging whether the buns are done...
Don't miss the moment when the buns become slightly burnt.
That's the ideal cooking point, when the filling's juiciness begins to shine.
I can do this with my eyes shut.
Have some piping hot black pepper buns!
Thanks, Nikumi.
Thank you, Mito-san!
Whoa!
Here's the team who helped save our shopping district!
Bento Shop Tomitaya
Talk about a powerful and dependable reinforcement rushing in to join the battle!
You seem to be struggling, Yukihira.
I can't stand to watch.
I suppose that if you insist,
I wouldn't mind lending a hand!
Oh, I'll boil the noodles.
Awesome, thanks.
Hey, wait a minute, Isami!
Listen, Yukihira.
You challenged Kuga Terunori.
I won't allow you to lose without accomplishing anything!
This is the moment of truth, Takumi.
Can you keep up?
Why bother asking?
Aldini...
You easily managed to reach the speeds I only finally achieved
after my perfect profiling!
What's the matter, Mimasaka Subaru?
You're slow!
Shut up! I'm just getting started!
I'll beat you!
I wouldn't be so sure about that!
It's finally becoming a good restaurant.
I see...
That man... Yukihira Soma...
spent four days completing his restaurant.
We have one more hour until the day's sales are tallied.
This is our dash to the finish line!
Let's put our backs to it!
Yeah!
I'm touched by what I'm seeing.
You're tugging at my heartstrings!

You too, Aldini.
Thank you for eating!
Wow, so pretty!
Is that really chocolate on this curry?
That chocolate comes from this food 3D printer.
Wow! You printed food?!
Yes.
I added spices to chocolate with 80 percent cacao content
and used this machine to print it.
With this topping on the curry,
the gradually melting chocolate
adds flair to the curry flavors and transforms the dish!
The curry itself smells really good, too!
Dad! Please get me one!
Give me one!
I want to eat one for sure, too!
Two orders here!
Three, please!
The dish is proving popular to a broad range of customers...
This menu item has let us make a complete comeback.
Our ranking improved tremendously.
This should let us turn an overall profit.
Yes. But above all, I'm glad we made our customers happy.
Here you go.
Where's our order?
Yes, coming right up!
I'm sorry to make you wait!
Color me impressed.
Oh, a pine ticket?

I'm so glad you're making friends!
