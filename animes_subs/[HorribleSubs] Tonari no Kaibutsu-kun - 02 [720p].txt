Excuse me!
I'd like a Baby Star monja and a
cod roe mochi cheese and seafood monja!
Wow...
You're still hungry?
Shut up!
I need to eat my mind out!
My heart's still pounding...
Probably because I was so surprised.
That must be it.
I've never had anything this good before.
I guess everything tastes good when I'm with you.
The strange throbbing in my chest shows no sign of slowing.
I more or less know what's causing it...
A mixed monja with a double helping of pork!
Huh? You're still not done?
In any case,
I enjoyed my first experience with monjayaki,
so it wasn't all bad.
Weird
From a young age, my only concern was my grades.
I didn't care about anybody else or anything else.
My world began and ended with me.
1,300 yen for a box of potatoes...
To achieve a 30 margin,
each 700 gram bag
should be priced at 138 yen.
Oh?
What's going on here?
Something on your mind?
That's rare.
If my father knew how to calculate unit prices,
I wouldn't have to waste my time.
Keep it up!
Cucumbers 100 yen each
Something's wrong with me these days.
Half Price
I'm unable to concentrate on anything I do.
Samejima-san.
Could you stop putting new half-price stickers on these?
I certainly understand why that is...
Make-up exam?
Every student who failed a midterm
is required to take the make-up!
Since you forgot to put your name
and received a zero in every subject,
you have to take make-ups!
Are you taking make-ups?
As if.
I had the highest score in our grade.
Then I won't take them either.
Huh?
He would have
scored higher than me if he had put his name...
B-But, I saw him walking around in the rain on my way to school!
Don't you feel bad for him?
Right?
Tsk.
Come see Yoshida in 1-B if you want him as a pet. Pick on him and I'll kill you.
Whoa!
Oh, this is Yoshida's?
The students had gotten used to Haru's bizarre behavior by now,
but there was a small revolution going on inside me.
Why are you ignoring me?
I've been trying to get your attention.
I'm painfully conscious of his presence.
Can you blame me?
I've never been close to another human before.
How am I supposed to ignore him?
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?!
Don't pick on the rooster!
He doesn't seem to care.
Um...
What's going on?
I'm acting like...
Um...
Um...
Syoyo High School
This could be difficult.
Haru.
Hmm?
You said that y
You love me.
Yep. I love you, Shizuku.
In a romantic way?
I would totally do you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Anyway, can you take the rooster?
If you don't mind me deep frying him.
Mi
Mizutani-san!
Cleaners
Please help me study!
Tecchan Okonomiyaki Monja
My name is Natsume Asako.
Do you know who I am?
No?
We're in the same class.
By the way, Yoshida-kun keeps glaring at me...
With that rooster...
Just ignore him.
He's scared of you.
Oh, excuse me.
Can I get another pork and egg with cod roe mochi?
And I'd like the kimchi tempura and curry mix.
Sure.
You girls really like to eat.
So, as I was saying before, if I fail the make-up exams,
I'll have to take a remedial class next week.
However, I have an important
appointment with my friends that day,
so I can't fail the exam.
Mizutani-san, that's where
I refuse.
I've done what I can,
but...
I'm too stupid!
No kidding.
You answered every question and still failed.
Sorry, but that's your problem.
If you're so stupid, you should take the remedial class.
Er, um...
There you go then.
W-Wait!
Please wait, Mizutani-san!
Tecchan Okonomiyaki Monja
I beg you!
Oh, it stopped raining.
I don't have time
to take a remedial class!
Sorry about that.
I had too much to eat.
You were forcing yourself to eat all of that?
If I were a light eater, too many boys would fall for me.
I'm sure you've noticed how cute I am.
Boys always flock to me.
That's why I'm always shunned by girls.
W-Wait for me!
That spot is dry.
Please look at this.
High School Community
The appointment I mentioned earlier
was an offline gathering for the members
of an online community that I belong to.
The members are all strangers,
but they're the first friends I've ever made.
That's why you don't want to take the remedial class?
Yes.
I still refuse.
Evil!
This is what you get for being a slacker.
Give up.
Mercy, please!
Hey.
I can help you study.
R-Really?!
Yeah, I got you covered.
In return, take me with you.
Okay! Okay!
Will I be able to make friends at this offline gathering?
You bet! You bet!
Oh, but please don't fall in love with me.
It'd be a hassle.
Yeah, not a problem.
That's never happening.
Math I
Let's start with math.
Thank you very much!
Why are they doing this here?
Okay, watch closely.
Yes!
You do this...
I don't understand!
Okay, memorize that.
And for Japanese, English, and history, read the textbook.
All done.
Well, at least I'm not alone with Haru...
Idiot.
You make the x squared an x.
Yes...
No, how did you get 5, stupid?
Yes...
Here, look closely.
Not at me.
Oh, yes!
You do this...
Hmm? What was that?
You don't get any.
Have you seen that girl around?
Y-You mean Natsume-san?
No...
Damn, where'd she go?
Oh, there it is again.
I feel so agitated.
Nagoya, want some cabbage?
H-Ho
How's the studying going?
I-It's too late to trade places now!
I'm the one going to the offline event!
Not my point.
Is it really such a big deal?
You and Natsume-san are so odd.
Does it really matter that people don't like you?
You're really special, Shizuku.
What was that look about?
Have you ever felt empty inside?
Huh?
So empty...
you can't feel a thing.
Surrounded by darkness.
It really scares me.
But I'm not scared anymore...
because I have you.
As Haru spoke,
it almost seemed that he couldn't see anything at all,
even though I was right there...
Listen up. Black holes are...
What's that?
Please help me study.
There's definitely something wrong with me.
I never would have thought about these things before.
I didn't care what other people thought about me.
I need to study.
Final exams are coming up.
Tests, tests, tests...
There's so much background noise that I can't concentrate.
Man, it's hot...
The upperclassmen aren't being fair.
I know.
Mizutani-san.
Who are you?
What?
You should try to remember the faces of your classmates.
I'm Sasahara.
You can call me Sasayan.
Oh...
So, did you need something?
Not really.
I'm interested in you.
Why?
Because I like you.
You're lying.
You can tell?
You've been hanging out with Yoshida,
so I was wondering what you were like.
So, how did you get that truant to come to school?
Beats me.
I have no idea what he's thinking.
I'm guessing he just wanted a friend. Didn't matter who.
I went to the same middle school as Yoshida.
Did you know?
He basically went three years without coming to class.
What?
Well, anything's possible with Haru...
My point is,
the who must have mattered.
Sasayan, we're heading back!
Okay!
See ya, Mizutani-san.
Sasayan-kun!
I have a favor to ask.
Um...
What are you doing, Natsume-san?
Please don't mind me.
I'm in despair right now.
Yoshida-kun!
Shut up!
You're not supposed to bring roosters to school!
You're such a pain!
Hold it right there, Yoshida-kun!
It's all over...
I didn't understand anything that he taught me,
and there's no time left...
Well, students are supposed to spend their time studying.
Hmph! Who cares about school?!
The real me lives on the Internet!
On the Internet,
I'm constantly surrounded by friends.
Everyone comes to me for help.
I'm just an ordinary girl with hair problems.
Wouldn't that be considered
living a lie?
Just leave me alone.
Someone who's smart and unfeeling would never understand.
I-I'm not...
I don't care if I'm living a lie.
I want to be close to other people.
It's lonely when everyone keeps their distance.
Here, here, and here.
If you focus on these sections, you should pass.
There's a certain pattern to the test questions used,
so if you nail these key points, you won't fail.
H-Huh?
Mi-Mizutani-san?
I still don't know what they're thinking,
but I think I can understand how they feel.
Haru.
Do you want to go to the offline gathering?
Yep!
Well, he's set on going,
so you need to pass the make-ups.
M-Mitty!
The make-ups are tomorrow.
Is that enough time?
What?
No turning back now.
Stop sleeping!
Why can't you memorize a simple formula?!
Evil!
You realize I'm pulling an all-nighter for you?!
Why are you kids studying here?
Stop sleeping!
Can I go home yet?
Thanks to my hard work,
Natsume-san was exonerated from the remedial class.
My highest score ever!
But on Monday...
Haru-kun ruined everything!
I'm never going to one of those again.
I didn't get a chance to talk to any girls...
Then, Haru-kun got in a fight.
Moron!

When I logged on to the community again,
everybody gave me the cold shoulder.
High School Community
Told you so.
I quit.
Hey!
Yoshida-kun! Ow!
How many times must I tell you not to bring this rooster?! Ow!
Oh.
I forgot to tell you.
Huh?
Sasahara-kun volunteered to take care of the rooster.
Sure, I like fried chicken.
Where are you?
Hey, Shizuku?
Mitty, Haru-kun's looking for you.
He reminds me of when my dad's looking for his socks.
Don't say anything.
If he finds me, it'll get noisy again.
You look tired.
Oh.
I'll buy you something to drink.
To thank you for helping me study.
Finally, some peace and quiet.
I've been spending more time
around other people than I thought was possible,
so I'm exhausted.
Mitty, I bought you some juice...
Shh.
I'm cheering for you, Haru-kun!
Yo.
Ha-Haru?!
When did you...
Oh, I'm missing class!
Go back to sleep.
Why didn't you wake me up?
Hmm?
You were out like a light.
I thought it was cute.
Seriously...
I have to wonder if he's doing this on purpose.
This is the first time I've ever skipped class.
It's a beautiful day.
The old me
would never have known how blue the afternoon sky
looks from the roof.
My world is growing.
What I once considered background noise
is now comforting.
It feels so good.
Haru.
Hmm?
I'm glad we met.
Before, I only cared about studying,
but I'm going to start enjoying myself.
I love you, Haru.
My values are changing.
Perhaps, my world has also changed.
If so,
my world was changed
by Haru.
Natsume-san, do you have a moment?
Y-Yes!
