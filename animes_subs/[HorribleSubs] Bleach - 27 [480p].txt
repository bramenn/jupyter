Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Group 2, take the East Sector!
Group 6, sweep the North West Sector!
Group 3, take South Sector!
Report in when the Ryoka are captured!
Damn! Whered those Ryoka go, anyway?!
Well get you, Ryoka, for sure!
Naturally! Quick, over there!
Before another group finds them!
How come everybodys acting like thugs, all of a sudden?
Rats. A dead end!
Aint you going senile?! Youll get it, you!
What?! Youre the idiot!
Hey, calm down, guys!

Yow! Itll spill! Itll spill!
Dont screw up menial chores! Move it!
Your new perimeter will be West Sector,
from Street 58 to Street 76.
Phew.
Rukia, Ive brought your food
Rukia?
Rukia! Rukia?!
Whos there?
Oh, yesm. Im the caretaker for Rukia Kuchiki.
Where is she?
Youre from Squad 4?
Rukia Kuchiki has already been sent to the Senzaikyu penitentiary.
What?!
B-But
Whats wrong?
OhumI didnt know
A search has been ordered for Ryoka who infiltrated the Seireitei.
Return to your Squad at once.
Rukia
What was that light this morning?
From in here, I cant feel any spiritual energy.
Could it really be?
Ichigo
Dont talk like its ended. I havent shown you my skill yet.
It starts now, Ikkaku.
This time, youll be the one who cant hold your sword!
Fine words. Greenhorn!
Where does that confidence come from?
Slow!
I wont be able to hold my sword?! Dont make me laugh!
Its you who wont hold your sword again!
Wasnt I supposed to be slow?
Humph! You are. That was a fluke.
Ill show you its not a fluke.
I told youtoo slow!
Lucky!
Humph!
Whats wrong? Talk is all you can do?
Hozuki-maru can transform at will.
A greenhorn like you cant keep up, can you?
Thats not true.
Ive finallygotten used to your attack.
This guy
He took Hozuki-maru with his bare hand!
Kenny, over there, over there! Theyre over there!
Weve been running for a while, but havent seen anyone
Dont worry! Ive got super keen intuition!
Oh! Go right! Right!
Its a dead end!
That way, then! Go back, go back!
Are you sure we can trust this intuition of yours?
Uh! Ms. Inoue! Hide!
Found them?! Whered they go?
It looks like we really caused a big commotion.
Itll be difficult to meet up with Kurosaki and the others
before searching for Ms. Kuchiki.
If there was a commotion someplace, wed find one of them there.
Perhaps we should just jump in
Or What do you think, Ms. Inoue?
Huh?
Ms. Inoue?
W-Whered she go?
Ishida-a-a!
Huh?!
What happened, anyway?!
Sorry! I went scouting, and they spotted me!
Since theyve seen us, Ill have to fight!
Ill fight, too!
No! Leave this to me!
They stopped! Get them!
Dont worry. You stand back.
But
Found them!
Get them!
Yow!
We found them!
So many! Can you beat them, Ishida?
Run!
Theyre running! After them! After them!
Whats that?
Is it Ichigo? Or?
Whats wrong, Ikkaku?
Dont look so surprised.
I hope you havent lost your nerve.
If you wont attack, I will!
Ill say it again, Ikkaku!
The one who wont be able to hold his sword
is you!
D-Dammit!
Heh! Whats wrong? Its over already?
Too bad! I can still hold my sword!
If you want to make me stop, youll have to cut off my arm!
Put down your sword.
No way!
Dont! The fights over! You know it! You lost!
Rubbish. This is a fight. Its over only when one is left alive!
Slow!
Damn You sureare strong
Crap I wasnt lucky
Neither of us was luckybastard
Whered he go?!
That was close!
When will you stop running?
When you give up.
Stop, already.
Im getting tired of this.
Ill end it nowwith my
Fuji Kujaku.
Heh, heh. End it, you say?
Id say
Dont be so hasty!
S-Stop it! How disagreeable!
My beautiful eyes are smarting!
Howd you like that?!
The Kukaku brand hot-pepper smoke bomb!
The Tears-of-Blood is powerf-
Whats this?! My eyes hurt!
Ouch, ouch!
My throat, too!
What do you think of this power?
Unbelievable! You harmed yourself with your own strategy.
Too ugly!
I breathed it in.
W-Where are you?!
H-Hey. Let go!
How can I?!
How comeIm still alive?
Youre awake?
Yo.
Ichigo
Why are you still here?
Well, I learned something
The released Zanpaku-to returns to its original form
when the owner goes unconscious.
My Hozuki-maru!
Bastard! Give it back!
Im not gonna take it.
I just used some of the medicine in it to stop the bleeding.
But it sure works great, this medicine!
B-Bastard! That was dirty!
Why?! Sure, I used it up, but thats no reason to get so mad.
Thats not it!
Damn! I knew something was wrong!
I didnt die, even after losing so much blood!
I cant live on like thisin shame.
Damn! If I could only move, Id beat you to a pulp!
Crap. Whats with you? Shouldnt have saved you.
Well, appreciate it or not, it doesnt much matter to me.
All I want are some answers.
Humph. I knew something like this was coming.
I sure am unlucky.
What do you wanna know? When my birthday is?
Wheres Rukia Kuchiki?
Let go, youre heavy
Dammit! Cant hold on!
No!
Please! Dont let go! If we fall in there!
Those who fall in can never get out.
Cant holdon!
I dont wanna die! Help!
W-Whats with this place?!
Pee-yew!
Hey, you! I thought you said nobody could ever get out of here!
This is an ordinary garbage dump.
Never mind that How dare you plunge me in here!
Youll pay!
Woah!
You made yourself fall!
Shut up!
Stop! Running again?!
Im running!
Kuchiki?
Yeah.
That Kyokushu?
What do you guys want with somebody like her?
We came to save her.
How many of you came?!
At least 7 or 8, right?
No
Five humans and one animal.
What? One animal?
You seriously intend to rescue her with so few?!
Thats right!
Y-Youll never pull off something like that!
Are you stupid, or something?!
I-I laughed so hard, my wound opened up!
I dunno whos the stupid one.
Ahh. Well, all right
Directly south from here are the stations
for each of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads
H-Huh? Youre going to tell me?
Shut up! Just listen! Or I wont tell you!
At the west end of the stations is a white tower.
She should be there
I-Is that true?
Youre doubting me?!
I have no interest in whatever you want with the girl.
Save her, if thats what you want.
Hey, get going, or other Reapers will find you!
Go, if youre going!
Ohyeah
So long. I owe you, Ikkaku.
Dont. Its annoying.
Wait a minute.
Can I ask you something?
Whos the strongest in your group?
Its me, probably
Is that so? Watch out for my captain, then.
Captain has no interest in weak men.
If what you say is true, youre the one hell be after!
Hes strong?
Meet him, and youll find out how strong he is.
That is, if you stay alive long enough when you meet.
Whats his name?!
Captain of the Squad 11, Kenpachi Zaraki.
Crap.
Another dead end?!
You were the first in pursuit. You have no sense of direction!
Fool! Were stuck because I trusted in your so-called intuition”!
Never mind! Lets move on.
Aye, aye, sir!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll alway stay close to you
Now and forever
No sense of fashion! None!
I've always wondered
Are Soul Reapers happy with their look? I can't understand it!
That's why I despise Soul Reapers.
Ishida, the Soul Reapers are still your enemies, aren't they?
That's the reason?!
