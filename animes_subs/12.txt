Takanashi Rikka
Message
O kay.
O kay.
Okay.
Mr. Togashi Yuuta
On Patrol
Rikka.
Mom wants you to come say goodbye to Dad.
This is the last chance you'll have to physically touch him.
Please take the time to do so.
You okay?
Yeah. I'll be fine.
It's cold.
Why don't you wash it?
If you just pour it from the top, Dad's gonna get cold.
Dad...
Oh, morning.
There's a letter for you.
It's on your desk.
Thanks.
I know!
What was I supposed to do?
Rikka!
Are you there, Rikka?
I'm so stupid!
Takanashi?
I haven't really heard from her.
Don't tell me you two got in a fight.
No, it's not like that...
Yeah, right! You totally did!
Excuse me...
Who're you?
Oh, you're so funny.
I'm Dekomori!
Dekomori Sanae.
Bleh!
Are you not well?
Did you eat a dark plant?
Who'd eat something like that?!
You're the one who's creeping me out!
What the hell did you do to your hair?
I thought I was getting a little old for pigtails. Don't you think, my dear senior?
Stop that! You're killing me here!
Hang in there!
Stop it!
Hearing you talk like that makes my skin crawl.
Please, let go of me!
A woman's hair is vital!
You can't just grab on to it as you please.
This is totally out of left field!
What happened?
Well... I spent a lot of time thinking after what happened...
Like about Master... I mean, Takanashi.
And about what you said.
Yuuta!
Kumin... Kumin's...
Wait, who's this cutie?
See?
Hey, Tsuyuri, is your eye all right?
Yes. I'm fine.
Did you catch a cold?
I wish...
I'll be all right.
If I drink this...
What's that?
You wanna know?
Uh, I...
Kumin...
My goodness, she does look rather strange.
How shameful.
Like you can talk.
Ow!
That deathly hurt!
Huh? Death?
You're that middle schooler?
Little slow on the uptake, aren't we?
So you've come...
Dark Flame Master!
Please don't call me that.
Do you want to see my eye?
No, thank you.
What? You can't say that...
But...
Anyway, what's with the Rikka impression?
This is no mere act.
I inherited it...
from the wielder of the Wicked Eye.
Inherited it?
Yes.
On the final eve of the new moon, I was entrusted with the full measure of that dark power.
In other words, I am the Wicked Eye's successor.
Does that thing really need a successor?!
But of course.
The Wicked Eye must live on.
So long as the Dark Flame Master draws breath.
Is that what Rikka said?
Yes.
Wow, that sounds so... deathly cool!
And whose side are you supposed to be on?
Well, that didn't take long to clean up.
Yeah.
Looking back at it, we really weren't doing much.
By the way, how was the Drama Club?
Oh, I went to check it out.
But...
But what?
The President's a bit over-enthusiastic.
They were like, we'll do things no one has ever done before!
And we'll pave the way for a new age!. That kind of thing.
Oh, one of those people...
I mean, I have no problem with enthusiasm.
It's just... this really seemed like a case of eighth-grader syndrome to me.
Was it really eighth-grader syndrome?
Maybe not exactly, but like...
I got the impression they felt like they were different to other people.
Like they were special because they could see something others couldn't.
It felt like they were a bit full of themselves, you know?
I mean, remember how we both wanted to put our eighth-grader syndrome behind us
and just be normal high schoolers once we got here?
Yeah.
But I think we were just caught up in our own ideas of what a normal high schooler should be.
What are you trying to say?
Nothing much.
Just that maybe everyone always has some kind of syndrome, you know?
That's deep.
No...
You're just shallow.
Oh, don't worry about it. I'll do the dishes.
You sure?
I don't want you to break any more of them.
I don't break them that much, do I?
I understand you're sad because Takanashi's gone, but...
She's not gone.
And I'm not sad.
What?
You mean you don't know?
The movers came in the evening, and...
Rikka!
Rikka!
Goddamn it! Why?
You said you'd come back.
You said you'd be right back!
I don't think you can make it at this hour.
The train you need doesn't run this late.
I see...
Rikka...
Mom, Grandpa, and Grandma all looked so happy.
They were so relieved when I said that I'd do it.
So I think I made the right choice.
You agree, right, Yuuta?
Right...
This all started with me.
I told her to take off her eyepatch...
and leave her eighth-grader syndrome behind.
It was me.
From... Dark Flame
When you read this letter, you may no longer be the Dark Flame Master.
Because in 2012, as per the Mayan prophecy,
the world will be devastated by wave of destruction, weakening your mental energy.
You may have attained enlightenment and abandoned your destiny,
reducing yourself to a pathetic commoner, content simply to enjoy life.
I sense that this is the case.
That is why I have written you this letter.
Do not be fooled, Dark Flame Master.
You have power.
You were chosen by the Dark Lord.
You, and nobody else.
You are special.
I wrote this to myself in two years when I was in eighth grade.
Some letter, huh?
This is so stupid.
It's just a token from one of the local arcades.
It doesn't have any special powers.
But...
Tails, huh...
I guess this is fate.
Not that I mind, but where are you going in the middle of the night?
I'm going to go get Rikka.
You're going
Wait, are you serious?
This isn't what I wanted.
This isn't what I wanted to say or do for her.
Halt.
Dark Flame Master. I, wielder of the Second Wicked Eye, bear a message for you.
Hey, did Dad die?
Rikka...
It didn't feel like it had really happened.
In fact, I couldn't feel anything at all.
Because I thought he'd get better for sure.
I thought that until the morning he passed away.
Rikka...
That's when I met Yuuta.
Me?
Rikka said that?
Yes. Rikka...
I mean, the Wicked Eye found you two years ago.
When she went to the Priestess's place.
We're moving?
Yeah. Grandpa said we can live with them.
Then what'll happen to our place?
I understand.
Nothing we can do, right?
Rikka...
Ow, ow... Ow!
Hey!
The air drips heavy with malice.
They must be close by.
I watched him every day since then.
What? Over there?
And another one here?
Finally, I will...
Who's there?
I sense that I'm being watched.
Rikka thought it was wonderful that you could think like that.
She thought you were so much cooler than she was because you were true to yourself.
Then what...
was... her eighth-grader syndrome?
Rikka is a girl who was saved by her eighth-grader syndrome.
From the moment she laid eyes on you, she came to admire it.
She was bewitched by your power and tried to follow you in your footsteps.
That's why she came to you!
It couldn't have been anyone else!
Rikka was...
always, always, always...
always...!
Rikka!
Yuuta.
Oh, I need to water the plants.
Yuuta!
I am not this Yuuta!
Yuuta!
Takanashi Rikka!
No, wielder of the Wicked Eye!
I have something I must show you.
Yuuta...
Make...
a contract with me!
Who's that?
A burglar?
What the hell are you doing up there?
Crap...
Dear! Call the police!
Rikka, come!
But...
Are you satisfied with this boring reality?
Or will you choose to rewrite it with me?
Yuuta!
Dear!
Rikka!
Yuuta!
Rikka!
Rikka!
Excuse me!
What are you doing up there?
It's not what it looks like!
Help! A molester! Help!
Come on, do your part already!
What, I'm the molester?
Hehe! I'm gonna feel you all over!
Help!
Hey, stop right there!
Oh, crap! It's not what it looks like!
What are they doing here?
Now, hurry up and go!
You too?
We asked Deko to give us a ride.
Take these too.
Stop!
Come back!
My leg's cramping up!
Want me to pedal?
Don't fret.
With the Dark Flame Master's power... this is... nothing!
The lights are...
Yeah, they're beautiful.
But those are just cruise liners.
They're just ordinary lights.
Get off.
This is the power of darkness.
Blast reality.
Burst it into shreds.
Banishment...
this world!
Yuuta.
This is the Ethereal Horizon.
The lights are watching you.
Tell them.
Tell them your feelings.
The true feelings you've been holding back.
Goodbye...
Goodbye, Dad!
Goodbye!
People always say they feel awkward about having eighth-grader syndrome.
They say that they don't want to talk about it, that they want to forget about it for good.
But does that really get rid of our crazy old selves and their wild fantasies...
back when we thought we were special, when we thought something greater watched over us?
People sometimes tell lies, imagine a completely different fantasy world, dream about the distant future,
or invent a lover's relationship that only exists inside their heads.
This process repeats from the day we are born until the day we die. Forever and ever.
It is depressing.
It is shameful.
But it is dear to us.
It is an illness known as self-consciousness.
It is something we must all face known as ourselves.
Indeed, we carry our eighth-grader syndrome throughout all of our lives.
Man, it's cold.
Do you want to see my eye?
But to be honest, it's an embarrassing thing to have.
She's the cute girl from the mochi store.
Tamako Market!
Let's look for a
sparkling daydream...

No one ever understands me

Overheated, reaching its limit
