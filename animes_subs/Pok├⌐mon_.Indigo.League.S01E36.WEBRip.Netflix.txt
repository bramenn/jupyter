Our hero Ash, along with his friends Misty and Brock,
continues on his quest to become a Pokemon Master.
Tired from their adventures,
they decided to take a break in a quiet forest.
Pi, pi... Pika.
Cha!
The air's so fresh, and the water's beautiful.
What a great place this is for a rest.
Yeah, it sure is nice to kick back and relax a little.
- Kanga, Kangaskhan! - Huh?
This is fun!
Ash, look out, that tree!
Huh?
Wah!
-Jungle boy. -He'll never learn.
Pika, pi. Pikachu.
- - Pika?
Pi?
Pika!
Pi!
Pi? Pikachu?
Huh? Pikachu? Huh?
Pikachu.
Pikachu?
Hey! Where you going, Pikachu?
-Where's Pikachu running to? -I don't know, Misty.
Maybe it saw something out there in the woods.
Pi?
- Huh? -Pika!
What's that?
It's amazing. Look at all the Pikachu.
Pika.
Those must be wild Pikachu.
I've never seen so many Pikachu in one place.
Pika, pika!
Pi. Pika!
Pika?
Pi? Pika?
Pika.
Pika! Pika.
=Pikachu! -
Huh?
Pi? Pika?
Pikachu.
Pika. Pika!
-Pikachu! -Pika!
Pika!
-Pi? -Pi?
Pika? Pi?
Pika?
Pi.
Pika!
-Pikachu! -Pikachu.
Pika.
Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Aw.
It looks like they've finally accepted Pikachu as part of their group.
-All right! - Huh?
Hey!
I want to be part of your group too.
Pika, pi!
Hey, wait up! Huh?
Hey, don't run away.
Quit it, Ash.
But why?
Don't you understand? Those Pikachu are scared of you, Ash.
Huh?
Pika.
-I'm sorry, Pikachu. -Pi.
But why would those Pikachu be afraid of me?
I wouldn't do anything to hurt them.
They probably haven't had much contact with humans before.
Yeah, I don't think too many people come this far into the forest, Ash.
This place must be perfect for those Pikachu.
You mean like a Pikachu paradise?
I'd sure hate to do anything that would disturb all those Pikachu here.
Yeah, me neither.
Yeah.
-Pi! Pi! -Pika?
Pi! Pika! Pika!
-What's that? -It's one of those Pikachu!
-Pika! -
-Pika! Pika! Pika! -
Pika! Pikachu!
Ash, we have to try to save it!
Quick. It's headed for the waterfall!
Pika! Pika! Pika!
Pi.
Pikachu!
- -Pikachu!
Pika!
Pika! Pika!
Pikachu! Pikachu! Pikachu!
Pi!
Pikachu!
Pika!
Pikachu!
Pika!
Pikachu! Pikachu! Pikachu!
- -Pikachu!
Kachu!
Ah!
Pika, pi.
Pika.
Pika!
Pika! Pika! Pika!
Pika! Pika! Pika...
Pika! Pika! Pika!
Oh! Huh?
Pi.
Pi...
Pika?
-Pi! Pi! -Pi?
Pika? Pikachu!
-Pika. -Pikachu.
Pika!
-Pika! - Pika! Pika! Pika!
Pika! Pika! Pika!
Just look at all of them.
Pikachu to the left. Pikachu to the right.
Piles of Pikachu everywhere.
If we turn over this many Pikachu to the boss...
We'll be promoted for sure.
I'm so proud to be part of this team.
Everything in this forest is public property.
And we're all members of the public.
So that means all these Pikachu are really our property.
Right!
Shh!
-Those Pikachu sure are having fun. -Looks like it.
Misty, Ash. Dinner'll be ready in just a few minutes.
Oh, it looks like Pikachu sure is fitting in well.
Yeah.
I think it's the best thing in the world for Pikachu to be here with its own kind.
Huh?
-Pika, pika. -Pika!
Thanks, Brock. That was a delicious dinner.
What can I say? I'm a great cook.
Maybe it's because the vegetables around here are so tasty.
Don't you think so, Ash?
Ash?
- Hey, Ash. -Huh?
Ash, what's wrong? Is something bothering you?
You don't look so good. Do you feel okay?
Never felt better. Everything's fine.
Hm?
This place must be perfect for those Pikachu.
I think it's the best thing in the world for Pikachu
to be here with its own kind.
Here with its own kind.
Oh! Aw. Hmm.
- -Huh?
Wha..? What is that sound?
-Pika. -Pi.
-They're trapped. -Who could have done this to them?
Pikachu! Pikachu!
Pika, pi! Pikachu!
Who's there?
Prepare for trouble.
Make it double.
Those voices.
To protect the world from devastation...
To unite all peoples within our nation...
To denounce the evils of truth and love...
To extend our reach to the stars above...
Jessie.
James.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Meowth.
Team Rocket!
That's right!
We'd like to thank all of our fans for their loyalty and support.
This victory is for them.
And now you're about to witness Team Rocket's finest performance.
Cut the speeches, and let's swipe these Pikachu. Ha!
You're not swiping anything.
Pikachu, break the ropes with an electric shock.
Pi. Pikachu!
Pika, pika.
They're no match for our new Pikachu-insulated seizure net.
You might as well just give up.
It's made from environmentally-safe material
that absorbs electricity.
-That's very thoughtful of you. -Let those Pikachu go now.
Nyah-nyah.
We've got to save the Pikachu.
-Yeah! -Right!
Why don't you check out our website?
Hey, let us out of this stupid thing!
You're not going to get away with this!
Time to make our exit.
- Roger! - Wait!
Oh! Pikachu!
Pika, pi!
It's a Pika-palooza.
We're at the pika our powers.
Chu can say that again, Jess.
Ah. It's good to be on top.
Wha... We got a pika problem down below.
What?
Huh?
- Quit it! - Hey! Stop that!
- Pikachus, cut it out. Stop. - What are you doing? Hold it.
Quit it! Stop!
Pika!
Ah! It's coming.
-Ooh. Huh? Ooh! Catch it, James!
There, grab it.
All right, we're free!
Watch out, Team Rocket.
Hey, Pikachu, jump onto this!
Hurry up!
Pika!
Chu!
All right, that's the way.
Come on, keep on jumping!
Pika! Chu!
Pika!
Chu!
Chu!
Pika!
Pika! Chu!
-Pikachu. -Chu!
Pika!
Pika.
Pikachu.
This rodent's bugging me.
Huh?
All the Pikachu have gotten away!
Huh?
Not again.
But wait.
There's one Pikachu left.
Let's grab it.
Pika.
Oh. We're blasting off again.
Pikachu!
Pika, pi!
You did it, Pikachu!
Pika, pi!
Pika, pika!
Pika, pika! Pi?
Pi! Pikachu!
Ah! Pikachu!
-Pika, pika. -Pika!
Pika!
Pikachu! Pikachu! Pikachu!
Pikachu! Pikachu!
Pikachu! Pikachu! Pikachu!
Pikachu! Pikachu! Pikachu!
Hmm.
-They all made it back safely. -Yeah. Ash really trained Pikachu well.
You did a great job, Ash.
Huh?
- Ash? - Where are you going, Ash?
What? You're leaving Pikachu?
That's right.
But, Ash, what are you doing? This is crazy.
My mind's made up.
Huh?
Pikachu.
Pika, pi. Pikachu?
-Pikachu, you stay here. I'm leaving. -Pi.
I know you'll be much happier here in the forest with the other Pikachu.
Pika, pi.
Goodbye, Pikachu.
Pika, pi!
Please don't.
Pika.
All of these Pikachu here in the forest need you.
So just... Goodbye.
- Huh? -Pika, pi!
Goodbye!
Pikachu.
Pikachu was my very first Pokemon.
