I have two important announcements today.
First, I need to introduce a transfer student.
She's a foreign exchange student.
A foreign exchange student?
Come in.
I'm Leila Overlock.
I'm also an adventurer at one of the guilds.
I hope we can all be friends.
I hope she punches me.
What's wrong with those boys?
Oh, for crying out loud.
She's from Lahmu...
That's Leila. I never thought she'd end up in our class.
You know him?
Yes.
Then I guess you can sit next to Noir.
That's how these things work.
It's nice to see you again.
Likewise.
Hey, don't just pay attention to Noir!
He's already tight with Emma!
Quiet!
Now, here's the next announcement.
This might be a lot to take in for your first day in class,
but it has to do with the special lesson the rest of us had been discussing prior.
Special lesson?
Yeah. Apparently, it's a tradition at the Hero Academy.
You! What's the special lesson?
The training camp!
You! And what's a training camp mean?
We're going on vacation!
And if we're going on a vacation... Say it!
Hot springs!
And then, the day of our training camp arrived.
I know hot springs sound fun and all,
but there'll be monsters along the way.
Stay on your toes.
Yes, ma'am!
Do you go to hot springs often, Leila?
This is my first time since coming here.
I'm glad you could join us, Maria.
Yes, I'm feeling just fine now.
Apparently, the hot spring we're visiting today is known to be great for your skin!
Hot springs! Hot springs!
Hot springs! Hot springs!
Emma's always loved baths.
We used to take them together when we were little.
Hot springs!
E-Emma, I know you're really excited,
but maybe you shouldn't get in the hot spring.
What?! Why not?!
Well...
I heard this hot spring's out in the open.
Which means...
So that's what's going on.
We'll need to keep our guard up.
I can sense their lust all the way over here.
Well, I guess it's okay if I'm seen.
Th-Th-That's not okay!
I'm kidding, jeez!
I figured you'd stop anyone from peeking in, Noir.
Right?
Indeed. I'm sure Noir will protect us.
I see the girls trust you, Noir.
Th-That's...
We're counting on you, Noir!
Yeah!
Uh, I don't know about this...
I'm exhausted!
I'm soaked in sweat.
I want to get in the hot spring already!
We may be on vacation, but we'll be training, too.
Your hubris and carelessness can lead to trouble.
Be prepared for anything.
Don't worry! We're elites!
I saw plenty of fools like you when I was a mercenary.
Of course, they never lasted long.
Do you know why?
I-I have no idea...
Because they die.
Extremely dangerous monsters live here on Mt. Amora.
Make sure you all figure out your lines and formations.
I'm going to do my best not to interfere.
Lines and formations? What are we supposed to do, exactly?
Since the boys are good at CQC, we'll have them up front.
Most of the girls use magic, so we'll support from behind.
I'll be the rear guard.
Awesome, Leila! You totally know what you're doing!
I go hunting monsters with my guildmates all the time.
She's got both wit and beauty.
And soon, we'll see her...
It doesn't seem like any monsters are around, but what if there are traps somewhere?
Don't worry. I have the Trap Perception skill.
I just want to get to the hot spring,
but I doubt my troubles will end there.
Noir, step back.
Talk about a close call.
Th-Thanks, Hjorth.
It's nothing. I don't need a reason to help out my friends.
Peek.
Look! How cute!
That's a rare wildflower.
But who put a pitfall here?
I know who did it.
The people who dug that hole are bad people called bandits.
Who are you?
I'm a pixie. I'm not a bad monster.
Yeah, she doesn't look bad.
She's so cute!
She's like a little fairy!
She's so little and cute!
I'm pretty sure pixies trick humans...
Pixie Lv. 5
Skill
That Monster Puppetry skill is a bit concerning.
As for Ms. Elna...
Guess this is all up to us students.
You're all headed to the hot spring, aren't you?
I know a shortcut!
A shortcut? Tell us!
We want to get there fast!
This way.
Score!
I guess some monsters can be good.
We can finally get in the hot spring!
It's just about a five-minute walk to the hot spring.
It's pretty dark in here, and the formation we came up with is shot now.
Oh, we'll be fine.
If it seems dangerous, we can turn back.
And I can detect traps, remember?
Yeah, but...
Why did you draw your sword?
Just in case. I'm a bit of a coward.
But it's scary! Please put it away.
But, I mean...
Wait!
Those holes... I think something might be hiding in them.
There's nothing in them.
If there were any monsters, I'd get attacked.
True, but you have the Monster Puppetry skill.
You're using that skill to control some monsters
so they'll ambush us, right?
Wait, seriously?
I guess there's no point in hiding it anymore!
Get them, Lizardmen!
G-Guys!
We just need to regroup, get back into formation,
and deal with them one by
Get them!
We're definitely going to peek...
Don't get in our way!
You guys want to peek that badly?!
Crap! The girls!
Demon Fist!
You're not gonna stand between me and my hot spring!
This hot spring must be something else...
Th-This wasn't supposed to happen...
H-Humans are all ugly and stupid!
Die! Nyah!
Bestowing Weight + 10 Kilograms.
Now do you understand?
There are monsters that try to act innocent to lure you into traps,
so you need to be careful
Hey!
Look over there! I see it!
Yeah!
We're here!
I'm beat!
I want to wash all my sweat off.
Like any of you are listening.
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter!
You must be from the Hero Academy.
The bathing times are designated and split between the men and the women.
It's currently open only for our lady guests.
Hot spring! Hot spring!
That was rather tiring.
Yes. I'd love to wash off all this sweat immediately, but...
Ladies, please. Not to worry.
We may be rotten, but we are still students of the Hero Academy.
We are heroes! Therefore, we would never ever do something so wrong
as practice voyeuristic activities!
We would never!
W-Well, if you say so...
I guess...
This must be thanks to the fact that we defeated those monsters together!
I'm so glad they changed their min
You guys wanna go see some naked girls?!
Yeah!
I-I was naIve...
The time has come!
Let's do this!
Burn that sight into your eyes!
I am the one who proposed a plan to nurture these young men,
and I shall also act as your leader. My name is Hjorth Boyle.
Despite our pure, fiery passion,
we must do everything we can to avoid being labeled peeping toms!
That's why we're using these!
Hell yeah! This is perfect!
Let's do this!
I put it on backwards!
Noir, here's yours.
Oh, uh...
What's wrong? Hurry up.
I-I don't...
We're counting on you, Noir!
Yeah!
I can't participate in this.
He's a traitor! Capture him!
We can finally relax.
Yeah!
Hey, did you see the bath?
I did. It's so big!
And the view is lovely.
Okay! I'm getting in first!
Hold it!
Traitor!
Go, go, go! Head right into the women's bath!
I-I have to stop them somehow!
There! That's it!
Oh, no...
Earthen Wall.
Ow...
Ms. Elna! Perfect timing!
I never thought you'd be the one, Noir...
If you thought you could sneak a peek, you've got another thing coming.
N-N-No! I'm trying to stop the other boys, too!
Uh-huh...
Do not falter! Advance!
I'm afraid your words aren't enough.
I know...
I'm going to rake you across the coals.
Your backs are wide open!
Stone Bullet!
Earthen Bullet!
Boobies...
Butts...
Armpits...
Napes...
Th-They're so persistent.
I guess you all want more punishment.
I don't want any meaningless bloodshed.
Do not get in the way of the villainous organization Dark Sword.
Didn't you say something about a plan to nurture young men earlier?
What? I have no idea what you're talking about.
That voice... You must be Hjorth.
I guess it's futile now.
Noir, I'll take care of things here.
Even you can't stop me right now, Ms. Elna!
M-Ms. Elna! Are you okay?
Noir, you saved me... So I'll let this slide.
Huh?
Move your hands already.
I-I'm so sorry!
Did you see that?!
You're more powerful than usual. You did something, didn't you?
You figured it out?
Yes... It's all so I can see the girls in our class naked!
I collected tons of magical potions and items to make myself more muscular!
I used my whole life savings!
Your stupidity is on another level.
You did all that just to see your classmates naked?
Just to? Just to see that?!
Of course I did!
I get excited because they're my classmates!
True lewdness is best when it's within reach!
I'd risk my life for that, you asswipe!
O-Oh... My bad, I guess.
W-We can clearly see you're passionate about this,
but I think there's a line you shouldn't cross.
Hey, come on. Be honest with yourself, Noir.
This is what guys dream about. This is our dream.
I mean, I get it... I'm a guy, too.
You want to see them, too, don't you?
Then go ahead and look!
Come on! Let's go look!
He's got a point. He's got a point, but...
I can't hurt any girls' feelings over our selfish desires!
Huh?
Naked girls are precious!
Cheating to get a peek is despicable!
You stupid... little traitor!
Noir!
It's okay!
Hjorth has powered up his muscles to their limits.
He's dangerous!
This is a fight over a true man's conviction! I can't lose!
I will get to the women's bath no matter what!
I-I won't let you!
Heh! The one who has stronger ideals will always win the battle!
I guess that's all you've got.
I'm gonna get a good eyeful of Emma naked.
I-I can't lose...
I'll Get Creative and make the Powerless skill...
and Bestow it on him!
Noir Stardia LP. 2200
Get Creative, make, and Bestow to Hjorth
Wha
I'm not...
going to lose in this battle of determination!
Looks like it's all over.
I got to witness your true determination.
Ms. Elna...
What's so funny?
Too bad. We still won.
Go forth! Our short and unnoticeable speedster, Kent!
I was just playing possum! Don't worry, guys! I've got you!
I'll make sure to write a report about my findings!
H-Hold it!
I'll be right there, girls!
He's so fast!
Maybe I can Bestow Heavy on him...
Get Creative, make, and Bestow to Kent
LP needed: 2000
Two thousand?!
I guess it costs more to affect skills they're good at.
Almost there...
I'll only have 200 LP left if I do that.
I'd be risking my life, but...
Emma's colossal melons! I'm gonna get an eyeful!
I'm going to stop him!
Noir Stardia LP. 2200
Noir Stardia LP. 200
Get Creative, make, and Bestow to Kent
My legs...
Okay!
He just won't give up!
We win, suckers!
Oh, no, you don't!
Girls! Get out of the bath right now! There's a peeping tom!
Huh?
Noir? What are you doing?
Huh? What are you girls doing? I thought you were going to take a bath.
We got undressed and were about to...
But then Ms. Elna told us to hold off.
S-So she managed to stop you...
Looks like you kept your promise.
Thanks to you, they didn't fall victim to the boys' evil schemes.
Th-Thank goodness...
Noir?! What's wrong?
I-I used up too much LP...
Noir? Noir?!
This is the best!
It feels so nice!
My skin feels so smooth!
It's so warm!
Don't remove the towel on your eyes or your waist.
M-Ms. Elna...
Don't worry. I trapped the boys in their room.
Let us see them naked!
Let us out!
Please!
Let us out!
It's all thanks to you that we were able to stop the boys from peeping,
so as a reward, you can bathe with us.
I-I get to bathe with you?
You fought for the girls, so I'll allow that much.
Right, girls?
Sure!
We're all grateful, Noir.
S-So this is a man's...
Ah, so this is how your muscles look.
Y-You're far more...
A-Are they enjoying a helpless guy?
Noir, you don't have enough LP, right?
In that case...
E-Emma?! What is that you're pressing against my face?
It's a secret!
I guess I'll use these instead of my ass this time.
Ms. Elna, too?!
These seem softer than last time!
How disgusting.
This is quite a thrilling sight.
I'm a girl, and I'm still getting jealous.
I-Is this what this school's always like?
Take that!
And this, too.
Well, Noir? Does that feel nice?
Take that!
My LP easily surpassed 10,000 that night.
Next time, Noir's Decision.
