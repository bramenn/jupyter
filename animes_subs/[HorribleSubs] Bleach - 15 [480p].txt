Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate; life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
A Menos appeared and he defeated it.
This news will eventually reach the Soul Society.
Ichigo
KUROSAKI CLINIC
Ichigo!
What's the big idea so early in the morning?
You had a realization or something?
Shut up! It's what your sister did!
A washing was enough, but she went and!
Looks good on you.
Yuzu must've felt sorry'cuz you were so dirty.
Shut up!
She even put this ornament on my ear!
And she used super glue! It won't come off!
Let's see
Cripes! She thinks I'm just a stuffed toy andOwwee!
Hey! What're you doing?! Owwee!
I thought it'd come off if I pulled hard enough.
N-No!
No good. I think your ear'll come off first.
Why you-!
Look at the time! I'd better hurry!
Breakfast! Breakfast!
D-Damn it
Why am I the only one who's always treated like this?!
Am I not a comrade?! Am I not an equal?
Well then, I'll leave on a journey.
And I'll find the one who will be kind to me!
The place where I truly belong!
Hey Rukia, time to leave for school!
Huh? Hey Rukia!
Pipe down! I can hear you fine.
Huh? Something happen?
It's nothing.
I'm just tired from yesterday's incident.
If that's all
I'm going ahead.
What's with her?
So I stormed out of the house.
But I wonder
I have no money, so I can't go that far.
Huh?
What's that?
Pick me up! You're Ichigo's classmates!
Girls can't resist picking up a cute stuffed animal.
Yes! Perfect!
Oh what acute stuffed animal
Dirty stuffed animal. Oof!
Eh? Huh?
S-Shucks...
They're staringat me.
It just spoke, didnt it?
Yes, it did.
I guess it can't be helped in a case like this
It's running away!
Ryo Kunieda, Karakura High School Track Team.
I run the 100 meters in 12 seconds flat! You won't outrun me!
No! Why?! All I wanted was some kindness!
In short
Huh?
Kuchiki! Good morning!
Good morning, Inoue.
Let's walk together.
Of course, with pleasure.
But you really come early, don't you?
Of course. It's almost summer vacation, right?
I kept thinking about it and can't sleep, like, sparkle!
I see!
Oh yes! Kuchiki, do you have any plans for the summer?
Not really.
There's a huge Fireworks Festival in August.
Tatsuki and the others, we're all planning to go together.
Won't you join us?
A Fireworks Festival?
Yes! We should ask Kurosaki, too.
It'll be like the time we all went to the Burarei program.
I just know it'll be fun.
That was some event, huh?
Uh-huh
But he came along just for his family, he can be very kind.
He has such a fun family, he should lighten up a bit more.
Kurosaki has a permanent frown on his face.
I thought you didn't care too much for Kurosaki.
Not really.
When you take a good look at him, he has an interesting face.
Please come to the Fireworks Festival with us.
I'll think about it.
Okay come on, Tatsuki!
I found you, my goddess Orihime
Earlier was just a rehearsal. Go, Orihime! Hang in there!
Hime! You look great! The real thing starts now.
First, I'll lie there helpless in front of Orihime.
Like the Holy Mother, she is sure to hold me gently,
So cute! and cuddle me in the Valley of the Gods!
Yes! My target has always been Orihime! Her and only her!
Once decided, you must act quickly!
And then, soft, warm cuddles await
Sure Kill! Dragon Bazooka!
A perfect ball!
This isn't supposed to happen!
I did it! A one-run lead!
Yakka = soccer and baseball  Orihime, I think your game of Yakka  isn't fair to the defense.
And a one-run lead isn't cause for a celebration yet!
Huh? Really?
Let's call it a day. Free period's over anyway.
I was just getting warmed up! What're they doing anyway?
Ichigo!
What're you looking at?
Hey hey hey! You were looking at Inoue, weren't you?
Sheesh...talk about well-shaped jugs!
Get offa me! And quit babbling nonsense!
What?!
We're healthy high school boys!
What's wrong with being interested in cute girls?!
All right already! There's nothing wrong with that.
Huh? I get it!
You prefer...the Mizuiro type, huh?!
Both of you! Quit fooling around and start helping over here!
Oh sorry!
There! That's the last of it.
Yes, thanks.
By the way... Ishida hasn't come by yet today.
I saw him yesterday.
At Central Park, mumbling to himself.
And sounding so dramatic, too!
He always acts like he's in a drama. This guy was nearby?
Well, that's true, but... Close call!
I'll bet he's in some theater group.
There were some weird men around him, too.
And there was even an explosion... it was pretty wild.
God, thank you for making him such an idiot!
Ishida!
What happened to those injuries?
I fell...from the stairway.
Yeah. Like, for real.
Hmm...well anyway, take your seat, and let's continue class.
Really? Is it okay? Sure?
Don't let it bother you.
It's not your fault.
He brought it upon himself.
I-I wouldn't worry about injuries like that.
Really? Who said not to worry?
I said don't let it bother you.
Why you-!
Was it a fight?
Ishida? No way!
I can't believe that Ishida was that late... Third period!
Keep it quiet.
Ichigo!
Let's have lunch together!
Sure, but can I invite someone else, too?
What? A new girl? Who?
Ishida
Let's eat lunch together.
What?!
W-Why Ishida?!
Eating with a guy like that can't be fun at all!
I get it! It must be the bandages!
Were those bandages that funny, Ichigo?!
Shut up.
No thanks! So blunt!
C'mon. It's Keigo's treat.
Why?!
Then fine.
Stingy bastard!
I've been suspected from the very beginning.
There's probably not much time left.
Oh, there she is!
Rukia, come and join us for lunch!
Jinta, get serious and sweep properly.
Shut up! This is the age when men are silent and play soccer!
Goodness...
Huh?!
Tessai... Kisuke...
A kitty.
Here you go! Upsy daisy!
What is that cat?
Its name is Yoruichi and it's the Boss's best friend.
Huh? A cat as a best friend? Once more?
I feel sorry for the Boss sometimes. Here! Up and up!
I guess you could say that. Upsy daisy!
T-This is such a painful lunch!
It's like we're cursed.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's only you, Chad.
Why are you so scared?
Shut up! Just leave me alone!
Hey Keigo, say something to cheer us up.
Wha-?!
T-That's impossible!
Hurry it up.
If you're gonna get so moody, you shouldn't have asked Ishida!
Say, I ate saury in Meguro recently.
And the waiter...
Kurosaki, why'd you invite me? I swear...
Out of sympathy for these wounds? He looked like a comedian.
If that's the case, it's misplaced.
And I don't care to be pitied.
Shut up! I just felt like it...that's all.
I didn't ask you because I like you.
So just be grateful I asked at all.
As if I'd be grateful!
Besides, I prefer to eat alone.
I like to be alone when I eat, too.
Well then... Just look the other way.
Why should I be the one to look away? These two...
They're so alike.
All together now!
Tadah! Today's lunch is Castella sandwich!
Castella sponge cake with bean jelly is the ultimate for sweets lovers.
Not again...
Orihime, how come she can eat such things and not gain weight?
All the nutrients are going to her breasts, that's why.
Kuchiki, do you like Kurosaki?
What?
Or, to put it bluntly... Just what is your relationship with Kurosaki?
Well, were frie-
Mahana, that was way too bold!
Why? You're the ones who want to know, but can't ask.
So I popped the question for you.
Err... Well...
I'm not that interested...
Maybe, not you...
You don't care for Ichigo anyway, Michiru.
Well, it's not that I don't like him. His face just looks a bit scary.
Really? I think he has an interesting face.
Huh? When did you get over your fear of Kurosaki?
Well?
What's the story?
Kurosaki is...
Kurosaki is just a friend.
Are you serious? Yes.
You don't feel anything for him? Not at all?
Not at all.
Too bad! If you like Kurosaki, then I'd have to start liking him...
and Tatsuki can start liking him...
and why dont we all start liking him?
Then it would have been a sure win for the girl's team!
This kid is starting her nonsensical rambling again!
A group competition from the start sounds interesting.
But I want Orihime's first happy face to be all mine!
And so... Let's begin with a one-on-one relationship!
Come on, Orihime!
Stop it!
Ughh... That was a nice parry...
That wasn't a parry, it was a punch!
I know! I'll come up...
with a new concoction with bean jam...
So let's eat it together, all right?
Err... I'll think about it.
Not the same answer again!
You keep saying, I'll think about it.
Oh really?
I don't...
I don't belong here.
URAHARA STORE
Why do I have to be treated like this?!
Damn! This is all Ichigo's fault!
You just wait, Ichigo!
I'll use the deadly weapons that weird manager has collected here
and get my revenge!
Huh?! Who are you?!
Wanna fight?!
Just because you're also one of the cat family,
don't put me in the same class as you!
I'm a lion!
Good riddance!
That was easy!
Hmm... Mod Souls can even enter stuffed toys.
Hello!
W-What the-!
Yoroichi told us.
You're that cat from earlier!
Now then... What'll we do with you? Hey, you two!
Hey Ururu, grab his feet! What's the big idea?!
'Kay.
One and two and...! Hey! Cut it out!
Nooo!
Ichigo!
Huh?
What is it?
A Hollow?
No, it's not that.
Are you feeling all right?
Huh? Yeah, there's nothing wrong with me.
I see... Then that's good.
Is there gonna be another one like yesterday?
What would we do if a Menos Grande appeared so easily?
You're...acting a bit strange today.
Did something happen?
Well...
It's...! Huh?
Ichigo!
Sorry I ran away!
I understand now! I realize that my place is with you!
Ichigo!
You ran away? Hey you...
I'm over here!
Ohhh! The world was so cruel to this one who ran away from home.
I'm...I'm going back to your room!
Going back, huh...?
What's wrong?
Nothing. But he's really become attached to you.
He's a pain in the neck.
But look at you! Look, you have stuffing coming out.
Hey! What're you doing?! I'm amazed he didn't die.
Oh well, we'll take you to him. Let go of me!
HANDICRAFT CLUB
Why me?
Why not? I thought this is your specialty.
I refuse.
Why?
I don't need to answer that.
So selfish!
Oh I got it! Can't do a thing with those hands!
Yeah, it's impossible. Yeah...
Can't even thread a needle like that, huh?
How insulting! These wounds are nothing!
Give it here!
And just watch me! The work of a master!
Oh no...
This is a piece of cake for me! What's this...?
Is it all right?
I dunno... What's happening to me?
Finished!
This is...!
Unbelievable...!
Huh?!
Who are you?!
He's been powered up.
Such bad taste.
Pretty bad.
What is this?!
I have high-grade fabric so that I can accept orders at any time.
And the material I used here-
Shut up!
Just cut the crap! Making fun of me and... Huh?!
Huh?!
I'm going to run away, after all!
What's the matter, Yoruichi?
Is it going to rain?
Stop putting on an act, Kisuke.
You know, don't you?
Those guys are here.
Will you talk about it before or after your milk?
Hey Rukia!
It's dinnertime... Huh?
Geez, she went off somewhere again.
Thanks for everything. Rukia
Rear conformity 113!
Neural coefficient 88.5.
Is this for real?
She's actually in a Gigai...
I didn't think the data from the Visuals Department was reliable.
Rukia Kuchiki...
Found you!
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I dont know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move
hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
Youre not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
Ill always be grateful for who you are.
I'm Ishida, president of the Handicrafts Club.
I just want to say one thing...
this episode did not showcase all of my talent.
If I had more time, I could've come up with a more fashionable look.
In time, I'll show you my work that will make your spine tingle.
Just you wait.
Nooo!
