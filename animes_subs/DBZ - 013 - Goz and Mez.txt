Pond of Blood
You are one incredible bastard to try to take the fruit of the Enseiju,
the Tree of Circular Life oni!
You mean I can't eat those?
Of course not oni.
Those are precious fruit that only the Great King Yama- sama may eat oni.
I'm just so hungry, you see...
You're hungry?
You say the most ridiculous things oni. Who are you oni?
What have you come here for oni?
I'm Goku. Son Goku. I came here to train. Which one of you is Kaio- sama?
Kaio- sama?
Then you guys ain't Kaio- sama?
Of course not oni. Where do you think you are oni?
This is the third street of the first district of Hell oni.
We are the watch-keeper ogres of this area oni.
This is Hell!? Then I've fallen down from the Serpentine Road!
Damn it, man, how am I supposed to climb up this thing, for crying out loud?
Hey, Tenshinhan! Don't you leave me behind!
Goku, I will travel the same road that you have!
But I will become even stronger, just you watch!
Ten- san, how do you suppose Kami- sama will train us?
I don't know. But this is Kami- sama, after all.
It will probably be something we couldn't even imagine.
Chaozu, no matter what the training is, don't become disheartened!
Mm-hmm!
This sure is one hard-up house...
What are you doing?
Oh, you know. If there was an airplane capsule or something in here,
I was going to borrow it.
There is nothing like that in there. You should leave here at once.
You do have money in here.
If I do not have it, it's not in there.
Just do as I tell you and give me an airplane!
What is the matter, Noble Father!?
Upa!
It's nothing, Upa.
What are you doing to Noble Father!?
Don't come any closer!
Why, you-!
Huh?
We can kill some time with him for a while oni!
It's been 1500 years since we had a flesh-and-blood dead person here oni!
He seems to be pretty lively, too.
It's been so long since we had someone to make us move about oni.
You can't oni! You've got a mountain of paperwork stacked up oni!
It doesn't matter oni! We have equal responsibility for that oni!
-Then it's no use oni! -You wanna go at it?
-Rock, scissors, paper! -Rock, scissors, paper!
Look that way now!
Work hard, now oni!
Be sure to leave some for me oni!
First come, first served oni!
Maybe this is impossible after all...
What are you doing oni?
You can tell just by watching, can't you?
I want to hurry and get back to the Serpentine Road.
You want to get back that badly, do you oni?
What are you doing!?
I'll send you back oni!
River Sanzu Branch Office
Oh? That Gozu bastard is finishing everything so easily again oni! I knew it!
What a simple-minded, foolish ogre oni!
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
That guy!
Pops, you ain't got any power, huh? I didn't even make it there!
What!?
I'm the second strongest ogre next to Great King Yama- sama in all of Hell oni!
I heard that Great King Yama was incredibly strong,
but maybe he's not all that great.
You want to try taking me on then oni!?
I ain't got that kind of spare time.
If you can beat me in a contest,
I'll give you a chance to get back to the Serpentine Road oni!
It's the jump device we keep just in case oni.
Really?
We don't lie oni.
If we lie, then we get our tongues pulled out by Great King Yama- sama oni.
I'll do it! I'm going to do it!
In exchange, if you lose, you forfeit your soul oni.
You won't be able to keep your body while you're dead oni!
That's fine. I'm going to win, after all.
If you go outside of this line, you lose oni. You got that?
Whatever is fine, let's just do this quickly!
You're one bothersome guy, huh oni?
It takes some preparation... to get ready for this oni...
All right, let's go oni!
You got it!
Take your marks...
You're better than I thought, Pops.
Wha- oni?
U- unbelievable power oni!
Here I go, Pops!
Yow!
This is the jump device, is it?
That's right oni! I'm going to jump up as hard as I can and land up here,
and when I do, you jump oni.
Fine, just hurry up and do it.
All right, here goes!
It's working, it's working!
A little farther...
Ka... me... ha... me...
That did it!
What's with those clouds? They're terribly hard!
To the summit. Please do not litter.
To the summit. Please do not litter. Number 34,265...
number 34,266...
The Original Needle Bean Jam Buns number 34,267...
number 34,267...
number 34,268...
number 34,269...
No one is absent, then.
Today, as I'm sure everyone is looking forward to,
we will be having an outing on the Mountain of Needles oni.
Stay sharp as you ascend and come back down oni.
Hurry up and get going oni. Come on, come on, step on it-
Geez, is he still playing all by himself oni? That's not fair oni!
How long are you going to keep goofing around oni?
It's my turn now oni.
It's no use. No matter how many times I try,
I can't break through those clouds.
Your head is just too soft oni.
But then, has there ever been anyone who has broken through there?
Not yet oni.
What? Have you tricked me!?
Hey, you!
So, in a nutshell, you just want to return to the Serpentine Road, is that right oni?
If so, there's a very good way to do so oni.
Really? Tell me!
There's a secret path that nobody else knows about oni.
Mezu, you can't show him that oni!
Tell me about it! I'm begging you!
There is one condition oni.
Condition?
I'm going to start running around through Hell here oni.
If you are good enough to be able to catch me,
I'll tell you where the secret path is oni.
I'm supposed to chase you?
That's right oni! In this game, you really will have to run like the devil oni!
Over here, over here!
I think this should be enough for today.
Over here, over here!
Hurry, hurry!
Over here, over here!
Are you ready oni?
Any time is fine by me.
I'll just warn you that they say my speed is second only to Great King Yama- sama oni.
If you lose...
I know! Come on, let's hurry and do this.
All right then, let's begin oni. Ready!
He is fast!
Wait up! Wait up, wait up!
Now he'll just run around until he's all worn out oni.
What a waste. And flesh-and-blood dead people are so rare...
You're pretty fast, aren't you oni?
Yeah, I suppose so.
If you weren't, then this wouldn't be any fun oni!
I was so close! And he even dropped his guard, too!
That's awesome! All right, then!
No matter how tough he may be, he can't come all the way up here oni.
W- what oni!?
Hold it!
Hold it!
This is fun oni! How about you live here with us oni?
If you do that, we can play tag every day oni!
You're right! But I can't... let that happen!
What's the matter oni? You'll never get to where Kaio- sama is like this oni!
Damn, I was so close, too.
He's something else oni.
Hold on a minute, would you? I'm all tired out!
You're just a wuss oni...
Say, let me eat some of the fruit on that tree.
No way oni! If you eat one of those precious fruits,
they say that you will avoid hunger for a hundred days,
and your power will be bolstered oni.
They're that valuable, are they?
That's right.
Hey, you! Hold it! If one of those gets eaten,
I'll get chewed out by Great King Yama- sama oni!
Come on! Come on, come on! Hold it oni! Come on! Come on!
Before you know it, the game of chase got switched around oni.
Here goes! Gotcha! I did it!
You idiot oni!
Okay, you promised. Show me the way out.
I was off my guard oni. L- let's do it again oni?
Are you thinking of breaking your promise?
Great King Yama will yank your tongue out!
It's over there oni!
If you climb the stairs inside here,
you'll return to the Serpentine Road oni.
See you later, then!
Get out of here now oni!
Sorry about this, but I took one of them.
Because of you, I'm famished!
See you!
You dumb bastard oni!
Don't come here again oni!
He's gone oni.
There's absolutely nothing to be done about him oni.
Eh, oh well oni.
That was fun oni...
Okay then, to work, to work! There's a mountain of paperwork piled up oni.
Let's go at it as best we can oni.
These stairs sure are long!
Is that the exit?
Huh? It won't move. All right, then!
I made it!
What are you doing in there?
G- Great King Yama- sama!?
Did you see Kaio- sama?
Um, by any chance, is this-? Goodbye!
W- what's with him?
What's this!? I have to start at the beginning again!?
You've got to be kidding!
I really have to hurry now, or I ain't going to have enough time!
That's strange. It's a lot easier to run now than before.
I wonder if that's because of that fruit.
Goku has unexpectedly returned to the starting point.
The road to Kaio-sama's place is incredibly long.
Hurry, Goku! The Saiyans are getting closer every minute!
