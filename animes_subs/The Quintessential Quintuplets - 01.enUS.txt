I was having a dream...
Please wake up, groom.
The bride is ready.
A dream of the unbelievable day that brought us together.
Barbecue beef combo.
Without beef.
Sure thing.
You'd think the cheapest item on this cafeteria's menu would be rice, but no.
Barbecue Beef Combo
Rice Miso Soup Pickled Vegetables
Subtract 200 yen for the beef from the barbecue beef combo,
and you get rice plus miso soup and pickled veggies for the price of rice.
You get free, unlimited water, too.
School cafeteria for the win.
Uesugi-kun's on his own again.
Oh, man.

Yo, who's that?
Someone's sitting with Uesugi?
That never happens!
She isn't wearing our uniform...
Wait, how did this even happen?
I got here first.
The next table over is available.
Move, please.
This is where I sit every day.
You move.
Look, Uesugi-kun's having lunch with a girl.
For real? Yikes!
Tch. Those stupid...
She's all red.
No one forced you, you know.
Udon for 250 yen.
Two shrimp tempura for 150 each.
Squid tempura for 100.
Chicken tempura.
Yam tempura.
And a pudding dessert to top it off!
Yen
Yen
Over 1,000 yen on lunch? What are you, filthy rich?!
Well, do as you like.
Time to eat.
Mind your manners.
Studying in the middle of lunch?
I'm reviewing my exam.
Leave me alone.
You must be pretty screwed.
What did you get?
H-Hey!
Let's see, Uesugi Futaro-kun.
You scored...
O-One hundred?!
Is this real?
Oh, man, that's embarrassing.
You showed me this on purpose!
I hate to admit it, but I'm not great at studies.
I envy you.
I know!
Lady Luck brought you to my table! You should help me study!
Thank you for the meal.
You're done eating already?!
Are you really full?
Shall I share some of mine?
If anything, you ordered way too much.
You'll gain weight.
Gain...
I've never met anyone so insensitive!
I'm not giving you anything!
Uesugi Raiha
Are you eating alone again? Call me o
We can clear our debt?
Dad found a good part-time job.
A rich family moved in just recently,
and they're looking for a tutor for their daughter.
A tutor?
A fun, homely workplace.
And they're paying five times the market price.
Uh, that sounds really sketchy.
I heard people can get by on just one kidney.
Y-You're telling me to give one up?!
I'm kidding.
But now you can eat a bellyful,
Onii-chan.
So what's this daughter like?
She's in high school.
They said she's transferring to your school.
Her name is, uh, Nakano...
Nakano Itsuki.
Pleased to meet you.
I know this girl!
The transfer student's a girl?
She's actually cute.
That uniform's from Kurobara Girls' School, isn't it?
Seriously? She must be rich as hell!
A rich transfer student?
So she's the one?
H-Hey.
Nice to meet you.
U-Uh oh.
Here you go. Barbecue beef combo without the beef.
I messed up yesterday,
but if that transfer student rejects me,
I lose my tutoring opportunity.
I have to get back on her good side.
I'm back. I wanted to sit beside you again.
Of course, not just for lunch, but for studying, too.
Oh, my!
Perfect.
Thanks for waiting.
She's eating with her friends.
I'm sorry, but this table is full.
Hey, you. Leaving just like that?
You're after Itsuki-chan, aren't you?
I'm not after her.
What? So it is Itsuki-chan?
What was it about her that got you?
How proper she is? You do seem like you'd be into that.
I know, I'll go get her.
Wait.
I don't need your help.
My problems are my own to figure out.
That's pretty manly, coming from a studyholic.
You can come to your Big Sis Ichika if you ever need help.
I bet this is going to be fun.
Big Sis? What?
We're in the same year.
I think.
This is bad, though.
I'm meeting her as her tutor today, after school.
Uesugi-san.
I must fix this by then.
Uesugi-san!
Uesugi-san!
You finally looked up.
Wh-Wh-Who are you?
Wh-Why do you know my name?
That's an excellent question.
Did you happen to lose an exam paper with a perfect score?
Or was it this one with a zero?
My exam paper? Why do you have it?
Well, you see...
Back then,
that happened,
I noticed...
And now, here we are.
So, which one is it?
The right.
Wow, you're so honest.
I shall grant you both.
I don't need it.
And who even scored a zero?
I did.
And you felt like giving it to me?
My first impression of you was that you're a gloomy loner,
but I'll also add genius to that.
That was fast.
Will you stop following me?!
You still haven't thanked me.
When someone picks something up for you, you say thank you.
How could you not know this? Aren't you a genius?
I happened to find this.
Now we're even.
Ah.
Thank you.
She actually went and thanked me.
I thought she'd be alone on her way home.
Ohtagawa
I think you're eating too much, Itsuki.
Am I?
This is still my second one.
You meat bun monster!
S-Stop it!
You won't be popular with guys!
None of your business!
I can't get a chance to apologize.
Are you having fun by yourself?
I-It's not bad.
This is my hobby.
I see.
Staring at high school girls is your hobby?
Calling in support.
Please don't report me.
Also, don't tell your friend Itsuki-chan.
Fine.
But...
She's not my friend.
I-Is this the place?
She's legit rich.
This is the right address, I think.
What are you, a stalker?
You can talk to me if you want something.
I won't get anywhere asking you two.
You're so persistent.
People don't like you, do they?
Go home already.
Go home?
But this is where I live.
R-Really?
Sorry!
Barbecue beef without barbecue.
Are you on a diet?
You!
I knew it!
There she is.
This is my last chance to talk to her.
Please don't close on me!
This is all her fault!
That I have to bear the discomfort of having to suck up...
That I have to be drenched in sweat on my way home from school...
That those weirdos keep messing with me...
It's all...
It's all her...
I-It's you.
What is it?
Do you need something from me?
A-About yesterday...
Huh? Say what?
What are you doing here, anyway?
About yesterday, uh...
I-I'm...
Are we done here?
No, wait.
What exactly are you trying to do?
I have a tutor coming soon.
That's me.
What?
I'm the tutor.
Ack!
Ack!
I-I absolutely refuse!
I don't like it, either.
I like this less than you do.
But...
I can't give up, either.
I was completely in the wrong yesterday.
I apologize.
Going forward, I'm your partner.
No... I can't.
This guy is our tutor?
Our?
That dude in front of our condo was so creepy.
That sounds bad.
Hey, it's the honor roll kid.
It's him! The stalker!
Uesugi-san is a stalker?!
You're getting ahead of yourself.
Wh-Why are they...
Because we live here, obviously.
So the five of you school friends share an apartment, huh?
My brain, having been put under a sudden, heavy load
and overclocked past its manufacturer limit, reached a certain conclusion.
I must be dreaming.
This has to be a dream.
No, actually.
We're...
quintuplets.
I'm Uesugi Futaro, and I'm going to be your tutor starting today.
I hope we can all have fun studying...
Why?
Why is there no one here?!
Here! Here!
I'm here!
Um...
Yotsuba, was it? The one who got a zero?
Could you try furrowing your eyebrows?
L-Like this?
You really are quintuplets, huh?
And why are you here?
For your lessons, obviously.
Yotsuba...
Can I hug you?
Okay, let's go get the rest of them!
Our rooms, from the front, are...
Itsuki, me, and then Miku, Nino, and Ichika.
I have to start by gathering the five of you?
It'll be fine.
Itsuki is quite studious.
She'll help us out, unless you really upset her.
No way.
Why you? You're in my class.
Is there not even one proper tutor in this town?
Come on, you said you wanted me to help you study yesterday.
It was a lapse in judgment.
Forget about it.
With five of us here, there's bound to be one who's like that.
Miku's the smartest of all of us.
She might get along with you.
No.
Why you? You're in our grade.
Is there not even one...
Say no more. I heard that already.
Sh-Shall we move on?
Nino's really good at socializing.
I bet she'll hit it off with you.
M-Maybe she's not in.
D-Don't worry!
We still have Ichika!
Ichika is...
Why the silence?
Please stay calm, okay?
Wh-What's with this room?
Is someone really living in this dump?
I wish you wouldn't talk about my room like it's some uncivilized land.
Jeez, you made a huge mess again.
I never thought you'd be our tutor.
So that's why you were after Itsuki-chan.
Never mind that.
We're going to the living room.
Wait, no! Don't do that!
I feel shy. I'm not wearing any clothes.
Wh-Why not?!
Yotsuba,
could you grab me some clothes from around there?
Huh? Let me see...
When's the last time she studied at this desk?
Come on, study this, study that...
You're in a girl's room. Is that really what you want to focus on?
Found one.
Just get changed and come to the living room, please.
Damn it.
Futaro, was it?
I need to ask you something.
Part of my gym clothes is missing.
A red sweatshirt.
I see.
I haven't seen it.
It was here a minute ago.
Until you got here.
You...
Didn't take it!
Hey.
I made too many cookies.
Want some?
Nakano Mi
There, now I have four of you.
Okay, let's start studying.
Yum!
What flavor are these?
Why are you wearing my sweatshirt?
I didn't want to get dirty baking.
Take it off now.
Hey, stop that!
Give it back.
Later! I'll give it back later!
Not to worry, Uesugi-san.
I'm studying.
Hey, let's go hang out somewhere. It's Saturday.
Oh, was there a package for me?
These girls are hopeless.
Do you not like cookies?
No, I'm just not in the mood for them.
You don't need to be so wary. I didn't poison the cookies.
I wouldn't mind studying if you have some.
He's going at them.
Are they good?
Yeah, they're good.
I'm so glad.
Oh, right. The thing is...
We don't need a tutor, honestly.
Just kidding.
Here, water.
Th-Thanks.
Damn it...
I'm not surprised by the way they're reacting,
but I need to get them to graduate.
There's no other way for me.
Bye-bye.
Sir.
Sir, we're here.
Where am I?
Where?
This is where you live, is it not?
H-How?!
She did this!
That'll be 4,800 yen.
Money?!
That's so much!
By card.
Thank you.
Itsuki.
I checked your student handbook for your address.
D-Did you look at the photo?
What are you talking about?
Anyway, they really pulled a fast one on you, huh?
If you've learned your lesson, you'll give up on tutoring us.
I can't do that.
Why are you so persistent?
I knew it was you, Onii-chan.
Raiha.
Dinner's...
Is this your student?!
Sh-She's nobody.
Let's go.
You're lying.
Would you like to have dinner at our place?
R-Raiha...
But...
Do you not want to?
Here we go.
The Uesugi Family's special curry and rolled egg.
I hope you like it.
It looks delicious.
I doubt a rich girl can appreciate the food of us common folk.
Hey!
Ow!
Cut that out.
That's why you aren't as popular as I am.
Dad...
I never thought you'd bring home a girl, though.
Let's eat.
Oh, yeah, Onii-chan.
Did you get your tutoring done?
About that...
O-Of course. It's all good.
Wh-What?!
Just play along. You'll make Raiha sad.
What's wrong?
No, it's nothing.
Y-Yes.
I'm glad, though.
We can finally deal with our debt problem.
We have a guest, Raiha.
Oh, sorry.
Thank you for having me.
Sure.
Thanks for the dinner, Raiha-chan.
Itsuki-san...
Y-Yes?
My brother's a crappy, egoistic low-life, but...
R-Raiha?
But he's got lots of good qualities, too.
So, um...
Would you have dinner with us again?
Of course.
Using my brain makes me hungry.
I hope you'll treat me again.
Don't get the wrong idea.
I have an idea of your circumstances now,
but I can't help you.
That so?
I'll study, but I won't ask for your tutelage.
I'll pull it off without your assistance.
So if you want to tutor us, suit yourself.
What did you just say?
I said, suit yourself.
R-Really?
That's all I have to do?
You're the best, Itsuki!
What?
I'll be there precisely at noon tomorrow.
Gather the other four for me.
Right.
That's right.
My job is to help all five of them graduate.
I don't need to actually deal with all five of them.
I just need to teach the ones that are in danger of failing.
I wonder if Futaro knows.
I doubt he knows...
that we transferred here because all five of us nearly failed.
The unbelievable day... Hehe.
You mean the day you met us, right?
It didn't seem like it at the time.
Yeah, you're right.
All these years later, I still relive that moment in my sleep...
It was unbelievable.
An absolute nightmare.
Next Time on The Quintessential Quintuplets
Quintuplets Trivia!
Our weights total up to 250 kilos!
Wow, it's neatly divisible by five!
50 kilos each! The average, healthy weight for a girl!
Let's go with that, okay?
Uh, but...
Let's go with that, okay?
Okay...
