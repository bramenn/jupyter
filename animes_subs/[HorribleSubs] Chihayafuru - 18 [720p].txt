during my forlorn years in this world
Saitama Hundred Poets Tournament
We appreciate all your help, Mrs. Oe.
Please! Call me Rieko!
Kana-chan, do we really have to wear hakama for every tournament?
Of course!
It's a Mizusawa High School Karuta Club tradition.
What?
In that case,
I should probably learn how to put one on by myself.
Desktomu-kun!
Oe Traditional Clothing
offers lessons for wearing hakama!
Oe Traditional Clothing offers a new line
of cotton hakama for competitive karuta!
Er, u-uh...
This will be my first official match after making Class A
that isn't limited to high schoolers.
First, you need to win!
After that, your goal is to win the whole thing so you can advance in rank!
Let's get serious!
Yeah!
Mashima, you're fired up.
So am I.
Me too!
Are you nervous, Chihaya-chan?
Shouldn't you be used to playing in tournaments?
K-Kana-chan, I feel like
a rookie out of high school in his first major league game!
Huh?
Class A is completely different from the lower classes.
to play in a Class A tournament.
Chihaya Furu
Verse 18
The Plum Blossoms Still Smell the Same
My first Class A match...
Chihaya-chan, stop taking cards with your speed.
This will lead me to the Queen...
but I need to win my first match.
Oh, that's a pretty hakama.
Huh?
I love how colorful your hakama is.
Thank you very much...
If I were a little younger,
I would love to wear a colorful hakama.
Y-You look adorable!
I know.
She knows. Oh...
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
My opponent in the first round.
Kanai Sakura-san.
I can't let my nerves get the better of me.
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Stay calm.
Today, my goal is to not move too fast
and not make faults.
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
Play a balanced style that allows me to take
cards from both sides of the opponent's field.
When I must hide these burning feelings,
I screwed up! I totally screwed up!
Wow, you're so fast.
Young people have such excellent reflexes.
I can't keep up.
I feel as though my body is on fire with Ibuki mugwort
Though my hatred...
Ah! That's the wrong card! A fault!
Wow,
you really have fast reflexes.
People with fast reflexes tend to mix up
similar-sounding first syllables.
Lucky me.
I see.
She's right.
Fast reflexes and sharp ears can be powerful tools,
but they can also cause mistakes.
Stop concentrating on speed.
That's why Dr. Harada told me to stop.
While it pains me...
Lucky me!
The tail feathers of...
Lucky me!
I wish I could show...
Lucky me!
You let me take another card.
and I have yet to visit Amanohashidate or read my mother's letters
I'm having trouble attacking her...
Why?
Lucky me!
I get to play a girl who only has speed.
Why did she have to say that?
My goal today was to not move too fast.
have been soaked red with tears of blood
Would this old palace courtyard...
A dead card!
be as dear now, those were the good old days
Since I could not hide my love,
Dead card!
Impassioned vows exchanged...
Again?
Look for the sound...
Another dead card!
I know that my heart...
Five dead cards in a row.
and by no fault of mine
Nobody wishes to see the beautiful cherry blossoms
The next card has to be one in play.
The next card...
The next card...
I really want to move!
covered by the smoky mountain fog
So the flower has wilted during
Seven dead cards in a row!
the long spring rains, just as my beauty has faded
A fault...
You couldn't hold yourself back, huh?
Lucky me.
Then I'll send you
the red that is the Tatsuta River
this card.
She sent me the Impassionate gods card...
I can do this!
I'm gonna take the next card.
While it brings me no joy...
Take the next card!
Take the next card!
I'm in luck again.
I should have been able to take that card.
If I'd been ready to move back from
While it may to While it brings...
I have faster reflexes!
Stay calm...
This may be my first Class A match,
but I can't lose!
If I'm not the strongest female Class A player,
I don't even get to challenge the Queen!
If I lose here, I can never take on Shinobu-chan!
This is no fun.
Huh?
Ayase-san, it feels like you're only playing against the cards.
it is as though pearls have been strung across the autumn plain
She sent me Since the, which is a
one-syllable card now because
Since I could not hide has been read.
I was hoping to take that card from her...
She's so hard to play against...
She's making it hard for me to play against her?
Right, she also sent Impassionate.
The opponent's right side doesn't have many cards left.
Her cards are positioned to prevent me from
using my speed effectively.
Wow, you really have fast reflexes.
Ayase-san, it feels like you're only playing against the cards.
She addresses me by name
and watches how I play.
Vs. Ayase Ayase Komano 1) The Impassionate card in my right middle row is taken by Ayase. She sends The sound of people from her right lower row to my right lower row. 2) I take In order to from her right middle row. In order for is on my side and Ayase was focused on taking that card from me. I send I feel as from my right middle side to her right middle side.
But you have trouble with three-syllable cards,
so I would place those cards in
region B and constantly attack them.
I'm sure you'll come up against people
who use these strategies.
Excuse me.
I have a habit of going for every card
as though it were a one-syllable card.
That's why I end up using too much force.
In that case, I should move back my start line.
Just a little bit.
Find the position that
lets me take the lead at the goal line!
Oh, she moved back?
She was on the edge of the boundary before.
Ten centimeters?
No, she moved back fifteen centimeters.
Can she still reach the cards?
She must have a plan. I love it!
Youth is a wonderful thing!
Said night was young when the false rooster's crow
Whoa! A dead card!
That was close.
But I can reach the farthest row on both sides.
Her arm is so long.
She can easily reach any spot on the field.
If she finds her rhythm...
I'm moving a card.
Huh?
She moved Said bed as soon
as it became a one-syllable card!
Keep worrying your pretty little head.
So innocent and cute!
I feel as though I am...
Lucky me.
The emotions experienced...
I have to take the cards that are there for me.
The cards that are there for her?
Is this all part of her plan?!
She finally noticed...
Her karuta has something that mine lacks.
I need to watch her play.
Figure out what Sakura-san has that I don't.
The way she's been watching me play.
banish any lingering memories of the past
My fear is not of...
Oh.
We used the same three-syllable timing to take the card,
But since we touched it at the same time,
it's mine.
Three-syllable timing...
Timing...
Timing!
There's another way to play karuta!
A way that doesn't rely on speed!
The way Sakura-san plays!
In order for us to find our way home,
Thank you very much.
I lost by six cards...
Kanai Sakura-san!
Oh!
Yes?
Th-They're adorable!
I know.
So she knows. Oh...
Thank you very much for your help today!
I'll do my best to become a player that doesn't rely on speed!
I want to become Queen!
Oh, dear. So do I.
Huh?
Does it sound strange coming from
an old lady who's been playing karuta for 35 years?
35 years?!
20 years ago, I was much cuter
and considered a karuta idol like you.
Not a karuta idol
Not a karuta idol
I've never won any major tournaments,
and no matter how hard I try,
I keep losing to younger players.
But I love karuta.
I still dream about becoming Queen.
What? Then I also want to become Queen!
Me too!
Oh? That makes us rivals then.
I'll see you at the East qualifier.
And so, I had just lost my first Class A match,
yet I had no idea that I was
about to experience the worst moment of my life.
The Class B final is between Taichi and Porky!
The Class D final is between
Desktomu-kun and Kana-chan!
The other four members of the Mizusawa karuta club
trumped their captain by reaching the finals!
Wh-Who do I...
Which match do I watch?!
Who do I root for?!
What should I do as their captain?!
Retro-kun!
Y-You were in this tournament.
How did you do?
I didn't do anything!
I ran into Mashima in the first round
and lost by three cards...
I had all the momentum!
This is what it means to win the battle, but lose the war!
What about the other Hokuo members?
Amakasu-senpai and the others already left.
I lost, so I'm leaving.
I'm going to take whatever I can from the winners!
Next month is the East Master qualifier.
This may be my last chance to advance in rank.
I have to win here!
I bet that's what Mashima's thinking right now.
I'm not too interested in the Master final,
but I can't let Mashima beat me!
I admire Kana-chan.
Her elegant playing style, her tenacity...
and she has the stats to show for it.
She averages 0.6 faults a match.
During practice, she comes back to win 74 of the time.
Due to her size,
she rarely goes on the attack.
Her personality makes her more defense-minded.
Gulp.
I know Kana-chan!
I can beat her!
Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter
Everybody's playing against
each other for a chance to advance in rank.
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
This will never happen again.
I have to serve as their witness!
Here comes spring, now the flower blooms
The emotions experienced...
Huh? What?
My life means nothing...
What? What?!
This is impossible!
I have no idea what's going on in either match!
Who got that card?! Who got it?!
Can you calm down?
I want to watch them play!
Huh? Kana-chan...
She isn't sitting back the way she does in practice.
Has her exercise paid off?
I will not cast myself into Naniwa Bay,
But she just started...
Is it because of the hakama?!
but I will risk my life to see you again
As my love first came to realization,
Excuse me.
Oh!
Now that I think about it,
this is the first time I've watched Kana-chan
play in a hakama.
When wearing a kimono,
you must maintain proper posture
and suck your stomach in,
as though you have a board running down your spine.
My obi helps to support me.
All alone, I step outside my house seeking comfort,
It helps to strengthen my center!
How lovely.
Kimonos are so beautiful.
She's so pretty.
Chihaya-chan is very beautiful,
but she's beautiful no matter what she wears.
Kanade isn't necessarily beautiful,
but she knows how to use a kimono.
She is the true poster girl for Oe Traditional Clothing!
Kana-chan attacks better when she's wearing a hakama.
She can play 100 when she's wearing a hakama.
I practice with her every day,
and I can still learn new things
about her in a real match.
Still, the normal Kana-chan is there.
There is one card that I can always take against Kana-chan.
While it brings me no joy...
It's quite simple.
Ayase cares about the Impassionate card,
and similarly, Kana-chan believes that the
While it brings card belongs to her,
and I have yet to visit Amanohashidate or read my mother's letters
because her name is Oe.
Plus...
Whenever While it brings is read,
her attention is drawn to The storm will.
The autumn paddy shacks...
Which delays her response to the other cards.
Because Lady Izumi Shikibu and Koshikibu no Naishi
Daughter
Koshikibu no Naishi While it brings me no joy, the road beyond Mount Oe is too long and I have yet to visit Amanohashidate or read my mother's letters
Mother
Lady Izumi Shikibu The storm will soon carry me to the afterlife, so I wish for a memory of you to take with me
were mother and daughter.
Desktomu-kun is really calm.
He understands Kana-chan's karuta.
Kana-chan doesn't recognize cards just by syllables
the way other players do.
Ariwara no Narihira Impassionate gods have never seen the red that is the Tatsuta River
Brothers
Ariwara no Yukihira Note that though we may be apart, if I am to hear that you pine for me as the Inaba mountain pines, I shall return to you
When Ariwara no Narihira's card is read,
she looks for his brother, Yukihira.
Lady Sei Shonagon Said night was young when the false rooster's crow but the gates of Afusaka remained shut
Father and Daughter
When Lady Sei Shonagon is read,
Kiyohara no Motosuke Impassioned vows exchanged over many a tear shed to last until the day waves crash over Mount Suenomatsu
Rivals
she looks for Kiyohara no Motosuke,
Lady Murasaki Shikibu Long last we meet, only for me to leave hurriedly, for I could not recognize you, like the moon hidden behind the clouds
as well as Lady Murasaki Shibu.
Kana-chan values the meaning
and history behind every card,
but the syllables are what matter in competitive karuta.
As I wait for someone...
I screwed up!
A fault!
I have trouble differentiating between As I and As this.
My focus is on the syllables,
but my hearing isn't as good as Ayase's!
Desktomu-kun reacted as soon as As was read.
Which card will Kana-chan send?
Huh?
I can look up and see the snowy cap of Mt. Fuji
Kana-chan, why is No matter always
the first No card you send?
I would send Note that first,
since it sounds different from the others.
My hearing isn't as good as yours,
so Nobody, No more, No matter,
Note that, None are, and Nothing
are all difficult for me.
But the bigger something is, the easier it is to notice.
No matter where I stand on the shores of Tago,
I can look up and see the snowy cap of Mt. Fuji
She's drawn to the image
of Mt. Fuji!
No matter where I stand on the shores of Tago,
I didn't hear a thing.
Her motion was flawless.
Straight as an arrow...
I'm not here to cheer them on.
I'm not here as their captain.
I'm going to take whatever I can from them!
Meanwhile, there was another intense match going on,
but only Retro-kun was watching!
