Last time, Magikarp evolved into Gyarados
and our heroes were swallowed up in the deadly power of its dragon rage.
Hey, Brock! Misty! Pikachu! Whatever happens, don't let go!
Pika!
Talk about twists of fate. Round and round they go.
Where they'll stop, even I don't know.
Huh? How did I get on a beach?
Oh, Misty! Misty, get up!
-Hey, Brock! -
-How did we get here? -How did we survive that cyclone?
Hey, we were lucky. But where did Pikachu go?
I only have two of my Pokemon.
-Could it be...? -Does this mean...?
We survived again!
We're the completely invincible...
-Unbeatable... - Team Rocket!
Huh?
-But I don't hear any annoying... -Complaining.
Meowth is missing.
Oh! I've lost the Poke Ball with the Ekans I got for my birthday last year!
Oh! The Poke Ball with the Koffing I got for Christmas is gone, too.
And we're totally broke.
We're penniless and Poke-less. How will we survive?
Time is running out for the both of us.
- We could always call for help. -Huh?
- Look over there. -A phone booth.
Aren't we lucky?
Now we can call someone for help.
-But we don't have any change. -And without any change...
Our luck sure has changed.
Char.
Squirtle.
Pika.
-Pika pi? -Char.
-Pi. -Char.
Squirt, squirt, squirt.
So, Pikachu and his friends survived?
All right, Pokemon, surrender.
-Squirt? -Char?
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light.
Surrender now or prepare to fight!
I guess the Team Rocket motto is starting to lose its impact.
Never mind!
Okay, guys, go get them!
Huh?
Hey!
I said go get them.
What?
Mm-hmm.
Right.
Masters? I'm twice as smart as those
two-watt light bulbs you're calling masters.
Come on, we're all bad guys here.
We don't need masters to tell us to go out and do bad stuff.
There's no such thing as a bad Pokemon?
It can't be!
My master's not around, and I always seem to act like a rat.
This ain't fair. You got me outnumbered.
Hey, I could use a little help over here!
It's no use.
Oh, well, I guess I'll let you guys off easy
and call it a draw.
- Hey, guys! -Char?
Ain't you ever going to stop stuffing your faces
and give Meowth something to eat?
I don't apologize!
Stop making fun of me!
Untie me and give me something to eat! Huh?
Squirtle?
-Squirtle! -Pika!
That's one big Pokemon.
Wait! Somebody come and untie me!
Huh?
I could've gotten out myself.
I've never seen a flying Pokemon like that before.
Ah, me neither.
It's one of the most incredible Pokemon I've ever seen.
Ash, this place is really dangerous.
We really ought to try to find a safe spot to crash for the night.
Right.
Be careful, Pikachu. All of you.
Just stick together.
-What is that thing? -I don't want to stop to find out!
Good thing we hid behind this sign.
Yeah, maybe our luck is changing.
- - It's a good sign.
-Koffing. Koffing. -
-Pika, pika, pika. Pika, pika. -Koffing...
Pika, pika. Pika pi.
-Bulba. Bulba. Bulbasaur. -Squirtle, Squirtle, Squirtle.
-Ekans. -Pika, pika.
-Bulbasaur. -Koffing. Koffing.
Koffing.
Char. Charmander.
Koffing.
Pika, pika. Pika, pika, pika.
Squirtle, Squirtle. Squirtle, Squirtle, Squirtle.
- -Char.
Koffing.
-Pi. -
Let's go. We got to find Pikachu and the others.
- -Sun's up.
-It's morning. - That means...
we'd better run for cover.
Uh, pardon me, but where are we running?
-To make a phone call. -Huh?
But, Jessie, we don't have any money.
There's one number we can always call for free.
Huh?
Hello, operator, I'd like to put this call through collect, please.
Who'd accept the charges?
-Hello, boss? - The boss?
You fools had better have a very good reason
for calling me this early in the morning.
Yes, but first, we must do the introduction.
-What? -Prepare for trouble.
Yes, and make it double.
To protect the world from devastation.
To unite all peoples within our nation.
To denounce the evils of truth and love.
To extend our reach to the stars above.
-Jessie. -James.
Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light!
Surrender now or prepare to fight.
Nitwits! How dare you annoy me with your nonsense.
Don't ever bother me like this again.
Well, I suppose we'll have to get off this island ourselves.
-The phone didn't help. -But it will.
But where will this telephone cable lead us?
It must lead to the phone company. The people there
-can help us get off the island. -Good point.
And if we stay inside this booth the whole way, we'll be safe.
-Pikachu! -Squirtle!
Charmander! Bulbasaur!
Oh, where could they all have gone?
Jessie, hauling this phone booth is exhausting.
Well, you could use a good workout.
- Huh? - Is that a mirage?
Pikachu doesn't even see us.
So we'll have no trouble catching it.
Come to us, Pikachu.
It is a mirage.
A really big mirage.
It's Big-achu!
Let's get out of here!
It looks like a Charizard.
An evolved Charmander?
But much bigger.
This is Squirtle's evolved form, a Blastoise.
Squirtle.
That's a Venusaur, evolved from a Bulbasaur.
-This is a nightmare. -Well, I hope we wake up soon.
There's a railcar. Let's hop in and make a run for it.
-Hurry! Let's go! -
-Huh? -Don't tell me we're...
Going back the way we came!
Jessie, we've got to do something.
-Let's hit the brake and run for it. -Right.
-One. -Two.
Three! Pull!
Huh?
Runaway train!
- -Pikachu!
Pikachu?
-Jumbo-sized. -
I wonder what that is.
Now we've got you just where we want you.
Hand over Pikachu. Huh?
- - But not that big one.
- Ash, look. Back there. -
-Pikachu! -
Pika pi!
Squirtle! Charmander! Bulbasaur!
They'll all be trampled if you don't do something.
Stop the car right now!
- -We can't do that.
We can't stop. The brake's broken.
Give me a break.
-We've just got to help them. -Huh?
-Ash, up ahead. -Huh?
What is it?
-Prepare for big trouble. -Make it double.
And I can't stand roller coasters!
-What do we do? -Hold on tight!
Stop the ride! Stop the ride! I want to get off!
-Whoa! -
We're going to crash!
-Come on, jump in! -Pika!
-Pika! -
-Are you okay? -Pikachu.
Wow, we made it. Is everybody here?
-Aren't we missing someone? -The furriest member of our team.
-You mean Meowth? -
-You're safe. -How did you make it?
I catapulted.
They're after us! Maybe our luck will hold out!
Well, based on our recent run of luck, I would say the cable should snap.
That should happen about now.
- -Next, we'll be hurled into the air.
Then we'll probably crash into something.
That's weird. Looks like that was a mechanical Pokemon.
-And then, finally... -We hit the water.
After a very, very long drop!
Here, you'll see various Pokemon at over ten times their natural size.
Of course, the Pokemon are all mechanical,
So don't worry, it's very safe.
Now, if you'll look to your left...
We apologize, ladies and gentlemen,
but our giant Pokemon are temporarily out of order.
Yes. What?
Pokemon land has been totally destroyed?
I spent millions on that place.
Finally, our tired heroes resume their long journey.
Huh? Ah!
And arrive at the beautiful town of Porta Vista.
-All right! - The beach!
- I can't wait! -
Ah, yes, blue skies and white sands.
Time to hit the surf and soak up some rays.
Don't forget to use lots of sunscreen, Ash.
Slowpoke.
Slowpoke slow.
Ah, Slowbro.
