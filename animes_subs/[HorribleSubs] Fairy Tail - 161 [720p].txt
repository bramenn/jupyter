Pathetic!
Fairy Tail used to be on top! What the hell happened?! Every last one of them...
Big words from somebody who was too busy pubhopping to cheer her teammates on.
I was watching you!
Even all the pubs have Lacrima Vision.
Well, let's raise a mug to our crushing defeat!
Oh, Master!
What a disaster of a day...
I know...
We'd all better get our act together from tomorrow.
I'm up tomorrow!
And I'll turn things around for us, you'll see!
Do it to it, Natsu!
If the Salamander's gonna be in the game, maybe I'll join in, too...
I'd say it's high time you showed'em the results of your training.
Huh? Lu-chan and Gray aren't here?
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen'em...
I'm not surprised, the way they lost...
They probably don't wanna be seen right now.
I don't know about that. Both of them were cool in my eyes.
Gray-sama...
Are you still depressed?
I could say the same thing to you.
I hear everybody's gathered at a nearby pub.
It's a pain in the ass, but I'm gonna at least pop in...
Don't leave me alone...
Lucy...
You...
Gray, the truth is I...
Don't! I've got Juvia...
I love you, Gray!
What'll I do if that happens?!
It's not happening...
As always, you've got a fertile imagination.
And this time, it was long!
Lu-chan, are you okay?
I'm totally fine. In fact, this has pumped me up even more!
Where are Wendy and Carla?
Looks like they're still under the weather...
Poluchka-san is with them.
Alright! We're all here, yeah?
Listen up, brats!
Today's defeat is the seed for tomorrow's victory!
Let's rise up!
'Cause we don't know the meaning of the words give up!
Aim for number one in Fiore!
Yeah!
Is that really the guild that was shut out today?
You tell me...
Chariot!
Your Majesty...
The first day of the Grand Magic Games has come to a successful end.
Yes, there were some fine magic battles.
I have come to ask if you have any requests for the second day's battle part.
Let's see... I'd like to see Bacchus.
Would you slot him in?
Against which team?
Fairy Tale's, um...
The shapeshifter.
I can't remember his name.
L something...
Certainly.
I'll arrange it.
I'm sure it'll make a rousing match.
If there's nothing else, then I shall take my leave...
Thank you for your trouble, Captain of the Guard. Have a good rest.
I don't have time to rest, Your Majesty.
Now when it's so close to completion...
Who's next?!
Come on, let's cheer up with a little throwdown!
Yeah, Natsu!
You're a wimp, Max!
How'd he get this strong in just three months?!
Where does that leave us?
Looks like fun. I'll take you up on that.
Don't.
Once you and Natsu get started, it's not gonna be a game.
Hey, your head's really gotten rounder, Laxus!
Stop it, Gajeel!
B-Bastard!
How dare you do that to Laxus?!
Right now, our pride is being trampled!
Laxus's Raijinshuu, assemble!
I can't...
Pathetic...
You're a strong drinker, huh, doll?
Why don't we see who's stronger?
I don't know who you are,
but you're challenging me to a drinking match?
Hey! I don't know who you are, but don't do it!
Don't let her looks fool you, that woman's a monster!
I don't believe it!
Is this for real?!
Someone drank Cana under the table?!
This is the first time I've seen Cana flat on the floor like that!
I'm takin' this as a trophy.
What the hell are you doin'?!
Gildarts will murder you!
Give it back!
You mess with our guild...
What is that guy?!
Dad!
Bacchus?
Yo! If it ain't Erza!
You reek.
You're a fine babe as always.
It's been a long time.
You know him?!
I hear you were gone for seven years?
True enough...
It seems you're not participating in the Grand Magic Games...
Well, I thought I'd leave it to the young'uns this time,
but after watching War Cry's pitiful match,
my man's soul couldn't stay silent!
So under the reserve member provision, I joined the team.
My soul is trembling with excitement.
If we get to clash tomorrow or after,
I'd like to settle things from that one time.
My soul is always...
I was hopin' for a little more than that, Erza!
What's his deal?!
He's an S Class wizard from Quatro Cerberus.
We used to run into each other a lot while out on jobs.
I know his strength very well.
The Drunk Falcon...
Drunken Bursting Palm Bacchus.
We've fought several times, but never to a decisive conclusion.
He's as strong as you, Erza?!
What, that was a long time ago!
There's no way he could beat Erza now!
You don't even know that Erza's gonna fight!
I could take him on, too...
What did you see?
Like always, it was just fragments, but I saw...
A white knight...
A giant magic circle...
Anything else?
A sight that I couldn't believe...
What was it?
Mercurius collapsing...
It was Lucy...
And now, what you've all been waiting for, the second day of the Grand Magic Games has begun!
Our guest on this second day is renowned reporter for the Weekly Sorcerer, Jason-san!
Cool!
Okay, the competition part has already begun!
And its name is... Chariot!
This competition takes place on top of a line of vehicles,
with the idea being to reach the goal without falling off!
As the vehicles are always moving,
just one moment of carelessness could lead to a misstep!
The vehicles will wend their way around the sightseeing spots of Crocus,
but which team will arrive here at Domus Flau?!
Everyone in the stadium, you can watch the race here on Lacrima Vision!
Cool!
At any rate, Yajima-san,
who could have predicted this turn of events?!
Why did Natsu sign up for this?!
You'd think he would've been able to tell what kind of event it was from the name, Chariot!
Once he made up his mind to do it, he doesn't listen.
He probably thought he'd be fighting the chariots themselves...
Oh, my! Way in the rear
is a groggy-looking Natsu from Fairy Tail A!
This isn't gonna work...
And that's not all!
Right in front of him is Gajeel from Fairy Tail B
and even Sting from Sabertooth, all moving like molasses!
W-What's wrong with me?!
What's going on here, Yajima-san?
I suppose the three of them have something in common.
Motion sickness...
That's the Salamander's thing...
What's going on?! Why is Gajeel like that?!
Don't swipe Natsu's character!
And a member of Saber, too...
This doesn't look good...
I never thought the invincible Sting-kun's one weakness would be revealed...
Fro thinks so, too!
Alright, let's check in with the leaders of the pack!
It's a fierce dead heat at the front!
In the lead is Blacksnake of Raven Tail!
Ichiya of Blue Pegasus is on his heels,
followed by Yuuka of Lamia Scale
and Risley of Mermaid Heel!
Men!
I'm surprised you can keep up with that body type!
Never underestimate a chubby girl!
Some distance behind them is Bacchus from the reserve squad of Quatro Cerberus!
I'm pooped...
Haven't thrown off the effects of last night's booze yet...
Wave Boost!
You can't use magic while you're in my shockwave!
Never underestimate a chubby girl!
There it is! Risley's gravity-altering!
She avoided the surge by running on the side of the vehicle!
A magic-negating wave... In that case...
Fleet-footed parfum! Zero distance inhalation!
Everybody's trying their best...
My soul is quivering...
Maybe I'll try a little harder, too!
W-What's this?!
Bacchus used his power to destroy the vehicles!
He's more powerful than he was seven years ago...
What's with this guy?!
See you later! If you fall, you're out!
What is that?!
That's playing dirty...
He's underestimating a chubby girl...
You're not chubby!
Gravity altering is cool!
And just like that, he crossed the goal line first!
It's quivering!
Quatro Cerberus wins 10 points!
Cerberus had a man like this...?!
Wild...
In second place, Blacksnake of Raven Tail!
In third, Risley! In fourth, Yuuka! In fifth, Ichiya!
All that's left are these three, battling it out at the bottom ranks!
I-I don't believe this...
I never had any problem with transportation before...
Well...
Congratulations to the...
Newbie...
Why, you...!
Can't muster any power...
Natsu!
Gajeel!
Is this what he meant by making it fun?
He's not trying to be funny, right, Rogue?
Dragon Slayers get motion sick on vehicles...
I thought it was just Sting and me...
Maybe Laxus, too...?
Don't tell anybody.
I think it's obvious by this point.
Move...
Lame...
You're totally serious
even though you can't draw on any power...
Go ahead.
I'll give this match to you.
After this one, we're gonna keep winning anyway.
We're not gonna miss one or two points.
Don't cry about that one point later, kid!
Would you answer me one thing?
Why did you decide to participate in the tournament?
I wouldn't believe you were the same Fairy Tail from back in the day.
Are you worried about the strength of your guild? About your public image?
The Fairy Tail that I know
were more like... They did everything at their own pace...
They didn't give a damn about what people thought of them.
For... their friends...
Seven years...
All that time...
No matter how painful it was...
No matter how sad...
Even if people made fun of'em...
They protected the guild...
And now we're gonna show everyone...
So keep on goin'!
Natsu...
Goal!
Natsu of Fairy Tail A, 2 points for being in sixth place!
I got our first points!
Gajeel of Fairy Tail B, 1 point for seventh place!
They're tenacious, I'll give'em that!
Yeah. Wow...
Who are those guys?!
Fairy Tail, huh? I kinda liked that...
I'm a little touched...
I think I might cheer them on...
Good going, Fairy Tail!
I'm gonna be rooting for you guys from now on!
And Sabertooth's Sting gets 0 points for dropping out!
For their friends?
What nonsense...
Alright, now Raven Tail is in first place!
Cool!
Sabertooth has dropped to second place!
Sabertooth is in second?!
I think it's Sting's fault...
Is Natsu okay?
There's nothing to worry about with him.
He just has motion sickness.
What about Wendy?
She's recovered a lot.
Are you back to normal, Carla?
Yes...
Well, thank goodness for that!
Everyone's waiting, so I'll be going.
You don't intend to say anything?
What good would telling her about that future do?
There's no way she would believe me.
When you don't believe it yourself,
certainly other people wouldn't believe it.
That's right! I don't believe that stuff!
It was just a dream!
It was a dream...
Not a premonition!
Okay, on to the much-anticipated battle part!
In the first match is Blacksnake of Raven Tail, a new guild that's currently the front runner,
versus Lamia Scale's Toby Horhorta!
It's a confrontation between snake and dog! Which will win?!
I hope we see a fair fight.
Toby is way dog! Cool!
Has the match started?!
It's just about to.
Looks like Leon and that dog-like guy are gonna be in it.
His opponent is from Raven.
Raven?
B-Blondie...
She's covered in bruises!
Flare...
Don't you ever disgrace us like that again.
Who do you think you owe your victory to?
But Blondie was glaring at me...
Would you like to be struck again?
I-I'm sorry. Please forgive me...
Super Paralysis Claw Mega Mega Jellyfish!
He disappeared!
Fool! It's Mimic Magic!
Sand Rebellion!
That's my magic!
So he can mimic the properties of anyone's magic!
Mimic... That's unusual magic.
Do your best, dog-like person!
Bust up Ivan's guild...
You're strong.
You're tough, too.
Blacksnake's a cool name!
It's not my real name...
It's not your real name?!
That ticks you off?
You! If I win, you're tellin' me your real name!
That's fine, but what if I win?
I'll tell you a secret about myself!
That sounds interesting.
Apparently, they've made a weird bet.
I'm not interested in learning either one, though...
Cool!
A bet?
I like the sound of that...
Why, you! C'mere! Fangface!
Damn you! C'mere!
A Man!
It's Elfman's turn!
And his opponent is Bacchus, huh?
That's the guy who's as strong as Erza!
And he blew everyone else away with that Chariot thing, too... Dammit!
But Elfman's a man who gets serious when he gets down to it!
And I'm curious about the results of his training, too!
Happy... Are you imitating the way that dog-guy talks?
Next time: Elfman vs. Bacchus!
I forgot my pride as a cat and imitated a dog!
What is your pride as a cat?
