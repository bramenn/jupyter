Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
Ah...
What's wrong?
Nothing. It's just that I feel so pathetic, looking like this.
I just want to go back to normal soon.
Do you? But Keiichi, I think you're quite lovely.
That's not the point, see...
As long as I'm looking like this, I can't even show myself outside.
I haven't been to class in 3 days now.
Keiichi...
Keiichi?
I'd like you to let me handle this.
Keiichi, sorry to keep you waiting! This will turn you back to normal!
What are you doing?
What do you think? You won't stand out in these clothes, no matter where you go!
I told you, that's not the point...
Oh? You mean you'd prefer a different style of clothes?
No, no...what I mean is...
There! No, no...what I mean is...
How sweet!
What is she doing?
Ah! What Wouldn't I Give for an Angel With White Wings?!
Thanks, I appreciate it. I'm so much more comfortable as a man.
Well, now you owe me big time, Keiichi.
But you're the one who made that potion, Urd!
But it was Skuld who made you take it.
Is that Belldandy singing?
Along with Holy Bell...
By the way, what exactly is an angel to a goddess?
Well, to put it simply, she's there for support.
There are some high-level magical spells that can't be cast without an angel.
Yeah?
And also, the angel is like a symbol for a goddess's soul and condition.
Oh, I see, when Belldandy got sick, it affected her angel, too.
Well, there you go.
Every full-fledged goddess has her own angel.
So then you have one, too, Urd. An angel?
Well, yes.
Big Sister!
Hello, Skuld.
That was so... that was so beautiful just now!
Your singing, and Holy Bell's too!
Thank you!
Big Sister...um...uh, you see...
What is it?
Well, the thing is...um...I...
I was thinking I'd like an angel, too!
What?
Because you're not a full-fledged goddess until you have your own angel, right?
I can't wait to be just like you, Big Sister, so...
I'm proud of you, Skuld!
Huh? I'm proud of you, Skuld!
You've found your sense of responsibility as a goddess!
Huh? Well, not exactly, but...
We'd better start your training at once!
Huh? We'd better start your training at once!
I just want to have an angel like you!
You've decided to take this seriously! I just want to have an angel like you!
I just want to have an angel like you!
As your older sister, I can't be happier. I just want to have an angel like you!
What shall we have you practice first?
I am the goddess of the Pillar that controls the workings of Heaven and Earth.
I bid you now in my name, release yourself from the chains of the earth...
There!
There! There! Come on!
No one has ever mastered this without some difficulty at first.
Don't worry. If you just keep working at it, I know you'll be able to do it.
I know!
Behold!
I'll use a Gravity Canceller Magnum!
You mustn't use a device like that! I'll use a Gravity Canceller Magnum!
I did it! That's what you wanted me to do, right, Big Sister?
Magic is a power that comes from within. You mustn't depend on outside sources.
But I'm not like you, Big Sister. I don't have any talent for magic.
But isn't that why we're practicing?
Urd! But isn't that why we're practicing?
Only those who have achieved their goals can talk about talent.
You haven't accomplished anything yet!
You shut up!
All I want is to have an angel like Big Sister!
It has nothing to do with whether or not I can use magic!
Oh yes it does.
Is that true, Big Sister?
Yes. To have an angel, you must first have enough power to support her.
That's why you must practice magic spells, to enhance your power.
Oh, is that right...
In other words, it's 100 years too soon for you to have an angel.
Start practicing more diligently!
Who do you think you are? Butting in and acting like some hotshot!
Well, I am a hotshot.
See that? It's a piece of cake!
Grr! Then what about yours, Urd?
My what?
Anyone who talks like such a hotshot must have the most amazing angel ever!
Urd...
You bet I do! You can't even imagine how magnificent this angel of mine is.
After all, I'm just way out of your league, you know...out of your league!
I hate you, Urd!
Skuld!
What a little baby she is, huh?
Urd!
It's all right.
Just make sure you get Skuld to understand something...
Urd!
Urd, are you there?
Huh?
Why don't we take a walk together?
All right. I guess I'll join you.
All right!
Well, hello!
Urd...
What is it?
Listen...
Yes?
The angel...
Urd!
How did you feel when you first got your angel?
Weren't you scared?
I know I was scared.
You're still thinking about that day...
I'm sorry I made you worry. You're still thinking about that day...
Urd!
She who is closest to me... who knows me better than anyone else.
She who is the mirror-image of my innermost soul.
That's right. Your angel is the reflection of your soul.
Your other self...
Come forth, angel!
Who am I kidding? Of course she wouldn't come out.
Aha! This is my chance!
I thought something was fishy... Urd doesn't have an angel either!
That means if I can manage to get an angel before Urd does...
Too cool...
That would rock... that would really, really rock!
All right, then...I'm going to start practicing my magic spells again!
Ta da!
With the help of my Virtual Simulator'Mr. Heartthrob' Model 156, I can...
Training should be conducted in a scientific way, after all.
Why do I have to take part in this too?
Don't worry.
This simulator isn't just for magic...it has a wide variety of applications.
I'm going to get my helmet back the way it was, right?
Stop whining. One has to make sacrifices in the name of scientific progress.
Switch on!
Darn, that's a wicked curve!
Oh man, I missed the corner! No, no...I'm not done yet!
I have yet to unleash my full power!
I'm the king of Nekomi Ridge!
My experiment was a success! Just look at the way Keiichi's acting.
At this rate, I'll be using magic in no time!
Just you wait, Urd.
I'm going to show you what I can do when I really put my mind to it!
I did it! I finally got it to levitate!
Okay. One more time!
Nothing's levitating...what in the world does she think she's doing?
Now that I think of it, was there a time when I was just like her?
I'm pleased to meet you, Big Sister.
I wished I could be just like her.
I'm remembering that day again.
Even though I know it's pointless, no matter how many times I look back.
What was it that Belldandy said that day?
Hey, I didn't realize how quiet it's become.
She's hopeless!
All she has to do is train hard, and she'll get to meet her angel...
Well, I guess I have no right to talk...
Why didn't I realize it sooner?
What's the point of casting virtual magic if I can't use it in the real world?
At this rate, I'm never going to be able to control an angel!
Hey, weren't you going to show me up big time?
It's just like I said... it's 100 years too soon for you!
Wait, that's it! It's the results that matter!
As long as I learn to use some kind of really amazing magic, anything goes!
This time around, I'm beyond serious!
I'm home.
I can't believe I was such a moron.
Why the heck did I run all the way up Nekomi Ridge for no reason?
Huh?
Uh-oh. So it finally died on me, huh?
Wait, don't tell me...
Well, you don't have to tell me who was behind this.
Done!
Now that I have this, I'm sure to get an angel before she does!
I see. So that's the reason, huh?
Oh, please. I was just borrowing it for a minute!
What's this gigantic thing?
Just listen and be struck with awe! Ta da!
Power Amp Alpha 707!
This device will amplify my powers...
Didn't Belldandy tell you to stick to training?
You be quiet!
I don't need steady training when I have the power of science at my fingertips.
Switch on!
Let's go, Alpha 707!
What's that?
Urd!
What's going on?
This is a high-level water spell... But...
Keiichi!
Don't worry, she's just unconscious.
I see. It's that device that's amplifying her power.
Keiichi, I'm going to open up the wall now!
It's no good. The wind-elemental spell isn't strong enough.
The only way to break through that wall of water is with a fire-elemental spell!
Urd...
No, I can't. Urd...
Urd!
I know you haven't been using your angel all this time...
But please, just this once!
It's not that I don't use her. I can't use her.
What?
Ever since I was a child, I've always suspected...
That's why I was a little scared when I swallowed the angel's egg.
But even so, deep down inside I expected it to happen...
But that's not what came to pass.
And when I was confronted with reality, I couldn't stop myself from screaming.
You heard me that day, didn't you?'Don't ever come out again!'
Don't ever come out again!
Urd...
Angels must always obey their goddesses...
Belldandy!
Keiichi?
There's something wrong with Skuld!
This is terrible! That device can only force power out.
If we don't do something, Skuld will lose all of her powers!
Urd!
I can't take back what I said. I'm the one who ordered my angel never to appear again.
Urd!
There's nothing I can do now.
Urd!
Believe in yourself, Urd. I know you'll be able to meet her.
I've seen that smile somewhere before.
Urd!
I'd forgotten, you see...
What? I'd forgotten, you see...
Why I wanted to have an angel.
That's right, I'd forgotten.
I'm pleased to meet you, Big Sister.
Because I wished I could be...
Like Belldandy!
No matter what you may look like, you are my other self.
Don't ever come out again!
Thank you, Belldandy...
You have such a lovely angel!
Come forth, World of Elegance!
We meet at last...
Consumed by fire!
I'm never going to let you go again. Never!
Skuld, I hope you get to meet yours soon, too.
An angel's egg...
I'm sure that day isn't far off...
Skuld!
Hey...hey! So you did have an angel, too, Urd!
Of course! Doesn't that annoy you? Look at us, look at us!
Urd! I don't think I can stand this!
Keiichi! Phone's ringing!
Come on, isn't anyone around?
Yes, hello?
What?
We're back. Huh? What's the matter, Urd?
Urd? What's the matter?
Hello? Oh...yes?
All right.
What's wrong?
Oh, um, that was the Almighty on the phone...
The Almighty?
He's suspending Urd's license as punishment for walking off the job the other day.
Goddesses can get their licenses suspended?
Yes. Goddesses can get their licenses suspended?
During the suspension period, you can't use your powers as a goddess.
Hey! Please don't go! My little angel!
I finally got to see you again!
So that's the deal, huh? I finally got to see you again!
I hate getting my license suspended!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a wing!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams. You have a wing!
I love you so much it hurts...
And it hurts me that I can't tell you how I feel.
You and I have matching hearts...
So we must share the same scars deep down inside.
But now that I'm in your arms, I think I can catch...
Nobody else matters... All we have to do is gaze at each other.
It's all right for your heart to flutter... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
Don't run away from happiness.
I'll always be waiting for you.
So come rest your wings anytime.
It's all right to cry... anytime you need to.
I just want to see you again... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
I just want you to be happy.
A pure white soul clashes with demon-black blood...
When that balance is broken, she is transformed into the Lord of Terror.
