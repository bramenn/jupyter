I'll sacrifice Passive Defense, Blinding Light, and Night Vision to create...
Sacrifice!
Wait, isn't that skill
I can do this!
You're mine!
Damn, you're fast!
Is that what you thought I'd say?
This isn't enough for me to... lose!
Wait...
Skills Skills Skills
Th-That sword... It has a lightning attribute?!
This is honestly a pain, so I'm going to end it now.
I win!
Master...
Noir...
Don't go dying on me.
Please be my master!
Please! I want to be your student!
200 Years Ago
Wow, that must've taken a lot of guts.
But that's such a pain...
Yeah, nah. Run along now. Shoo, shoo.
Please!
Aw, his cute, pristine face is going to get dirty.
But still...
I'm terrible at teaching.
Please reconsider!
I'll do my best, even if it kills me!
Nope. Not happening.
End of story.
Please make me your student!
Please!
Please!
Why are you so obsessed with this?
I promised my childhood friend, who passed away, that I'd become
the best adventurer in the world.
So I'm going to become the best adventurer in the world,
one whose name is known even to the heavens.
Okay, then. I'll give you a chance to be my student.
Attack me right now.
Huh?
You can use any means. If you give me so much as a scratch, you win.
Wait, in the middle of the city?
You want to be the best in the world, right?
Here I go!
You're terrible at lying, aren't you?
You hold your sword entirely too straight.
And...
Maybe it's none of my business,
but you should give up on becoming an adventurer.
The boy just refused to give up.
Day after day... Every single day.
Could you tell me about goblins?
Aw, but that's such a pain.
I'm sure even you'd be able to take down a goblin.
But be careful with iron goblins.
Their flesh is super hard, so go after their eyes instead.
I see!
Even after a month had passed, the boy showed up every day.
I never thought of that! You really are something, Master!
Seriously, stop calling me Master.
I'm pretty sure I won't be able to use that method,
so I'll just swing around my sword more.
Thanks for all your valuable advice today!
Maybe becoming an actual mentor might not be such a bad thing.
Barkeep, I'll take the usual.
Olivia, should you be here right now?
What do you mean?
Well, your student...
What are you talking about?
You haven't heard? Well, he...
My daughter was attacked by a monster, and he saved her.
By the time I had gotten back with the guards, it was too late.
The monster was the rare iron goblin.
He stabbed the monster's eye with his sword so my daughter could escape.
His pristine skin...
Such a beautiful face.
A face as sweet and calm as the moon.
What if I had taught him properly?
What if I had actually become his master and Bestowed skills upon him?
If I had chosen a different yesterday,
then a different tomorrow would have...
What awaited me after that was 200 years of being alone.
But then, one day...
U-Um... You are alive, right?
Noir, you looked remarkably like that boy.
I may have given you those skills just to make myself feel better.
It won't change the past, and the regrets remain.
But...
Noir, please... Let me see your smiling face again.
Master...
Damn it. My body still won't move.
The effects of Sacrifice are gone now, too.
Aw, aren't you going to plead for your life?
L-Like I'd ever do that!
Oh, really? In that case...
Bye-bye!
Run Like the Wind!
Ow! What's the big idea?
Leave Noir alone!
Emma, what are you...
I was looking for you.
I figured we could come up with a plan to face that fake together.
And...
You're one of my adventurers, Noir.
You're my precious partner.
I want to use these powers for others.
Noir is my rival and friend. I can't let him do this alone!
All right, everyone!
Let's do this together!
Yeah!
Oh? Look at all your cute little friends.
I appreciate the concern, but she's too powerful.
Everyone's grateful to you, Noir. You're always helping us out.
I became the top receptionist because of you, Noir.
I was all alone, and you let me join your party.
We captured those phantom thieves together!
So... at least let us repay you a little.
You doofus.
Everyone...
Well, aren't you popular, Noir? I'm so jealous!
She really...
Let's knock down...
Hey, you've got a gun?!
Demon Fist!
Wind Strike!
Emma!
I-I still haven't recovered?!
Is it because it was a skill attack?
Guess I'll have to teach you what happens when you butt in.
The one who's... going to defeat my rival in love...
is me!
Lola!
Yikes, talk about the strength of a gorilla.
Who're you calling a gorilla?!
L-Lola! If you do that too much, the bridge will
Oh, my. I lost my composure.
It's no use acting all meek and adorable now!
Luna! Please heal Emma and Lola!
Understood.
Touching that sword is bad news.
I'll have to use Editor and...
Destroy!
Hey, what's wrong?
Leila! Now!
I'm on it!
Demon Fist!
Yes!
Now I've got you!
That was a pretty fiery attack! Right back atcha!
I'm sorry, Noir...
Leila! We have to heal her quickly!
L-Luna!
Luna Heela
Temperature +5
I-Is she doing this?!
But when?
N-Noir... I'm sorry.
Luna!
And...
She did it to Emma, too! But when did she...
Temperature +5
Emma Brightness
Everyone...
Aw, you're all alone again.
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter!
She doesn't have any weapons.
I have a better chance fighting up close!
My legs!
Wh-What's going on? Something's wrong!
Noir Stardia
Movements and reactions become slower
This is...
Stone Bullet 40!
Clumsy boy!
Sh-She messed with my skills again?
Stone Bullet
Create and fire a stone from around 10100 centimeters by using LP.
After that, the stone comes back to you.
She made it worse?!
Did you figure it out?
Sh-She's unbelievable...
She's way more perceptive than I am, her instincts are insane,
and she's way better at using skills than I am.
Why don't you just give up?
I mean, you can still survive, albeit pathetically.
I'm not afraid of living pathetically.
Being born to a baronet family, I'm basically destined for a pathetic life.
Then why not run away? I don't mind looking away for a sec.
No matter how pathetic my life is...
As long as I try, I can change!
I learned that after I met Master!
And that's why... I'm going to save Master!
I don't have time to think about the outcome anymore!
I'm going to give up everything Master gave me except Get Creative,
Skills Skills Skills Skills
Noir Stardia
Editor, and Bestow...
Skills Skills
and use Sacrifice!
Sacrifice
It's hard!
Don't underestimate me...
you little brat!
I'll engulf you in flames until there's nothing left!
You and your silly feelings toward your master!
Sh-She still has this much power left?
She's way too strong!
Die!
But I have to...
I just have to do this!
I-I'll...
I'll curse y
Curse me all you want.
I have friends who can lift them!
Noir!
Y-You defeated her!
Well done.
I-It's all thanks to you guys.
Noir Stardia
But I think... I used up too much LP.
Noir...
Don't worry.
I-If that's the case...
Just leave it to us.
Wh-Whoa...
Th-Thanks, everyone.
Noir Stardia
And so, after defeating the Death Chains, I went to see Master.
There you are.
Noir, I'm free now.
Master...
Thank you. You worked so hard.
Master...
Now, now. You're ruining that adorable face of yours.
You must've been hurting for so long...
Why didn't you tell me?
Is it because I'm so unreliable?
You're just such a sweetheart. I didn't want you to push yourself.
But...
But apparently, you're much stronger and braver than I thought you were.
You're gonna make me fall for you.
Th-There you go, treating me like a kid again.
Aw, I wouldn't say that.
Stop playing with my face, please!
But I've been waiting so long to touch it!
Just a little bit, then...
If you hadn't shown up that day, I would still be stuck in that room.
I might've spent an eternity in there.
Well, my life changed so much because I met you, Master.
I'm very grateful.
Noir, thank you so much.
That's my line, Master.
Squeeze!
Master, that hurts! Let go!
Nope! Don't wanna!
Now, if I gamble these earnings at a casino...
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...
Brother Dearest, are these new?
Yeah, my friend helped me acquire them.
Nory, I hope you come see me again.
So in conclusion, becoming a hero is no small feat.
You'll need to train not only your body, but your mind, as well.
Make sure you don't slack off!
Yes, ma'am!
You need to put all of your weight into your fists.
You go like this... then this!
This move... sure is powerful!
Noir.
You need more LP, right?
Well, in that case...
Wha
Well? How's that?
Ah, Noir. You must need LP.
In that case...
Wh-Wha
Mine are pretty big, too.
Are you some kind of womanizer, Noir?
Hey, I saw that!
If you want more LP, you should talk to me first.
Oh, I see.
So we're fighting to the death over Brother Dearest.
I'll be happy to join in.
Did you get back all the skills you used for Sacrifice?
No, not completely.
I'm going to slowly build my LP back up and create them using Get Creative.
Way to go, Noir!
I bet you're doing all kinds of things with those girls.
M-More importantly, are we going to go past the 15th floor?
Yeah. when I was captured by the Death Chains, I heard its thoughts.
Free her without killing her and a path will appear
If we break that stone monument, there should be stairs under it.
I don't know how many floors this thing has,
but if you can get to floor 100, you might become as powerful as me.
Right!
Please wait for me.
Look at you, all confident.
Well, I am your student.
Excellent.
Hidden dungeon only I can enter!
Let me train in secret to become the strongest in the world!
