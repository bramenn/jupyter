That's mean, Kacchan.
Can't you see he's crying?
If you keep going...
I-I-I'll nevelfolgiveyou!
Even though you're Quirkless...
All men are not created equal.
This was the reality I learned about society at the young age of four.
And that was my...
That's a huge villain!
It all began in China, in Qingqing City.
There was news that a baby that gave off light was born.
Ever since then, superpowers were discovered in various places...
Before we knew it, the supernatural became normal,
The world has become a superhuman society,
and about 80 of the world's population now has some kind of special trait.
In this world swirling with chaos...
That profession is...
Oh, it's Death Arms!
He carries out justice through his great physical strength
The Punching Hero!
Everyone, this is dangerous.
Stay back, stay back!
The rescue specialist, Backdraft, is here, too!
But man, turning into a monster's an amazing Quirk.
What did he do?
He stole someone's bag and went out of control when he was cornered.
A Quirk like that, and he's a bag snatcher?
I'm sorry, the train's...
Yes, I don't know what time I will make it into work...
You can do it, Kamui!
Get away!
Who's fighting?
Kamui Woods!
The young and talented rising star!
You were the one asking, but you gave a perfect commentary, kid.
You're a fanboy, aren't you?
Uh, well...
Illegal use of powers during rush hour and robbery resulting in bodily injury.
You are the incarnation of evil.
Oh, here it comes!
Show us something flashy, Tree-Man!
Pre-emptive...
Canyon Cannon!
Huh?
Here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is.
Today is the day of my debut!
My name is Mt. Lady.
A pleasure to make your ass-quaintance.
Here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is.
Sh-She's getting the credit...
Along with the superpowers came an explosive increase in crime.
As the country was stuck in the slow progress of drastic law reforms,
courageous people started performing heroic acts from out of comic books.
Guarding against superpowers and defending against evil.
Heroes were soon accepted by the public,
and it was established as an official position.
Based on their performance, they are paid by the government...
Gigantification, huh?
She looks like she'll be popular, and it's an amazing Quirk,
but thinking about the damage to the city that'll go hand in hand with that,
its use might be limited?
No, but whether or not she can control the size...
Hey wait, you're taking notes? You wanna be a hero?
That's great! You can do it!
Yes! I'll do my best!
Since you're all third years, it's time for you to think seriously about your future.
I'll pass out handouts for your future plans now, but...
Yes!
Yes, yes, you all have wonderful Quirks!
But using your powers at school is against the rules!
Teach!
Don't lump us all in the same group.
I'm not gonna be stuck at the bottom with the rest of these rejects!
That was uncalled for, Katsuki!
Yeah, yeah!
You all should shut up like the extras you are!
Oh, if I remember correctly, you want to go to U.A. High, right, Bakugou?
It was in the top 0.2 this year, you know!
Their acceptance rate's always really low, too!
That's exactly why you guys are just extras!
I aced the mock test!
I'm the only one at this school who could possibly get into U.A.
I'll definitely surpass All Might and become the top hero!
My name'll be inscribed on the list of top earners!
Oh yeah, Midoriya wanted to go to U.A., too, right?
Huh? Midoriya? No way!
You can't get into the hero course just by studying!
Th-They got rid of that rule!
There's just no precedent...
Hey, Deku!
You're below the rejects! You're Quirkless!
How can you even stand in the same ring as me?
No, wait, Kacchan!
It's not like I'm trying to compete with you or anything!
Believe me!
It's just that it's been my goal ever since I was little.
And well...
Whaddaya mean, unless you try?!
Are you taking the test for fun?!
What the hell can you do?
You're Quirkless!
Thief!
Someone!
Catch me if you can!
Huh? There's no hero around.
Normally someone would come right away.
This guy's taking advantage of the chaos from this morning.
There are tons of people around who don't know what to do with their Quirks.
There's no end to them.
There is an end.
Why?
Because I am here!
Hey, let's go to karaoke!
Sure, nothing better to do.
The incident this morning is all over the headlines!
I wanna hurry up and go home so I can write it down in my notebook.
We're not done talking yet, Deku.
Katsuki, what's that?
Huh?
Hero Analysis for the Future?
Seriously?
Midoriya...
I-It's fine, isn't it? Give it back!
That's mean...
What?!
Most top first-string heroes have stories about them from their school days.
I want the shine of being able to be called the only student to make it into U.A.
from this mediocre city junior high school.
I mean, I'm a perfectionist.
He's so petty.
So anyway...
Come on, you could at least say something back.
Don't say that.
He's pathetic.
He still can't face reality.
If you wanna be a hero that badly, there's a quick way to do it.
Believe that you'll be born with a Quirk in your next life
and take a last chance dive off the roof!
What?
Idiot!
If I really jumped, that would mean you instigated a suicide!
Think before you speak!
That's not fish food, stupid.
That's my notebook...
Stupid...
Stupid bastard...
Mom!
Mom, the computer!
Again?
Hurry!
Jeez, you have probably added ten thousand views just by yourself, Izuku.
It's too scary for me. I can't watch it.
That was an old video.
A disaster that happened a long time ago.
The video of a hero that debuted right after that.
Can you see that? He's already saved a hundred people!
That's crazy! It hasn't even been ten minutes!
That's crazy!
He's laughing!
It's fine now.
Why?
Because I am here.
He's so cool!
Once I get my Quirk, I wanna be like him, too!
You should probably give it up.
That's...
Is something wrong with him after all?
Most of the other kindergarteners' Quirks have already manifested...
He's the only one...
Excuse me, but you're fourth generation, right, ma'am?
May I ask about your Quirk?
Yes, of course.
I can pull small objects to me.
My husband can breathe fire.
Normally, by age four, he would have manifested one of those Quirks,
or some combination of the two.
In the past, when the superpowers first started showing up, the results of an early research study were published.
It became common practice to see if the pinky toe was missing a joint or not.
When parts of the body aren't used, they're deemed unnecessary.
People who didn't have the joint were thought to be a newly evolved form.
You can see by looking at this x-ray
that Izuku has two joints.
It's unusual to see that these days,
but that means he has no Quirk.
Can you see that?
He's already saved a hundred people!
That's crazy! It hasn't even been ten minutes!
That's crazy!
He's laughing!
It's fine now.
Why?
Because I am here.
Mom...
He saves everyone with a smile, no matter what trouble they're in...
He's such a cool hero...
Can I... be a hero, too?
I'm sorry, Izuku!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
No, that's not it.
That's not it, Mom.
What I wanted you to say back then was...
You decided back then, didn't you?
That's right.
Don't worry about what other people think!
Hold your head up high and plunge forward!
A villain?!
A medium-sized invisibility cloak...
Don't worry.
I'm just going to take over your body.
Calm down.
It'll only hurt for about 45 seconds.
You'll feel better soon.
I can't... breathe...
You can't grab me. I'm fluid!
Thanks for your help.
You're my hero.
I didn't think that had come to this city.
My body...
There's no strength...
I'm dying... Am I dying?
I'm dying...
Somebody... Somebody...!
No...!
It's all right now, young man.
I am here!
Texas Smash!
Wind pressure...?!
All... Migh...
Hey! Hey! He Oh.
Thank goodness!
I'm glad you're okay!
Sorry'bout getting you caught up in my villain fighting.
I don't usually make mistakes like this,
but I was in high spirits on my day off in a new place.
But, you were a big help. Thanks!
I captured him safely!
The number one hero... All Might...
H-He's the real thing...
He looks completely different in person!
Oh, right! An a-autograph! Where should I?
In that notebook
He already did!
Th-Thank you very much!
It'll be an heirloom! A family treasure!
Okay!
Well, I need take this guy to the police.
See you again on the other side of the screen!
Wait, already?
Pros are constantly fighting enemies and time.
Wait...
There are still... things I want to ask...
Well then,
I'm counting on your continued support!
Wait.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let go of me! Your fanaticism is too much!
If I... let go now... I'll... I'll die...!
That's true.
Okay, okay!
I get it, so close your eyes and mouth!
Shit.
Th-That was scary...
Good grief.
If you talk to the people downstairs, I'm sure they'll let you down.
I seriously am outta time, so I really must go.
Wait! Um...
No! I will not wait!
But
You should probably give it up.
I'm sorry, Izuku!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
What the hell can you do?
You're Quirkless!
That might be true...
But... even so... I...
Even if I don't have a Quirk, can I become a hero?
Can even someone without a Quirk be like you?
My meeting with All Might... This miracle...
At the time, I couldn't even imagine how much it would change my fate.
I am here for the next episode preview!
What? The villain I caught escaped?
It took a boy hostage and is going wild around town?
But I can't use my powers for much longer.
You're pathetic, All Might!
Is there another hero around?
Next time, What It Takes to Be a Hero!
Pros are always risking their lives!
Go beyond!
Plus Ultra!
