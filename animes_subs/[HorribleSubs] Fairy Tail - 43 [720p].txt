Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
U-U-Uh, oh!
Laxus's Raijin Tribe have come and attacked in the middle of the Harvest Festival!
They ruined the Miss Fairy Tail Contest, and took the contestants hostage,
and now they've started some battle game!
I have to do something!
Except I happened to be stoned right now!
It seems like there's some trouble at Fairy Tail.
What's going on?
Their members are fighting amongst each other.
It's not just quarreling, they've been seriously going at each other!
I hope their big parade, Fantasia, will be okay.
Fairy Tail again?
Don't go crazy in the city!
Citizens?
I see. It seems the rules inside the rune barriers only affect wizards.
Visitar!
Nab!
Play nice and let yourself get blown away!
If I don't put you to sleep, I can't go search for Laxus!
This isn't the time to be fighting amongst ourselves,
but if that's the way you want it!
Max!
I've seen through your plans!
You're planning a surprise attack using your Sand Magic, aren't you?
Your specialty, Telepathy?
But even if you know it's coming, you can't dodge my attack, Warren!
Take this!
I told you, I can read your mind!
That's pretty flashy for some festival show.
Here they go again...
What a bunch of troublemakers they are!
Defeat your Friends to Save your Friends!
This is for Mira-chan! Now hurry and take defeat like a man!
A married man shouldn't be lusting after her like that!
Like you should talk, divorcee!
Bring it on!
Laki! Yeah, it's the Harvest Festival, but...
What's with the sudden style change?
It looks slutty!
Gunning for the Miss Fairy Tail Contest?
All I did was cut my hair, and look at all the fuss...
I'm such a bad -girl!
Now I'm mad!
Get her!
There!
Max vs. Warren. Winner: Warren.
Vistar vs. Nab. Winner: Nab.
Laki took out four, Macao vs. Wakaba's battle is in progress.
Enough! Stop this, you foolish children!
Rune traps have been set up throughout the city.
And the ones who are trapped inside are forced to fight.
That's the Battle of Fairy Tail that Laxus talked about.
But why? I don't get it!
Natsu...
I wanna join, too!
That's what he's upset about?
What's with this invisible wall?
And what do you plan to do by joining in?
It's a tournament to see who's the strongest!
How is this a tournament?
This is all just Laxus's plan to get us to wipe each other out!
Unless we can defeat the Raijin Tribe within the time limit,
Erza and the other girls will turn to dust.
Everyone is doing whatever they can to prevent that.
It'll need something more than our usual way of thinking to take control of the situation!
At this rate everyone who was turned to stone with crumble into dust.
There won't be any way to restore them.
Laxus acts bad, but he ain't gonna go that far.
Yeah, he gets on my nerves, but he's a fellow guild member.
It's a bluff, obviously.
Natsu.
This is just a fighting festival!
But then why can't I get out?
I can go through normally!
People over 80 years old can't pass through...
Does that mean I'm over 80?
I don't think you are, but...
You call Laxus your fellow member?
You don't believe that he'll go that far?
There's 2 hours and 18 minutes left.
And there are... 42 people left.
42 people? More than half are gone after the infighting!
Go! Purple Rain!
My Smoke Fake. You're getting rusty.
You've always been too soft on people...
The East Forest... The East Forest...
I have to see Poluchka and get a potion to cure Erza and the others...
I-It can't be!
Are the runes set up around the entire city?
I will allow no one to break my rules.
Freed!
Laxus should have told you that the field of battle was the entire city.
If you're a wizard, then fight! Show me your power.
That's the rule.
And so...
Damn it, where are those Raijin Tribe?
It's Gray!
Those are Bicslow's...
Yo!
Let's play!
Evergreen!
If you're a Man, then don't take hostages!
Return my sister and the others to normal!
Well, I'm not a man...
I love flowers.
They look so good... on me.
The only thing that's cute about you is your name.
Elfman.
Return my sister and the others to normal!
Can you beat me while you're blindfolded?
There you are!
I see! So you can tell where I am by smell.
It's too bad though, because you are already inside my Fairy Dust.
Fairy Bomb, Gremlin!
I love statues.
No matter how ugly a monster might be, they become a beautiful work of art when turned to stone.
Now, gaze at me.
Give your body up to beauty...
Evergreen vs. Elfman. Winner: Evergreen.
Elfman: Out of commission.
I can't believe Elfman got beat!
Gray's fighting Bicslow! I wanna join in!
Reedus is fighting Freed, too!
The Raijin Tribe has started to make their move!
I guess that's it.
Hold it!
Let's settle this fight, man to man!
I mean, man to girl!
I thought you turned to stone.
The magic wore off, and I came after you!
I bet you don't know the tricks this man, I mean woman, has up her sleeves!
Do you even have the courage to face me like a man, I mean woman?
Whoops!
A fake you made with your magic?
You are a wizard who can make anything he paints come to life, after all.
If I hadn't known that, I might have been fooled.
Freed?
I'm begging you, don't hurt anyone any more...
You aren't that kind of man...
Battle of Fairy Tail... 40 people left.
Reedus was beaten!
I figured Freed could do it! Look at him go!
Is this really the time to be impressed?
Now we can't get any help from Poluchka!
We don't need any.
The whole turning to dust thing is a bluff.
You think I'm bluffing, Natsu?
Laxus!
It's a thought projection!
So why are you still here, Natsu?
I can't get out!
Laxus...
Your members... Well, I guess you call them your children.
I bet you can't stand watching your children destroy each other, can you?
Natsu and Erza can't join in...
There's no one left who could defeat my Raijin Tribe, is there?
Gonna give in?
Gray's still there!
He's about as strong as Natsu!
He ain't gonna lose to no Raijin Tribe!
The same as me?
Him?
But it's the truth!
Gray?
I wouldn't put much faith in that brat.
Don't underestimate Gray, Laxus!
Line Formation!
Not bad, Gray!
Next up, Victory Formation!
What's the matter, Babies?
When did he...
Ice Make Hammer!
X Formation!
What's this?
Part of my Seith Magic is the ability to possess the souls of dolls!
Even if you freeze the dolls, I can transfer their souls to other bodies!
What?
This guy's gonna be annoying...
Don't you get it? No matter how many of my dolls you destroy, it's no use!
Then I'll freeze you directly instead!
Go ahead and try!
What, trying to escape?
Wait!
That bastard...
Where the hell did he go?
Up here, Gray!
What in the world are you up to?
I told you! I want to play with strong opponents!
My babies are gettin' all bored recently!
Runes?
Using magic is prohibited for those within the barrier until the battle is over!
One of Freed's traps?
Guess a long-distance wizard like myself has a bit of an advantage here!
I knew that without your magic, you'd be completely helpless!
You think?
Think you can hit me?
That won't cut it, Gray!
Don't, honey. Stand back from the window.
But!
Why that little... And after he got hit by my babies like that!
My extra clothing helped cushion against the damage... Don't go scaring me like that.
You should wear some heavy clothing sometimes, Gray.
Gray is out of commission. 28 people left.
See, didn't I tell you?
Liar! I'm sure that he used some dirty trick!
So who will beat the Raijin Tribe now?
Gajeel will!
Too bad. Doesn't seem like he's participatin'.
He doesn't actually give a damn about the guild anyway.
Well, I'm still here!
If you can't get out, it won't do you any good.
Fine, enough!
I surrender.
Gramps!
Now, stop this Laxus.
Can't do that.
The high and mighty Master of Fairy Tail can't go surrendering at a time like this!
But if you insist, then how about you give up your position as Master to me?
That's playing dirty, Laxus!
You scared a me, huh?
You fiend...
Was that your goal all along?
It's only one and a half hours until the statues crumble.
If you want to retire, use the guild's loudspeakers and announce it so the whole town can hear.
Say, I'm giving up my position as Master of Fairy Tail to Laxus!
Think about it well.
Which is more important, your position or your friends?
Hold it, damn it!
If you won't fight me, how are you the strongest?
How can you be the master?
I don't care about being master.
You're okay with it?
But I cannot entrust Fairy Tail to Laxus!
He doesn't understand the weight of the positoin!
He lacks conviction and heart!
But at this rate Lucy and the others will turn to dust...
Someone has to defeat Laxus and his gang, or...
Gajeel, that's where you were?
Don't eat the dishware!
Are you going to go?
I've got a bone to pick with him.
Just leave him to me.
Are you also 80?
No, obviously!
At about that time...
Gremlin!
So weak...
Stop it, Bicslow! We're your allies!
I'm not on the side of weaklings!
Ain't that right, babies?
Freed!
Alzack...
Thanks to your runes, I've hurt my friends too much.
I told myself it was to change Bisca back to normal...
Guns Magic! Tornado Shot!
He sliced through the wind magic?
What is this? I can't breathe...
You're using some strange magic other than the runes...
Bisca...
Anyone who uses magic inside these runes will be deprived of oxygen.
All I did was use runes to their fullest effect.
You think there's anyone who can beat me under my rules? Me, the creator?
Battle of Fairy Tail. So, 2 are left?
Only 2 are left?
Why can't you get out either?
Stop copyin' me!
How should I know?
Now I'm hungry, you bastard!
I really don't know!
Two?
Just you two?
And I wasn't even counted?
I have no more wizards left to fight.
I guess that's it...
Oh, well. Guess I better revive Erza.
What?
And I thought I could finally show up Erza...
Hold it!
What are you gonna do?
Won't she melt if I heat her?
You know, the stone shell...
Don't!
Erza and the others have turned to stone completely!
We won't know'till we try, right?
Stop it! You want to kill Erza?
Broil her nice and good...
Are you going to rub her with flames?
Hey buddy, not so frisky.
Shoot, she broke!
Glue, glue! Happy, get the glue!
Aye, sir!
You idiot! You think that'll fix her up?
Use your flames on my iron, and we'll weld her back together!
Fools!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
It's hot...
Was it you, Natsu?
What were you trying to do?
Erza's back!
Thank goodness.
But, how?
I don't really know.
Perhaps it's because of my right eye.
I see! The artificial eye must have lowered the effect of the magic.
Erza, do you know what's going on?
Yes. Even though I was turned to stone, I could hear you.
Go! It's time for a counter attack!
3 remaining.
With me restored, the number remaining changed appropriately.
How elaborate.
Those three are Natsu, Gajeel, and Erza, right?
4 remaining?
It increased?
Who?
Everyone is still stone... Then who?
There's one more out there, remember? Outside of the city.
You don't mean... Him?
No way!
Does this mean he's back?
Looks like the real war is about to begin. This is getting interesting.
Who are you talking about?
Another possible candidate for the strongest in Fairy Tail...
Mystogan!
Erza's restored and Mystogan joins the fray...
Including me, that's the top three in Fairy Tail.
Can't be a festival without the best, right?
Then!
You showed up earlier!
That was a fake...
What's up with the outfit, Erza-chan!
Anyway, a bunch of young folks from your place
have been fighting around the city and causing trouble.
I apologize. It's part of the preparations for the grand parade.
That's some strange preparations all right.
Please look forward to it.
Of course!
Try not to fight so much though,'kay?
How did you return from a statue back to normal?
Well, fine by me. It just means I get to have fun tormenting you more!
Evergreen!
You really make me angry. Why are you the Fairy Queen, Titania?
I am the number one fairy!
That time we laughed, saying we're both like each other,
we even kindly overlooked the little lies.
If we lose a place to go back to together, I don't care.
Because I'll protect that smile.
The meetings and partings numerous as the stars in the sky...
All the things I don't want to lose...
Right now I feel like I don't need any of them.
I just want to see you by my side,
all my happiness and sadness.
Let's start from here.
Let's start our tomorrow.
Let's do it like we've just been reborn.
Like flowers blown in a summer wind,
let us bloom brightly in this instant.
Natsu, if you keep baring your stomach, your belly button will get stolen!
Huh? You can steal belly buttons?
But Lucy said so!
If you stick out your stomach when lightning strikes,
the god of lightning will take your belly button away!
But Happy, you don't have a belly button.
Thunder Palace!
Now that you mention it, yeah.
Only rumbling I'm scared of is Gramps' grumbling.
Good one. Give him a point.
