Ash and his friends arrive in Mossgreen Village.
It's a quaint, cute place,
but it's so small it doesn't even have its own Pokemon Gym.
There's no use stopping here if they don't have a Gym.
- We don't have any choice. -Huh?
We have a big problem. Check out our potion and antidote bag.
Huh? It's empty.
I'd say this is a good time to stock up on supplies.
Might as well grab a bite to eat, too.
I'm dying for a cheeseburger.
No way. I want to eat in a nice restaurant.
- Cheeseburgers are nice. - Are not.
Will you two cut it out?
-Come on, let's go. -Fine with me.
-Come on, Pikachu. -Pika.
Say, what's that rustling in those bushes?
It looks like those brats are heading into town.
Let's sneak ahead of them.
-Wait. Aren't we forgetting something? -Forgetting what?
Hey, Meowth, catnap's over.
Get up before I lose my... Ooh. Huh.
Argh!
He's burning up!
Ah. l don't feel so great.
Too bad we can't wait around for you to chill out.
-Hold on. -Hmm?
If we leave Meowth here, he could collapse from that fever.
Don't worry. He's still got eight more lives left.
That's a good point.
This time we're going to nab that Pikachu.
-Pikachu for me and you. Let's go. - Hold it!
-Hmm? -Huh?
Oh, you poor thing. You're so hot.
How could you even think of abandoning your Pokemon
when it's overheated like this, you irresponsible trainers?
-Huh? -Hmm?
-Does she think... -That we're Meowth's trainers?
Why are you laughing?
You must be joking if you think we'd ever be the trainers of that thing.
Don't you recognize superheroes when you see them?
You're superheroes?
Sometimes we both go undercover.
But our enemies soon discover.
We're the Team Rocket super squad.
You're super losers if you'd leave a sick Pokemon!
-I guess you're right. -We are sorry.
Don't worry. I'll make something to cool you down.
Meowth.
-Hmm. -Hmm.
-Here, drink this. -Thank you.
-Whoa. -Amazing.
It'll be fine now.
Just give it one of these pills after each meal.
-Uh, sure. -See you later.
Ah, she really cared about me.
Meowth's turning red again.
-Maybe it's getting sick again. -I'm not sick.
-He's back... -To normal.
Oh.
Is anybody home? Hello?
Excuse me.
We'd like to buy some potions and antidotes.
Got some snakeroot that'll cure insomnia and grow hair on your nose and tongue.
-Grow hair on your nose and tongue? -Uh, does it come in a no-hair formula?
Grandma, I've asked you before not to frighten the customers.
I didn't mean to scare anyone.
I know, but we're here to help trainers with our miracle potions,
-not scare them away. - Huh?
Uh, my name's Brock. Are you the owner of this Pokemon pharmacy?
Yes, with my grandma.
I'm interested in Pokemon potions. If you're not doing anything tonight,
maybe we could have dinner together and talk about them.
Hm. Are all three of you Pokemon trainers?
-Uh, well- -Instead of dinner,
how about a Pokemon battle?
-Huh? -Okay, you can battle with me.
That's great. We can battle out back.
-To protect the world from devastation. -To unite all peoples within our nation.
Yeah, well, unite all people after that girl comes out.
- What girl? - Who do you mean?
That's her. It's the nice nurse.
Now, wait, Meowth.
Don't forget our mission is to capture Pikachu.
-Huh? -She's captured my heart.
Paras, Paras, Paras.
This Paras will be your opponent.
Uh, a Paras?
Paras, the mushroom Pokemon.
Rare mushrooms grow on its back.
-Pikachu. -Paras? Paras.
Paras, you can't give up already.
Seems like your Pokemon doesn't want to battle us.
You're right. I'd love for Paras to evolve
into a Parasect very soon.
But it's too cowardly to battle.
The best way for Pokemon to evolve is by winning battles.
The more battles they win, the quicker they evolve.
But what do you want to make Paras evolve so fast for?
Because I have to have Parasect's mushroom.
Why do you need Parasect's mushroom?
You see, after Paras evolves,
I'll use its mushroom to make a new potion especially for Pokemon,
and I'll use the new potion to help Pokemon all over the world.
She's too terrific to be human.
That's it, I'd give up all nine lives to make Cassandra's dream come true.
-He's going to make a fool of himself. -Oh, I understand.
You must think this Cassandra is the cat's Meowth?
That ain't funny!
Don't be shy. I know exactly how you feel about her.
You don't think I'm an idiot?
You might say that Cassandra's one female who really knows how to treat a feline.
I was so unprepared for love.
Well, cupid's arrow strikes when you least expect it.
Help me catch, Pikachu, you two lovebird brains.
Just this once, since it's for a good cause,
we're going to let Paras win, okay?
Pika.
Good luck, Paras. All the Pokemon on earth are counting on you.
Paras.
Pikachu, electric... Uh, I mean...
What's the matter, Ash?
-Electric shock might be overdoing it. -Yeah, you might be right.
-Look, Paras is making the first move. -Paras.
Pikachu, thunder shock.
Or, uh, maybe just a teeny static bolt.
Pikachu.
Paras.
-Oh. -Oh, no.
Hey, that wasn't fair.
But it was humiliating.
What a pathetic Paras.
How will Paras ever get any experience?
-Pika. -Oh, this is a tough one.
What am I supposed to do now?
Look up, Paras' type, and we'll just choose a weaker opponent.
Good idea.
Paras has qualities of both bug and grass Pokemon.
Grass-type Pokemon have a big advantage against water Pokemon.
Right, a water type.
-Squirtle, I choose you! -Squirtle.
Hey, that Squirtle is a water type.
-Maybe you can win, Paras. -Paras?
Squirtle, use your water gun,
but just enough to sprinkle the mushrooms a little.
Squirtle? Ooh. Squirtle.
Paras.
Paras, oh, are you hurt?
-Paras. -Please give it one more try.
-Squirtle. -Squirtle, return.
I'm not going to give up until Paras has evolved into Parasect.
I choose you, Charmeleon!
-Char. -Your turn, Charmeleon. Go easy on it.
Char.
-Pika. -Charmeleon?
Charmeleon doesn't look like a loser.
-Char. -Paras.
It's okay, hang in there.
-Char. -No, stop, Charmeleon.
-Char. -Paras.
-Char. -Paras.
Oh.
-Paras, Paras. -Paras, wait.
-Char. Char. -What are you doing, Charmeleon?
-Char. -Ah!
Oh, that wasn't nice.
-Char. -Charmeleon.
It's way out of control.
Pikachu!
-Pika. -Oh. Thanks, Pikachu.
-Ash. -Are you okay, Ash?
Uh...
Oh, dear, Paras has run away.
I didn't want to beat it.
Mm-hm, it's my fault for challenging you to a Pokemon battle.
I was so happy when Charmander evolved, but now I'm not sure I was ready for it.
Oh, Ash, worry about your stupid Charmeleon later.
We've got to look for Cassandra's Paras.
You're right, let's get going.
Paras, Paras, Paras. Paras, Paras, Paras, Par... Paras?
Paras.
Huh.
Did you find Paras?
No, we didn't.
There's no sign of it anywhere.
I'm really sorry. This was all my fault.
- No, Ash. -Pika?
It's not you.
Poor Paras doesn't have any confidence in its own abilities.
Oh.
Uh, so, what about this potion? Uh, what's it supposed to do?
Um, I'm trying to come up with a miracle potion.
One that'll not only restore a Pokemon's defensive powers,
but its attack power, concentration, and its determination as well
and make it smarter, too.
-You're trying to make a smart potion? -Pika.
When it's done, you should give Ash a taste.
I want all Pokemon to grow and stay healthy.
That's why I need Paras to realize how important it is
and to believe in itself.
- And? -And... and what?
And if James and I help this worthless little Paras, what's in it for us?
What do we get?
I'll tell you what you get.
If you two make this Paras evolve,
then you could become rich beyond your wildest dreams.
Hmm?
Cassandra's miracle Pokemon potion could make millions, maybe even zillions.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
And how do we get rich from her potion?
Once me and her are a cozy twosome, she'll make me her company mascot.
-We're thrilled for you. -But we won't get rich.
I was planning on making you two my business managers.
I'll have a lot of money to manage.
But if you'd rather not, I'll understand.
Hmm.
Just imagine, we'll have more money than we can count.
We can count on that.
Who cares about cash?
I just want to spend the rest of my nine lives
with that trainer of yours, Cassandra.
I can picture it now, her and me sitting on a porch on summer nights.
Who would have thought living with a human could be so purr-fect.
Ah. Ah!
What's the idea?
Stop daydreaming.
Hurry up, we want to get rich quick.
I can't do that unless you lend me Arbok and Weezing.
What do you need those two for?
Hmm,'cause losing battles is their specialty.
He's got a point.
They're bigger losers than the guy who invented homework.
How did we get stuck with such rejects?
Arbok.
-Paras? -
Arbok.
Paras? Paras, Paras.
Congratulations to our champion. That was stupendous, Paras.
-You're a heavyweight. -Paras.
Now let's bring on our next challenger.
-Paras? -Meowth.
Paras?
-Paras, Paras. -
It looks like another knockout.
Slow down, tiger. Don't get too much experience.
Paras.
-Hey, I think it's going to evolve. -Paras. Paras. Paras.
-Oh. -Needs more victories.
Let's see if it's tough enough to defeat me.
-Put them up, champ. -Paras.
Ouch. Oh, Meowth.
I'm a goner. You're too strong.
Paras, Paras, Paras.
Paras, Paras, Paras.
Paras, Paras. Paras.
A few lousy wins and it thinks it's Tarzan.
It's got confidence.
-Hey, Paras. -It's the brats.
Maybe they can help us get Paras to evolve.
- Come on out. Hey, Paras. - Hey, Paras.
-Paras. -Paras.
It's Paras.
There you are.
How'd it get up in that tree?
Paras, Paras.
It's acting strange. I've never seen it act like this before.
I wonder what happened.
Maybe it's Paras' sparring partner.
-Paras. -Pikachu.
-Paras, Paras. -I think it wants to battle.
Oh, Paras, you finally understand my dream.
That's excellent.
Pikachu, it's time to help Paras evolve into Parasect.
Pikachu.
My plan is going to work.
-If it wins... -We'll be rich.
-Get it, Paras. -Paras.
Remember, Pikachu, go easy on it.
-Pikachu. Pika-pi. -Paras. Paras.
Pika!
Pika. Pika...
Pikachu, mm-mm-mm.
Pika, pika.
Par?
-Paras, Paras, Paras. -That's great, Paras wins.
-Paras. -Paras sure looks proud of itself.
If you keep battling it like this,
then Paras is almost sure to gain enough experience to evolve into Parasect.
Yes.
Charmeleon, one more time!
Char.
Charmeleon, I'm counting on you this time.
Char.
Hey, what's the matter? Charmander was always totally obedient.
Its trainer needs experience.
If the trainer is poor, the Pokemon won't respect him and won't obey orders.
Oh.
Call it back. We quit. Charmeleon's too strong.
-Charmeleon, return. -Char.
See.
Charmeleon won't obey Ash.
-Char. Char. -Paras, Paras.
Knock it off, Charmeleon.
Please, stop.
I got to do something to help Paras win.
-Meowth is right. -Our zillions depend on it.
-Char. -Paras.
-Paras, you can beat it. -Paras?
What are you all doing here?
It's Team Rocket.
We're the official Pokemon pep squad, here to cheer on our hero.
Go, Paras.
Paras, don't forget all the training we gave you.
You're pumped for victory.
-There's no way you can lose. -You're a winner.
They really helped train Paras?
Let's hear it. Give a cheer for our ace, the great Paras!
Paras. Paras. Stomp and stamp.
-You bet. - Paras. Paras. That's our champ.
Oh.
Char.
Paras. Par? Paras!
Char, char, char, char, char, char.
Paras. Paras. Paras. Par...
-Oh! -Don't do it, Charmeleon.
-Char. -Par.
Huh?
Paras?
Oh.
Wow.
Oh!
Pika.
-Parasect. -Oh.
-Wow. -It really evolved.
Parasect, the mushroom Pokemon, it battles using poison spheres
that spread from the mushroom canopy on its back.
We're all proud of you, Parasect.
I never doubted you. Great job, Parasect.
Yahoo.
All aboard the gravy train.
- -Char.
Huh?
Team Rocket's blasting off again!
Char.
-Parasect, stay back. -Parasect.
Char.
What's that?
It's Parasect's special attack. It's using spore attack.
That's amazing. One spray.
If Parasect's spore attack is that effective,
it'll definitely make a powerful potion.
Charmeleon, return now.
Looks like you have to evolve into a better trainer, Ash.
Next time I'll be fine.
Pika, pika.
Thanks for helping me, Parasect. I knew I'd be able to count on you.
Parasect.
Now it's my turn to help. I'm going to make my miracle potion
and help improve all the Pokemon in the world.
Parasect.
I'm sorry we caused so much trouble for you all.
Well, losing on purpose is the toughest thing we've ever done.
-Isn't it, Pikachu? -Pikachu.
You'll keep on losing if you don't bring up your skill level.
You promised to be nice, Grandma.
Let us know when you finish your new potion, Cassandra.
I'll be your first customer.
See you later.
Thanks again. Good luck on your journey, everyone.
Goodbye. Good luck.
And just as Ash and friends are saying goodbye,
guess who's dropping in?
Huh?
I'm so happy. I got to be the luckiest cat in the entire universe.
A little tighter, please.
-Parasect. -And here's my star pupil
who went from chump to champ in record-breaking time.
How can we ever repay you?
Thanks to you, we'll make the greatest potion ever known.
It was nothing after you cooled me off, it was the least I could do.
-She's falling for it. -We'll be rich.
Now that fate's thrown us together to help the Pokemon of the world,
I guess it's only natural to make me your company mascot-
-Never! -Huh?
I'd never tear you away from Team Rocket. You're a superhero team, aren't you?
-Well, we are super. -And a team.
It was super heroic to help out with Paras like that.
-Then why- - We've already got
-a company mascot anyway. -Huh?
Persian.
I found this Persian snoozing in the backyard.
It's adorable.
Oh, Meowth, I promise to pamper this Persian just like it was you.
Now you can go on being a superhero.
-There go our billions. -And zillions.
I'm a hero, but I got zero.
Cheer up, Meowth. Every dog has his day.
Maybe you will, too... maybe.
