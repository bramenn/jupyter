The Nine Olde Witches sealed the Grand Triskelion within Arcturus Forest.
Only the seven Words and the staff of seven stars can break the seal.
Early morning lessons, day seven. Are you ready, Akko?
Eek eek!
Hey, wait!
Oh! Oh no no!
I'll keep practicing and getting better, little by little.
I'll keep practicing and get better little by little.
And at the moment I master metamorphosis magic...
I'll become a Moonlit Witch like Chariot!
I heard Chariot earned it after showing off her miraculous metamorphosis magic.
Professor, I thought you'd already know that.
Y-Yes, I knew!
Of course she did. Right, definitely.
The Samhain Festival will start soon.
Madame Ural is a stellar magic novelist and won the Nobel Prize in literature.

The students are to prepare displays of magic as a collective effort.
Each student will prepare a magic presentation with their teams.
This occurred during the previous Samhain Festival.
Boiling of toads for the use of enchantments.
A toad boiling enchantment.
A full-course medieval magic meal.

Let us assign Samhain Festival duties to each team.
Please send one representative up to pull from the drawing.
Well so do I.
Hey! Y'all are in charge of fireworks!
Fire magic?!
Lucky you.
Akko!
This pot contains the age-old ghost, Bewailing Bahalowa.
Bewailing Bahalowa?
Bahalowa wakes with the midnight toll at the close of the Festival, wailing and flailing about.
After consuming them, Bahalowa rests once more until the dawn of the next Samhain Festival.
Ladies, gather around Diana and work together to make this Samhain Festival a success.
I thought the Samhain Festival was supposed to be fun.
So why do they include this ghost eating sacrifices thing?
Bewailing Bahalowa was a member of the royalty from the Book Kingdom in the second century BCE.
However, as he was losing his friends in the last years of his life,
However, as he lost his friends in the last years of his life,
Bahalowa mourned, saying'This world has nothing but sorrow', eventually turning into the bewailing ghost.
Come on, Bahalowa!
This is all your fault for crying all the time!
I don't think that's going to happen. Diana will probably end up being selected.
Just thinking about passing through the inside of a ghost gives me the chills!
You're the one I can't believe wants to be the Moonlit Witch when you can't even ride a broom.
It can't be helped. We picked our duties randomly.
Okay, we should start our sacrifice duty meeting
Let's get ready for our meeting about sacrifice duty.
We collected all these mirrors, but we're not sure which to use.
Could you pick which one you think is best?
Just like this.
Why did this happen?!
Now stay like that until tomorrow morning and the curse will be lifted.
I had just completed my cleaning of your room.
As I was cleaning, your classmates came by in a rush looking for you.
L-Leave all your hopes in my capable hands.
Th-There is nothing that I cannot possibly do!
The mirror did this, I presume. It's easy to imagine.
I am motivated! I'm serious about following in Chariot's footsteps!
Diana is amazing.
This world was once abundant with the power of good magic.
However, magic is consistently weakening in this era.
I plan to seek the ultimate power of the Grand Triskelion to return the magic of today to its former glory.
I plan to seek the ultimate power of the Grand Triskelion to revitalize magic in this world.
What am I compared to her?
And here I have zero chance of winning...
I'm just a little kid compared to her.
But you know, I bet that even Chariot failed and worried and got discouraged, maybe more than you'd think.
But you know, I bet that even Chariot failed and worried and got discouraged more than you'd think.
Goodness, what am I to do with you?
Watch me! I can feel power in my heart when I say this chant!
Arae Arilla!
Arae Arilla!
Arae Arilla!
Arae Arilla...
The Nine Olde Witches sealed the Grand Triskelion within Arcturus Forest.
Only the seven Words and the staff bearing the seven stars can break the seal.
Early morning lessons, day seven. Are you ready, Akko?
Yes!
Monkey.
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Eek!
Eek?
N-Not too bad.
Next, an elephant.
Metamorphie Faciesse!
G-Good, you're doing well.
Whawait!
Oh? Oh no no!
Get away! Shoo, shoo!
Professor Ursula, thanks again.
I think I had it perfectly at the start!
S-Sure...
I'll keep practicing, and get better little by little.
And the moment I master metamorphosis magic...
I'll become a Moonlit Witch, like Chariot!
Moonlit Witch
Chariot was chosen as the Moonlit Witch during Luna Nova's Samhain Festival.
Moonlit Witch...
It's proof that you're the best witch around.
I heard she earned it after showing off her miraculous metamorphosis magic.
Shouldn't you know that, Professor?
Y-Yes, I do know!
That's what happened. Right, definitely.
The Samhain Festival will be here soon.
I'll train my hardest and try to inch closer to Chariot!
Now then, what should I transform into tomorrow...
Akko revived the first Word as well.
With this, she has also revived the second.
There are seven Words of Arcturus in total.
Revive the remaining Words.
Chariot.
You will aid her.
I'll become the Moonlit Witch!

Extra! Extra!
The witches invited to the Samhain Festival have been announced!
The rock star, Miss Marjolaine?!
Minister Dorlin from the East Mogiana Republic!
And Madame Ural too! Impressive lineup this year.
Madame Ural is a Nobel Laureate in literature and considered the leading authority on magic novels.
Look at all the witches from around the world!
I'm so excited! The Samhain Festival is going to be amazing!
Doesn't Akko know?
How am I supposed to tell her now?
I can't wait to meet all those witches from faraway places!
On the upcoming day of October 31st,
we will be holding the Samhain Festival, a tradition spanning back sixteen hundred years.
This is our opportunity to demonstrate the might and mettle of Luna Nova to alumnae from around the world.
All students are to prepare displays of magic in their teams.
This was offered during the previous Samhain Festival.
Boiling of toads for enchantments.
Memorizing ten thousand incantations.
Ancient dark dance.
A full course medieval magic dinner.
Seriously?
The Samhain Festival is this lame?
At the close of the Samhain Festival, the most exceptional witch will be chosen.
She will be granted the title of Moonlit Witch.
Chariot was chosen at the Moonlit Witch!
We will now assign Samhain Festival duties to the teams.
Each team, please send one representative up to draw your lot.
Who should do it?
You, right?
I can't! I have the worst luck in lotteries!
Well, so do I...
Hey! You kids are in charge of fireworks!
Fireworks magic?!
Lucky you...
Already taken, huh.
You ladies shall do the decorations.
That's okay, I guess.
Your team is assigned to summoning.
Summoning?!
That's the showpiece of the Festival!
Hmph. You maggots get cleaning duty.
Cleaning duty?
The remaining teams should send their representatives at once!
We need to pick something.
Go do it, Akko.
There's no way!
Representative of that team, get up here now.
Sucy! No, Lotte!
Hurry!
Akko!
Akko!
Um... this one?
No, I've got a bad feeling. Maybe...
Choose now, or I'll be choosing which of your nails to tear out!
Oh, fine!
You can be the sacrifices.
Sacrifices?
What kind of duty is that?
You want to know what the sacrifices do?
This pot contains an age-old ghost, Bachoalawy the Bewailing.
Bachoalawy the Bewailing?
Bachoalawy wakes with the midnight toll at the close of the Festival, wailing and flailing about.
That is when the sacrifices are offered.
After consuming them, Bachoalawy rests once more until the dawn of the next Samhain Festival.
The people on sacrifice duty die?!
There is no danger to your lives.
The sacrifices pass through the ghost's bowels and are safely excreted.
That's gross!
Sacrifice duty! It's like poetry!
You couldn't pick a more fitting role for Akko if you tried!
Silence!
We must focus on our Samhain Festival duties at hand. Save your prattle for later.
Exactly.
Also, Diana Cavendish.
You have been voted in as Luna Nova's youngest ever Samhain Festival committee chair.
How wonderful, Diana!
You're the best, Diana!
Ladies, rally around Diana and work together to make this Samhain Festival a success.
Yes!
What's with the whole sacrifice duty?
Wasn't the Samhain Festival supposed to be fun?
So why do they have to include this ghost eating sacrifices stuff?
Bachoalawy the Bewailing was a member of the royal family of the Book Kingdom in the second century BCE.
He spent his life in happiness surrounded by friends.
However, after he lost his friends in the last years of his life,
Bachoalawy mourned, saying'This world has nothing but sorrow', and eventually turned into a ghost of bewailing.
What, just because of that?
It goes on to say that since he's crying even in his sleep, he needs to eat sacrifices to sate his hunger.
Want one?
Come on, Bachoalawy!
It's your own fault for crying all the time!
You're making me feel like crying here, geez!
All my hard work trying to be the Moonlit Witch like Chariot is going to go to waste.
Hang on, Akko. Are you really trying to be chosen as the Moonlit Witch?
Huh?
I don't think that's going to happen. Diana will likely end up being selected.
Yeah, probably.
Right?
And what makes you so sure?
Because Diana comes from a prestigious family.
She was born with talent running through her veins.
Does that mean you don't care about being the Moonlit Witch, Lotte?
I'm only here so that I can properly inherit my family's magic item shop.
What about you, Sucy?
The thought of passing through the inside of a ghost is giving me shivers!
Unbelievable...
You're telling me.
I can't believe it.
Right?!
I don't mean her.
You're the one I can't believe, wanting to be the Moonlit Witch when you can't even ride a broom.
That's true.
Yeah.
It can't be helped. Our duties fell to us randomly.
You got your hopes up by putting your head in the clouds.
Isn't this the perfect role for you?
Okay, we should prepare for our sacrifice duty meeting
How can you all accept this?!
We're in charge of preparing the mirror for the Samhain Festival,
and there's something we need your advice about.
We collected all these mirrors, but we're not sure which one to use.
Could you pick the one you think is best?
Certainly. If these are our options...
Yes, this one contains the most magic power.
Unfortunately, it appears to be a prankster.
Polishing it with fairy powder should rein in its mischievous spirit.
Really?
I'll request the powder from the teachers. Let's go pick it up together.
Thanks, Diana!
No wonder you're the committee chair! We can always rely on you.
You're a shoe-in for Moonlit Witch!
Thank you. But we cannot yet say for sure who will be selected as Moonlit Witch.
That was close!
Wait, why am I hiding?
You stubborn thing.
Be honestyou wish you were born with talent running through your veins.
Just like... this.
Wh-What the?!
D-Diana?
Oh, Diana.
The program you submitted for the Samhain Festival is impressively thorough.
U-Um...
Let's hold a meeting to discuss it.
Ow! The pain!
My stomach...
Oh, are you unwell?
PleasePlease excuse me...
Oh, the pain...
Little Witch Academia
Little Witch Academia
Why? Why did this happen?!
Diana!
Diana!
We're in a bit of a pinch.
We can't figure out how to read the summoning spell by ourselves.
It's the one on this page.
Please, teach us!
W-Well...
D-Diana?
What a fine mess we are in.
Now that you two have laid eyes on this spell...
You are already under its curse.
Curse?!
If nothing is done, you will become eighty-two years old within twenty-four hours!
Eighty-two...
N-No!
Save us, Diana!
Place both of your hands atop your head.
L-Like this?
Yes, very good. Now then...
Allow me to write the curse-breaking spell!
That should do it.
Now stay like that until tomorrow morning, and the curse will be lifted.
Just don't move until tomorrow morning?
Got it!
Bye, I have other business to attend to.
Thank you, Diana!
You're our savior!
Oh crap!
Well, if it isn't Lady Diana. Please forgive me.
I have just completed my cleaning of your room.
Oh, Diana's room must be this way.
Lady Diana.
Were you not returning to your room?
Y-Yes, I was! I was just on my way there now.
Too close, too close!
So this is where Diana and them live.
But sneaking into someone else's room is definitely crossing a line.
Lady Diana.
I forgot to pass on a message for you.
As I was cleaning, your classmates came by in a rush, looking for you.
I-I see. Thank you for telling me.
Goodbye.
Thank you again.
Just give me a break... huh?
Whoa...
Is this Diana's... diary?
No, stop! I definitely can't look at this!
Diana?
Y-Yes?!
I could hear her voice.
She must be back!
We're coming in.
Diana.
We need your help.
And how can I be of service?
We managed to get the statue of Great Witch Jennifer out here, but Professor told us to change her pose.
We want to use life-breathing magic on it, but it's too hard for us.
You're our only hope.
L-Leave all your hopes in these capable hands of mine!
Th-There is not a thing that I cannot possibly do!
Thanks, Diana!
Stand back, everyone!
I-I can make this work! I've been practicing metamorphosis magic every day!
Th-This is nothing.
Ansolew Aroae!
Ansolew Aroae! Ansolew Aroae!
What's wrong with Diana?
Maybe she's having a bad day.
Isn't that the wrong spell?
Um...
Ansolew Airo!
Akko?!
H-Huh? I'm back?
Th-There's a very good reason behind this...
This was the work of the mirror, I presume. It's easy to imagine.
Diana!
More importantly, I just had a meeting with Lotte and Sucy about your sacrifice duty.
Were you really so irresponsible as to forget?
S-Sorry. I just can't get on board with being a sacrifice.
And you think that justifies your pointless prank?
Whenever something doesn't go your way, you sulk and lose all motivation.
You play at being Chariot without the slightest knowledge of the history or tradition of magic.
You have no right to learn at this academy!
I am motivated! I'm serious about following in Chariot's footsteps!
Serious? You are?
I'll prove it to you.
That my passion for magic is the real deal!
Kagari Atsuko will be chosen as the Moonlit Witch during the Samhain Festival!
What's with her?
Who knows.
Diana sure is amazing.
This world was once abundant with the power of good magic.
In our current era, however, magic is ever dwindling.
I plan to seek the ultimate power of the Grand Triskelion to revitalize magic once more.
And what am I, compared to her?!
I heard you claimed that you'd become the Moonlit Witch in front of everyone.
Professor Ursula.
It just came out...
Even though I have zero chance of winning...
Zero?
I don't want to admit it, but everyone's right.
Diana is amazing.
She's more mature than I can even imagine being, and it's like she lives in a totally different world.
When I put myself next to her, all I see is a little kid.
Akko, it's true that you have a tendency to leap before you look that you should consider fixing.
But you know, I bet that even Chariot failed and worried and got discouraged more than you'd expect.
What would Chariot do?
The Big Dipper is so pretty.
Twinkling past the far edge of it is the North StarPolaris.
Professor Ursula?
Don't compare yourself to others. Do what only you can do.
Watch over this for her.
O-Okay.
Profes
Have a good night.
What only I can do...
This light...
Isn't this...
Just like back then, it's the Fountain of Polaris.
Tell me what only I can do.
Chariot!
You came!
This is from when someone was watching Chariot...
What happened? You're covered in dirt.
What am I to do with you?
Watch me!
Chariot looks like she's having so much fun.
I can feel power in my heart when I say this chant!
Arae Aryrha!
H-Huh?
I'm getting dizzy!
Geez... here.
Arae Aryrha!
Open your heart!
Chariot is so great.
Laugh with me!
Arae Aryrha!
Could it be that Chariot wasn't practicing to become the Moonlit Witch?
It was more pure...
Arae Aryrha...
Huh? A spell?
The staff...
That's it! This is what I can do!
