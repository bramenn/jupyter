Whaaat? So lame!
Is that the end of Act 1?
For Tenorio's big guns, that was pretty meh.
Well, I hear the next one is the real deal.
Then I guess we can look forward to Act 2!
Decisions and Duels
I-I'm so sorry...
For not being able to swim...
No, I'm the one who should be apologizing.
Dragging you into this...
No, no...
Still, they sure are huge.
Something wrong?
I-I-I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
No, no... By huge, I meant this ballast area...
Toudou!
What's this?
That dragon... it seems just like the little ones aboveground.
Meaning that this really isn't any time to complain, huh?
A-Are you all right?
Yeah, uh-huh. I'm totally fine, but...
we're kind of in a sticky situation here, huh?
Um, if I'm hindering you, then please let go of me!
If you should get hurt because of me, Amagiri-senpai... I... I...
Huh? Toudou?
I can't take it any more.
Someone else paying the price because of the likes of me!
It's all right.
You don't have to worry about a thing.
But... but!
Normally, you'd mop up the floor with an opponent like that, right?
So wouldn't it only be fair to believe in me a little more,
since I put up a good fight against you?
But that's...
One more thing...
Don't ever say the likes of me again.
You're so gentle and strong... a lovely young girl, Toudou.
Right!
Right, okay.
Go on up.
Okay!
So it's just like the ones up there.
Toudou, can you get a read on that thing's Prana flow?
Yes. I mean, it's a little vague.
It seems to be constantly moving inside him.
I see.
Then I guess my only option is to give it a try.
Give it a try?
Yeah. Till now, I never had a Lux that could withstand my Prana.
But I bet this one can!
Amazing...
Amagiri-senpai...
Seems like...
Amagiri-senpai!
Are you all right?
Amagiri-senpai? Amagiri-senpai!
So you're only able to fight at full throttle up to five minutes or so, Amagiri-senpai?
Yeah.
If I really push it, I think I can go a little longer.
Um, Amagiri-senpai...
why would you go that far to fight?
There's someone I want to help out.
Do you mean Riessfeld-senpai?
Well... yeah.
So of course... uh... um... Amagiri-senpai...
you're in love with Riessfeld-senpai, after all?
Huh? Well, sure, as a person I do admire her... but see...
But... then... uh...
No, I apologize for asking a silly question like that.
Uh... right...
In that case, I still have a...
Huh? What?
No... Nothing!
Anyway, isn't the rescue squad taking a long time to get here?
Uh...
Can I ask you something now?
Oh, yes!
Why are you fighting here, Toudou?
Because I want to save my father who's being detained as a criminal.
Five years ago, someone broke into a shop my father and I happened to be in.
And in trying to save me when I was taken hostage...
My father...
ended up killing him.
Normally, he would've gotten off for self-defense,
but my father was a Genestella.
I see.
So the charges were more serious.
Yes. But looking back now, even at age eight, I could've taken the kidnapper out myself.
But I was a coward, and I just froze.
Unless I do something, my father won't be released for several decades.
That was when my uncle told me there was just one way to save him.
And that's why you came to Asterisk?
I no longer have any choice but to throw myself at my uncle's mercy.
As long as I do what he says, I have nothing to...
You're wrong about that.
Wrong?
That's not the path you chose yourself.
If you go on like this, sooner or later you'll hit a brick wall.
Well, to be honest, I only just realized that myself.
But me, on my own? I can't possibly...
There's just no way...
You'll be fine.
You're not alone, Toudou.
At the very least, you have me to help you out.
As long as it's a path that you've chosen yourself, that is.
That I've chosen myself...
S-S-Sorry!
No, no, I'm the one who should be sorry!
Uh...
You know how you stroke my head a lot, Amagiri-senpai?
Oh, I guess you don't like that?
Oh, no...
My father used to stroke my head just like that, too.
I see.
Someone down there?
We need help!
For God's sake, don't make me worry so much.
I'm very sorry, Uncle.
Never mind. Anyway, about your next opponent...
Before you go any further, may I ask you something?
What is it?
Just now, you said that you were worried about me...
But were you worried about Kirin Toudou?
Or Kirin Toudou, a mere tool in your hands?
All I need from you is your power, nothing else.
Come to think of it, you were just with that Ser Veresta wielder, weren't you?
I hear he recently caused some kind of row with Allekant.
It would be a hassle if he dragged you into any unnecessary trouble.
Don't have anything more to do with him!
That I refuse.
What did you say?!
Amagiri-senpai taught me something very valuable.
And I believe that there's still a lot that I should learn from him.
That's a load of crap.
All you need to do is exactly what I tell you to!
No, I
Do you dare defy me?!
Who do you think made you Rank 1?!
You think Asterisk's a joke?!
Without my help, you don't stand a chance in hell of winning a Festa!
Yes, that's probably beyond me.
Then shut up and just do what I say!
Don't you want to save your father as soon as possible?!
But neither do I think that I can accomplish that your way, Uncle.
Don't be such a smartass, you little brat!
I'm sorry, Uncle.
I am grateful to you for all your help.
But I've made up my mind to fight my own way.
Otherwise, I'll...
I'm sure I'll regret it someday.
Come back here!
How do you think you're going to get along on your own?!
Right, let's see...
First, I think I'll take someone on in a duel.
An opponent of my own choosing...
That's right.
This time, the decision will be mine.
Amagiri-senpai?
Thank you very much for complying with my ill-mannered request.
Sure, it's all good, but...
why a duel with me, of all things?
Because I felt that it was absolutely necessary for me to take my true first step here.
True first step?
Yes.
Gotcha.
But if we're gonna do this, then I'm going all-out, okay?
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Well, not like I didn't go all-out last time, either.
You're not going to use that Ogre Lux?
Well, I can't keep up with your speed using the Ser Veresta.
If I lose the same way, no way is Julis going to forgive me.
I've got to make some adjustments.
I'll be looking forward to that!
Surely they didn't have to go out of their way to provide such a stage.
Oh, but this is a must-see match, so why wouldn't they?
Even still...!
Don't worry so much, Riessfeld.
Toudou is formidable.
In terms of just sword skills, she might be a cut above Ayato.
In that case...
It's all good.
Ayato's taken on a way more powerful opponent before.
What's that? Who are you talking about?
Haru-nee... Ayato's older sister.
Older sister?
Well, the guy does seem to have some kind of plan.
What do you know about it?
He asked me to lend him a Lux. That's all.
So he asked you, too?
Meaning that he asked you, too?
Well, yeah.
Hey, it's about to start, I think.
Start of the duel!
Here goes!
Just as I expected of you, Amagiri-senpai.
That was like thrusting against thick steel.
Well, the one thing I'm sure about is the amount of my Prana.
Not only that, but... that's the first time anyone's evaded my Conjoined Cranes.
I see, so that was Conjoined Cranes?
NESTING STATE
Nesting State.
CITRUS BLOOM
Citrus Bloom.
SIDE-BY-SIDE WINGS
Side-by-side Wings.
BLUE SEA WAVE
Blue Sea Wave...
The Toudou Style boasts 49 different conjoined skills,
and combining them results in the foolproof multi-hit attack...
The Conjoined Cranes.
The Conjoined Cranes are invincible.
This time, I will finish you off!
All right, then, I guess I'll respond to that by going all-out!
Now's my chance!
His Meteo arts failed?
Amagiri Shinmei-style Spear Skill - Ninth Cloud Wasp!
AMAGIRI SHINMEI-STYLE SPEAR SKILL - NINTH CLOUD WASP
Spear Skills?
Did I surprise you at least a little?
Yes, you did. But...
a tricky move for a tricky move!
No way!
The more tricky moves you've got, the trickier it gets!
Amagiri Shinmei-style Short Sword Technique...
Reaper!
I win!
Amagiri Shinmei-style Grappling Skill...
Purifying Sweep!
Are you okay, Toudou?
Well, you got me.
Both the shield and the short sword were decoys, then?
I surrender.
I've been soundly defeated.
End of duel! Winner...
AYATO AMAGIRI
Ayato Amagiri!
Who knew that you'd really win?
Congratulations, Ayato. You were so cool!
Hey, thanks.
Ayato? May I come in?
Sure.
Pardon me for the intrusion.
Come on in.
Uh, um... excuse me.
Huh? You, too, Toudou?
Yes. It seems that she has some business here today.
Uh, um...
Would you mind letting me join your practice sessions?
Y-You see, Amagiri-senpai invited me before...
But at the time, I had to decline.
Well, that's news to me!
Well, hey...
but look, if someone of Toudou's caliber joined us,
that would give us a range of options, right?
Well, you do have a point, but...
Sure, I don't mind. Bring it on!
Why did you decide on your own?!
And come to think of it, you've been infiltrating our practice sessions day after day yourself!
Riessfeld, you're such a nitpicker.
Little by little is the way of the world. Just give it up.
That's what you call usurping, you idiot!
So this is our lineup, but are you still game?
Yes! Of course!
Gotcha. Then...
Kirin! I know you're in there!
Come out of there, Kirin!
Dammit, open this door!
Kirin, what kind of an idiot are you?!
After dueling someone without my permission,
you end up losing in such a humiliating manner!
But it's clear to you now, isn't it?!
You need my assistance!
I'm sorry, Uncle.
But I've made up my mind to fight my way from now on...
Shut up, shut up!
All you need to do is obey my every order!
She's already taken the first step with her own two feet.
You have no business butting in anymore.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
I'm not a Genestella, you know!
That's right! You sure about this, Kirin?
I'm the one who covered up your father's deeds!
If you refuse to come back to me, I'll spread the word on everything!
Oh, my, what an intriguing thing to say.
What the... E-Enfield...
I have no intention of meddling in your relationship with Kirin Toudou.
But she is also a student at Seidoukan Academy.
Not only does that make her an asset to this school,
but also to the Integrated Enterprise Foundation.
And if you intend to corrupt her with your self-interest in mind...
I can ill afford to look the other way.
I'm sure my mother would make the same judgment.
U-Uncle!
I appreciate what you've done for me. That's the truth!
If it hadn't been for you, I never would've come to Asterisk,
and I wouldn't have met these people.
And so... for all you've done... all you've done till now...
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
Uncle...
I'm looking forward to training with you, Toudou.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Um... Amagiri-senpai?
What's up?
Uh... there's something...
no, I mean two favors I'd like to ask of you...
Favors?
If possible, uh...
I'd like to call you by your first name, Amagiri-senpai...
Oh, is that all? Sure, of course you can.
So what's the other thing?
Okay! Then, uh...
A-Ayato-senpai...
Right.
W-Will you please...
call me by my first name, too?
Okay, then, Kirin-chan.
Yes!
All right, want to join us next time we practice?
Yes! I'd like that!
Dammit!
I only agreed to do this because you said it was a puppet test!
You never said we'd have to fight something like this!
So anyway, that's the deal, more or less.
So I guess our victory isn't just a pipe dream.
Of course not! As if I was gunning for anything less from the start!
And I was able to nab some data on that young swordsman - our only red flag.
This was so incredible!
I mean, it's enough to make me drool!
The Tenorio Faction will have lost face with this failure...
And you've acquired this data without having to go after it yourself,
so it's killing two birds with one stone, eh?
Now then, Seidoukan Academy and everyone in Tenorio,
I thank you for exerting yourselves in so many ways for my sake!
And now, the curtain will go up for the main attraction.
Please stay with us till the very end!
Oh, is that you, Sasamiya-san?
You surprised me.
Toudou?
Yes?
I heard that you're fighting for your father's sake. Is that true?
Well, yes, it is.
I see. That's admirable.
Really admirable.
Actually, so am I. I'm fighting for my father.
Is that right?
Which brings me to my proposal...
P-Proposal?
Want to...
team up with me?
That's my Ayato!
Attaining the rank of 1 so soon after transferring in!
It's all according to plan.
Episode 8 - A Holiday for Two, Part 2
Now, if only Ms. Toudou and Ms. Sasamiya would team up for real,
life would be beautiful!
