Kill... the Symbol of Peace.
Nice to meet you.
We are the League of Villains.
It may be presumptuous of us
but we have invited ourselves in to the home of the heroes, U.A. High School
in order to have All Might, the Symbol of Peace, take his last breath.
Everyone...!
Idiots!
He can erase Quirks just by looking at them!
It's a Eraser Head!
Class rep!
Yes?
I entrust this duty to you.
Run to the school and tell them about what is happening here.
But it would be a disgrace as class rep to leave everyone behind
Use your Quirk in order to save others!
Black Hole!
What do you mean, fight?
Are you stupid?!
This is the only way...
Delaware Smash!
Even I...
Even I can...!
Move!
Get away!
You too!
You're in my way!
I guess...
You're both amazing!
Bastard, get off!
I had a bowel movement this morning, so those things will stick all day.
We were lucky that was all of them.
I took a huge gamble.
Normally, they would have kept some people underwater in reserve.
I was trying to keep my composure, but I couldn't stay calm.
Midoriya, stop that.
This is dangerous, I have to be more careful...
It's scary.
Rather than reflecting back, shouldn't you think about what to do next?
Y-You're right.
Are you all right?
Y-Yeah.
Anyway, we should make getting help our top priority.
It would be best to follow the shore
and avoid the central plaza as we head toward the exit.
That's true.
Mr. Aizawa has drawn a large number of villains to the plaza.
But... there are too many villains.
Of course, Mr. Aizawa is trying to suppress them...
Wait, Midoriya, don't tell me you...
Stupid, stupid, stupid!
I'm not thinking of doing anything that'll get in his way.
But... if we can just find an opening and lessen Mr. Aizawa's load, even a little...
We had our first win in our first battle.
That was where we were mistaken.
We were under the illusion that our powers could actually work against the enemy.
Scatter you and kill you, huh?
I hate to say this...
Th-This guy...
The instant we warped here...
Is he really a kid?
O-Ow...
Where is he?
I went through the trouble of bringing this whole crowd, too...
Killing All Might...
At first glance, I thought they had gathered all their elite
and would overpower him by numbers...
From what I saw, there were only four or five truly dangerous people.
If that's the case, then the next step I should take is...
Hey, at this rate, your cells will slowly die.
I want to be a hero.
I would like to avoid something so cruel if possible.
On what basis do you think you can kill All Might?
What's your plan?
Scary! Seriously, did you see that just now?!
I saw the River Styx, seriously!
What the heck is up with these guys?!
What's going on?!
Worry about that later.
Right now, we need to figure out how we'll get away from all these people.
Then give me a weapon, too!
You're the electric guy, aren't you?
Hurry up and take care of them!
You saw during the combat training, didn't you?!
We were paired up!
I can only cover myself with electricity!
I can discharge electricity, but it's not like I can control it!
I'll hit you two, too!
It's like, you know, the same as Todoroki!
Even if we wanted to call for help, there's interference jammin' the signal.
Listen, you two!
Right now, you can't count on me!
I'm counting on you!
You're a guy, stop whining.
Then, I'll use you as a human stun gun!
Seriously?! Idiot!
Oh, it's working.
I'm strong!
You two can count on me!
Hey, you're too happy-go-lucky.
Stop messing around, kid!
Both of you should take this more seriously.
Sorry, I thought it was a good idea at the time.
Jirou Kyouka!
Quirk: Earphone Jack!
She can amplify and send her own explosively loud heartbeats by inserting her plugs.
She can also catch very quiet sounds and stuff!
Kaminari, you should have requested something to help you aim in your costume order!
Done!
Huh?!
It takes some time...
A sheet?
Is it supposed to be a shield?
It's an insulation sheet 100 millimeters thick.
Kaminari.
I see.
In that case I can be...
Now then, I am worried about the others.
Let us join them quickly.
Wait, your clothes got super punk!
I can make them again!
Yaoyorozu Momo.
Quirk: Creation!
She can create any non-living thing!
What makes this possible
is her vast knowledge and understanding of the molecular structure of materials!
Violent growth...
Kaminari, don't look this way!
Kaminari Denki.
Quirk: Electrification!
When he goes over his watt limit, his brain short circuits,
and he becomes a huge idiot for a while!
Hey, Midoriya, we're just here to see how things are going, okay?
Ribbit...
I know.
We'll run away the instant it seems dangerous.
23 seconds.
The last boss?!
24 seconds.
20 seconds.
17 seconds.
Ribbit?
Damn.
It's hard to see because you keep moving around...
That's when you have finished an action.
And the space in between has gotten shorter and shorter.
Don't push yourself, Eraser Head.
My elbow's crumbling!
That Quirk isn't suited for fighting long fights against a large group, is it?
Isn't this too different from your usual job?
What you're good at...
Even so, you jumped right in to fight us from the front.
Was that to put your students at ease?
You're so cool...
You're so cool...!
By the way, hero...
Mr. Aizawa...
Black Hole, which sucks up everything and turns it all to dust.
I see.
That is an astounding Quirk.
However, Thirteen, you are a hero who works to rescue people from disasters.
As expected...
A warp gate!
You turned yourself into dust.
H-He got me...
Teacher!
Iida, run!
Hurry!
Use your Quirk in order to save others!
Damn it...!
One of the children who was not scattered...
We are only waiting for All Might.
If the other teachers are called here, it will be hard for us!
Everyone...
The whole class...
I will...!
Go!
Hurry!
Everyone... wait for me!
You impertinent
I will not allow you to go outside!
An automatic door!
Should I kick it down?!
Is it a thickness I can kick down?!
You're impudent, four-eyes.
Be gone!
Villains.
The world of pros.
We still hadn't...
I'll tell you, Eraser Head.
He's the anti-Symbol of Peace, the bioengineered Nomu.
Die...!
Is this all of them?
They're so weak.
All right.
Let's hurry up and go save the others!
If we're here, then everyone else should be inside USJ, too.
I'm worried about the guys with less offensive ability!
Besides, because we ran off ahead, we slowed Thirteen down.
If Thirteen had been able to suck up that fog,
then this wouldn't have happened!
As men, we have to take responsibility for what we did!
If you want to go, then go by yourself.
I'm gonna kill that warp gate.
Huh?
You're gonna act childish at a time like this?
Besides, that guy's attacks are!
Shut up!
That gate bastard is the enemy's way in and out.
I'm gonna cut off their getaway route for when the time comes.
It's not like we don't have a way to fight the fog.
Stop your chit-chatting!
Since you have left your guard down!
Anyway...
That reaction time was amazing...
Anyway, were you always so calm and rational?
I thought you were more like
Die! Die! Die!
I'm always calm and rational, you spiky-haired punk!
Oh yeah, that's more like it.
Then go if you want to!
Wait, wait!
Believing in our friends!
That's real manly, Bakugou!
I'll follow you!
Damn it!
He's too fast!
I see'im! Over there!
First, I need to make sure I'm not caught by the enemy.
Found you!
That makes six.
If we can just reduce enemy numbers little by little...
You're being impudent, four-eyes.
Be gone!
I don't know the theory behind it, but if he's wearing something like this...
Go, Iida!
My body!
Oh, no!
However!
I won't let you!
Go...!
Engine Boost!
He's going to call for support.
It's game over.
You can erase Quirks.
That's wonderful, but it's nothing impressive.
In the face of overwhelming power...
It's like he's breaking a twig...
I'm sure I erased his Quirk.
That means he is just that strong.
He's as strong as All Might...
M-M-Midoriya, I can't take it anymore.
I'm sure you must be having second thoughts, right?
Ribbit...
Shigaraki Tomura.
Kurogiri, did you kill Thirteen?
I put Thirteen out of action, but there were students that I was unable to disperse...
Huh?
Kurogiri... you...!
If you weren't a warp gate, I would have crushed you to pieces!
We can't win against dozens of pros.
It's game over.
Man, it's game over this time.
Let's go home.
They're going home?
Did he say they're going home?
That's what I heard.
A-All right!
We're saved!
Yes, but...
I have a bad feeling about this, Midoriya.
Yeah.
For them to simply retreat after doing all this...
Don't they want to kill All Might?
If they leave like this, U.A. will just beef up their security.
Game over?
What is it?
What are those guys planning?
Oh, yeah.
Before we leave,
let's smash some of his pride as the Symbol of Peace!
Tch.
You really are cool...
Crap, crap, crap, crap!
He's clearly different from our earlier opponents!
I've gotta save Asui and run away!
Let go of her!
Smash...!
My arm's not broken?!
I'm finally able to control my power at a time like this?
I did it!
I was able to get in a good smash!
All right!
When in the world...
Wait, it didn't... hurt him...?
Don't you think they are trying so hard because they have a way to kill him?
No way...
You move well.
Your Smash
Are you a follower of All Might's?
Oh well.
I'm done with you.
Ribbit!
It's fine now.
I am here!
All Might!
Ribbit...
All... Might...
Ah...
It's fine now.
I am here!
Next time, All Might.
As you can see, they will keep going after my weakness!
Go beyond!
Plus Ultra!
Plus Ultra!
