It's eating the Angel?
Those bindings were what allowed us to control the Eva's power.
But now the Eva is removing the web that binds it to our will.
Unit 01's been awakened and set free.
SEELE won't stay quiet for this.
The Eva series aren't capable of generating S2 organs themselves.
But we never imagined it'd be able to take one into itself this way.
This incident is at extreme odds with the scenario SEELE created.
It will not be easy to correct this.
It was a mistake to entrust NERV to Gendo Ikari, wasn't it?
But he was the only one who could achieve this project's goals.
Ikari, what's going on in your mind?
It's begun, hasn't it?
Yes, this is the beginning.
Damage on both Evas
is over the Henflick limit, beyond any normal restoration.
It may be a while before we can restore everything to normal.
Fortunately, the MAGI system can be transferred to a new location.
We may be able to start working tomorrow.
But this place will have to be scrapped.
It's just a matter of time before the brass decides to abandon it.
That's true.
For the time being, we'll have to use the Secondary Control Center.
You mean, without the MAGI?
That's right.
We can clean the dust off, and be working again by this afternoon.
But those chairs are cramped, and the sensors don't operate well.
It's difficult to work there.
But at least the layout is the same as our original control center.
It just feels like we don't belong there.
At least we have an alternative.
We have no choice when it comes to using Unit 01.
It may be restrained by the cage, but are you sure it's safe?
No heat emissions, free electrons, electromagnetic fields
or chemical reactions are being detected.
The S2 unit is completely inactive.
Nevertheless, on three separate occasions,
Unit 01 has moved without power.
You can't judge this situation
just by the things you can see and measure.
Yeah, we can't take any chances, that's for sure.
It's as unpredictable as you are, Katsuragi.
I'm sorry.
However, our concerns are not limited to Unit 01.
Correct. Serious damage was sustained by Units 00 and 02.
Headquarters was partially ruined, exposing Central Dogma.
The destruction was enormous.
We can't even estimate how much money and time have been lost.
This all is because we didn't put a bell around Ikari's neck.
A bell was there, but it didn't ring.
A bell that doesn't ring serves no purpose.
We'll make sure the bell works next time.
My, my, what an unexpected situation!
The committee... I mean, how will you explain this to SEELE?
Unit 01 wasn't under our control.
This was an accident.
Unit 01 will stay frozen until the Committee gives us further orders.
That's a very appropriate decision.
However, isn't your son still trapped inside it?
It's hopeless. It's not accepting the code to eject the entry plug.
What about the backup codes?
Also refused. Even a direct circuit isn't getting through.
The plug's video monitor is active though.
Switching to main screen.
What in the hell is this?
I'd say that's the truth behind a 400 synch ratio.
I can't believe it. What happened to Shinji?
Apparently the Eva has taken him into itself.
What does that mean?! Just what is an Eva?!
It is something created by man in Man's own image.
I really can't describe it any other way.
You didn't create anything!
You just copied something you found in the Antarctic.
What was the original? That's what I want to know, Doctor.
This is not just a copy. A human will is inside it.
Are you saying somebody willed this to happen?!
No, the Eva did.
Do something, damn you!
You created this, didn't you?! Take responsibility for it!
I am still alive.
I know that Wonder Girl is still alive!
Why are you bothering me with trivial crap like that, Misato?!
I can't believe it. I couldn't do anything.
I can't believe that stupid Shinji outperformed me.
Not again!
What do you mean, you're going to salvage Shinji?
Well, theoretically, Shinji's life force still exists in there.
And you'll be respecting that life this time?
Losing Shinji is out of the question now.
I don't know.
What NERV wants is Unit 01 as their tool, not Shinji.
I don't deny it.
Our assumption is that Shinji's body lost its Ego Border,
and he's floating in the entry plug in quantum form.
You're saying that Shinji has shifted into a form we can't see?
Yes, the LCL has chemically altered
into something very similar to the sea water of primitive Earth.
You mean, like a primordial soup?
All of the substances which composed Shinji
are still preserved in the plug,
and his soul exists there as well.
In fact, his Ego Image is giving a sort of substance to his plug suit.
In other words, this salvage operation
must both reconstruct his body and fix his soul in it.
Is that possible?
With the Magi's support, yes.
This is all theoretical, isn't it?
You won't know what will really happen until you do it.
What is this?
Where am I?
In the entry plug?
That's right. But there's nobody here. Not even myself.
What is this? What is this? What is this?
I don't understand.
These people...
Yes, they're people I know, people who know me.
I understand now. This is my world.
What is this?
This is supposed to be my world, but this I don't understand.
An image from outside?
A hostile image?
That's right! The enemy!
Enemy! Enemy! Enemy! Enemy!
Our enemies are called Angels. They have the names of Angels.
They are the targets of Eva and NERV.
This is our revenge for the death of Misato's father!
Why do I fight? Despite all the pain and suffering?
What are you, stupid?
An unknown enemy is attacking, of course we have to fight them!
Am I odd to try to find a reason to fight?
Am I not supposed to think about it?
Enemy! Enemy! Enemy! Enemy!
All are my enemies!
Us... That which threatens us is the enemy.
Of course, how can I be faulted
for protecting my own life and those of others?!
Enemy! Enemy! Enemy! Enemy!
My enemy! My enemy!
Damn! Damn! Damn!
You hurt Toji and killed my mother! Father!
Why do you hate your father?
Anyone would hate such a father!
You don't understand him, do you?
Of course not. I've hardly ever seen him.
Is that why you hate him?
Yes, my father doesn't need me! My father deserted me!
And am I his substitute?
Yes, it must be so!
He abandoned me because he had Ayanami!
As if you didn't run away all by yourself.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
It's all his fault!!
That time I was actually going to tell him I hate him!
Did you tell me to pilot this just to make me suffer, Father?
Correct.
That can't be true! It can't be! How can you say that?!
You don't need me, do you?!
I called you because you had a use.
Why me?
Because there was no one else who could.
No way, I've never seen this before. It's impossible!
Yes, I knew it was true.
It's true! I knew Eva.
Then I escaped!
I really escaped! Leaving my father and mother behind!
Concentration of LCL is currently stable at 36.
No problem with oxygen concentration.
Electromagnetic radiation pulse is normal. Wave pattern is 0.
Counters are functioning normally.
Salvage Plan Guideline and Procedures...
It's amazing that you could create all this in only one month.
Thanks for giving me credit, but it wasn't my idea.
This was already experimental ten years ago.
This kind of thing happened during the development?
It was before I worked here.
My mother was here, though. I only know the data.
And how did it come out?
I've heard they failed.
Kindness...
Warmth...
Is this the warmth of a human?
I was never aware of it.
What is loneliness?
I was never aware of it, but now I think I know it.
What is happiness?
I was never aware of it, but now I think I know it.
Are others kind to you?
Why?
Because I am Eva's pilot.
Because I pilot Eva, they treat me well.
That is the reason I can exist.
That is the everything to support my reason to be.
So, I must pilot Eva.
And then?
Enemy! Yes, I must fight what they all call the enemy!
And then?
And I must win!
Right, I can't lose.
As they tell me to, I must pilot Eva.
As they tell me to, I must win!
Otherwise...
Nobody...
Nobody...
Nobody...
Do your best.
Do your best.
Get to work, idiot.
Do your best.
Do your best.
Good work, Shinji.
Misato, Ritsuko, Asuka, Toji, Kensuke
and Father.
They all respect me.
When I pilot Eva, they all respect me.
They respect this worthless being. Everyone says to pilot this.
I'll prove to my dad I'm worthwhile.
Do your best.
Yes, I'm doing my best.
I am doing my best!
Somebody be nice to me.
I fought so hard. I'm doing my best!
Treat me well! Be nice to me!
I'm nice to you.
Tell me, Shinji, do you want to become one with me?
To be of one mind and body?
It could be very, very nice.
Ask me anytime. I'm ready.
Hey, Shinji-idiot, don't you want to be one with me?
To be of one mind and body?
It could be very, very nice.
You ought to appreciate your good fortune. Come on.
Ikari, do you want to become one with me?
To be of one mind and body?
It could be very, very nice.
Ikari?
Do you want to become one with me?
To be of one mind and body?
It could be very, very nice.
Relax and release your soul.
All investigative needles fixed.
Fixed at electromagnetic radius of zero minus three.
Ego Border pulse connection is complete.
Roger. Start salvage.
Roger, transmitting first signal.
Eva has received the signal. No rejection confirmed.
Proceeding to second and third signals.
Subject cathexis is normal.
Destrudo is not confirmed.
Roger, shift the subject to stage two.
Shinji!
Hey, Shinji-idiot!
Shinji!
Hey, Shinji!
Yo, Shinji!
Ikari...
Shinji!
Shinji-idiot!
Shinji!
Hey, Shinji!
Yo, Shinji.
Ikari...
Shinji!
Shinji-idiot!
Shinji!
Hey, Shinji!
Yo, Shinji.
Ikari...
Shinji!
Shinji-idiot!
Shinji!
Hey, Shinji!
Yo, Shinji.
Ikari...
It's no good. The Ego Border is frozen in a loop.
Irradiate the wave patterns in all directions.
It won't work. The signals are trapped in Klein space.
What does that mean?
It means we failed.
Abort intervention. Reverse tangent plug.
Return additions to zero.
Yes, Ma'am.
Destrudo reaction in the old area. Pattern sepia.
Destrudo reaction in the old area. Pattern sepia.
A change is confirmed on the core pulse too! Plus 0.3 is confirmed!
Maintenance of the status quo is top priority. Prevent back flow.
Yes, Ma'am.
Plus 0.5... 0.8... This is odd. I can't stop it!
What is this? Why? Don't you want to come back, Shinji?
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
What do you wish?
What do you wish?
What do you wish?
What do you wish?
Eva has rejected the signal.
LCL self-replenishment is dropping.
Pressure in the plug is increasing!
Abort all operations. Cut the power.
It's not working. The plug is being ejected.
Shinji!
Where am I? Inside of Eva?
Inside of Eva?
Did I pilot Eva again? Why?
You won't pilot the Eva anymore?
I've decided I will never pilot Eva again.
But you have just piloted Evangelion Unit 01.
Shinji, you are here because you have piloted the Eva.
Piloting the Eva has created your present.
You can never deny your past, Shinji,
nor can you deny that you did indeed pilot it once more.
That which is, is. It's true.
I just wanted to tell you that only you can decide.
It's your future.
What good is damned science? It can't even save one small life?!
Give me back my Shinji! Give him back!
That scent?
A human smell?
Misato?
Ayanami?
No, not them.
That's right.
This is the smell of my mother.
Second Impact has occurred. Will he live in this hell?
Anywhere can be heaven if you try to live.
Because he has a life,
as long as he lives, he will have the chance to attain happiness.
Yes, you're right.
Mom...
Have you decided yet?
If it's a boy, Shinji. If it's a girl, I'll name the baby Rei.
Shinji... Rei...
Mom...
Shinji!
Let's speak of what psychologists used to call the Oral Stage.
Unit 01 will be restored in two days. Let's speak of what psychologists used to call the Oral Stage.
Even given divine power, humans still... Let's speak of what psychologists used to call the Oral Stage.
Even given divine power, humans still... It's when someone is dependent on another, like his mother.
I can hardly agree. It's when someone is dependent on another, like his mother.
I can hardly agree. I know a lot of guys like that, and your letter sounds just like them.
Speaking of which, the committee is considering freezing Eva. I know a lot of guys like that, and your letter sounds just like them.
I know a lot of guys like that, and your letter sounds just like them.
The Evangelion android... I know a lot of guys like that, and your letter sounds just like them.
The Evangelion android... I feel sorry for your girlfriend. She can't be your mate and mother.
I feel sorry for your girlfriend. She can't be your mate and mother.
It's man-made, but who knows what lurks inside that black box? I feel sorry for your girlfriend. She can't be your mate and mother.
I feel sorry for your girlfriend. She can't be your mate and mother.
Well, I'm just glad Shinji was saved. Maybe your sister, too? Aren't you just taking advantage of her?
Maybe your sister, too? Aren't you just taking advantage of her?
That wasn't me. It was you, probably. Maybe your sister, too? Aren't you just taking advantage of her?
That wasn't me. It was you, probably. Well, maybe that's mean. Girls are sensitive to how they're loved.
Well, maybe that's mean. Girls are sensitive to how they're loved.
Why don't we go to a bar tonight? Well, maybe that's mean. Girls are sensitive to how they're loved.
Why don't we go to a bar tonight? So she's already been aware that you want her as your mother.
So she's already been aware that you want her as your mother.
Sorry, I've got to go somewhere. So she's already been aware that you want her as your mother.
So she's already been aware that you want her as your mother.
I see. So she's already been aware that you want her as your mother.
I see.
See you!
Seeing her man as soon as Shinji is saved?
Well, I can't criticize her.
Ritsuko must be thinking I'm pretty disgusting.
Appearing to give in to our desires looks more human.
We might even fool them.
Fool the Intelligence Department?
Or the Commander and Ritsuko?
Or me?
No, I meant myself.
You want to fool the others?
You never show interest in others, but you want their attention.
You really are just like my dad.
A cigarette? I didn't know you still smoked.
I only smoke after this sort of thing.
So nobody knows but you.
I see. I'm honored.
And how's Instrumentality going?
Adam could wipe out mankind.
Why is it being kept there?
Did you come to see me just to learn that?
Well, that's one of the reasons.
It would be my honor to be used as my lady's cat's-paw,
but I can't tell you right now.
I just want you to know what I want.
What are NERV and Commander Ikari really planning?
I'd like to know that myself.
Hey, you can't dodge my questions by doing that.
Hey, no!
Don't put strange things in there!
I can't believe this. What is it?
A present for you, the first in eight years.
And maybe the last as well.
To be continued...
