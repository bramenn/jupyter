You did a great job.
Thank you.
Keep it up.
Roger that.
Ms. Machiko?
Hold on.
I'm trying to think of the right words to say.
Huh?
Your grades aside,
you still haven't submitted your post-graduation plans to me.
Oh...
Don't tell me you still haven't decided?
Actually, I...
It's your future.
It's about time you decided what you're going to do.
I know that.
In that case...
Bring it to me tomorrow!

that we are misunderstood
That was a double whammy, wasn't it, Madoka?
Your report card and post-graduation plans.
Yeah, I guess...
But I'll be busy during Christmas.
Huh?
Starting with this!
A going-away party?
Kirius and Array are going back to their home planet,
so we thought of doing a going-away/Christmas party for them.
I want to give them a big send-off.
What?
Isn't the Sweats Club always busy around Christmas with requests for help?
A going-away party on top of that?
Can you manage?
No problem!
This year, it's not just me!
We still haven't tracked down Moid.
We've made inquiries to Le Garite,
but they claim he hasn't been back.
What about Dizelmine?
Have you asked him directly?
Yes.
I asked him after explaining the situation,
but I received the same reply.
Moid is now a wanted man throughout the Polyhedron,
but we have no clues to his whereabouts after he left Pharos.
I see...
It's been 20,000 years...
Now, let's go.
Even after watching this so many times, it never ceases to amaze me.
How that stone tablet could become so small.
It's beyond current human logic.
That's technology from the age when the Vox were created.
Moid is able to use it
because he's a human from 20,000 years ago.
The giant green demon will rip the heavens...
The giant blue demon will devour the stars...
The giant orange demon will spew out darkness...
Through countless sacrifices, they will rule the land...
It's an old tale told in Le Garite.
As you all know, it tells of the tragedy brought on by the Vox.
Just for the record,
the person who piloted that Vox... was me.
What?!
My real name is Maycun.
I was the queen of a nation that existed here 20,000 years ago,
known as Le Garite.
Why have you kept this from us until now?
Because I thought you wouldn't believe me.
I thought perhaps I could do something
to prevent the same tragedy from happening again...
That is why I returned.
Moid, however, probably has other plans.
We need to find him as soon as possible.
You know, I wish you had told us sooner.
Huh?
You're the one who handpicked
each of us from around the globe, remember?
Everyone...
I have a ton of questions I want to ask you.
But first, people, contact Polyhedron again and find Moid!
Yes, sir!
Kirius, why didn't you put a cover on your Ovid?
Man, you can be so lazy!
And because of that,
we're ending up having to do more work. You-
I wasn't being lazy.
What was it, then?
It's unsightly.
It's bad enough that we have them parked on a harbor,
so just deal with it.
True.
Hey!
You guys hungry?
So you're going home, eh?
Yes.
Thank you for all your help.
What're you going to do when you go back?
I intend to take over as the head of my family.
Huh?
Kirius comes from a very proper noble family.
But it seems they're going through some difficult times right now.
Really?
So you're a rich kid.
How about you, Array?
I'm thinking of becoming an instructor at the Royal Academy.
A teacher, huh!
That might just suit you.
You're not the nitpicky sort.
I won't be dressed in these clothes, though.
Oh yeah, so I hear you're not going back?
Huh?
Uh...yeah...
I plan on training to become a cook.
I see... You're staying on Earth.
If I quit now, it'll feel like I gave up part way.
If I continue a bit longer, I think I'll find something.
Yeah.
You've got backbone, all right.
You can call me Old Man, if you'd like.
Why?
Okay!
Let's do this!
We have a winner!
Third prize is a Christmas cake.
Congratulations.
Who's next?
Oh, Ms. Machiko!
I hope you win the grand prize - the big-screen TV!
Kyono, aren't you forgetting something?
Huh?
Your post-graduation plans.
Oops! But I have a packed schedule today...
Bring it to me tomorrow!
Wow!
Ms. Machiko, you hit the jackpot!
The Kamogawa Prize!
A room for two and a lavish dinner!
Wow!
Congratulations!
Who will you be going with?
With Yoko! You got a problem with that?!
Why is she angry when she won?
Madoka...
Hi, kids!
Santa's here!
We brought presents for all the good boys and girls!
Yay!
Okay, one at a time!
Hurry up, hurry up!
Stop that!
All right, line up in a straight line!
Okay!
Perfect!
How fun!
Sorry we're late.
We've been waiting for you, Sweats Club!
Oh, three this year?
Yes! We have three times the youth!
That was so much fun!
What a wonderful Christmas!
Yeah!
We have Lan's brother and Big Brother Giuvi to thank
for being able to do all these Sweats Club activities.
If it weren't for them, the Polyhedron would still be fighting,
and we wouldn't be enjoying Christmas like this.
Everyone working together and being happy is the best!
Agreed.
Is this how you spend your Christmas every year, Madoka?
Yup!
Always. And next year...
Are you okay?
Snow!
No wonder it's so cold.
So pretty.
The colors of spring, summer, autumn and winter.
They're all so different.
It's fun to see them change.
It's just like Madoka.
Huh?
My vote goes to Izo for who cries first.
Then I vote for Kirius.
I'll go with Array.
But won't Izo be the one seeing them off?
Those three have been together all this time.
It will be hard on Izo to be separated from those two.
Array and Kirius will be separated too,
once they return to their home planet.
In that case,
I'll vote for all three crying at the same time.
The three of them found their paths in life.
Yeah...
Their path in life?
Oh...
Your post-graduation plans.
When I think about it,
I feel like steam's going to come out of my head.
My head's hot...
Huh?
Are you overheating?
She's right. It's hot!
I think you have a fever.
Something to eat might make it go away...
Madoka!
This is supposed to be good for you, so I made some.
Pickled plums?
Uh-huh.
I wonder what it tastes like...
You've never had pickled plums before?
Want to try?
Does it taste bad?
No, it's delicious.
Right?
You know...
Since coming here, I've been able to try lots of different foods.
On Le Garite, I was a very picky eater.
Kamogawa is a great place, isn't it?
Yes.
Muginami...
Lan, Muginami!
Over here...
It's becoming untied...
Lan, did you submit your post-graduation plan?
I see...
Did you, Muginami?
I want to do something to help my home planet U-Go.
That's why I'm planning to return to De Metrio.
Same here.
I want to help my brother.
How should we break the news to Madoka?
Don't know...
Madoka probably thinks we're going to stay here forever.
But it was Madoka who helped me make up my mind.
I know. Madoka helped me change, as well.
Thanks to her, I know I can help my brother now.
She'll understand, won't she?
She will.
After all...
We're one now.
How's the analysis of the stone tablet coming?
You're pushing yourself too hard.
Rest a bit.
Thank you.
But I can't take a break while making the crew work.
It's not your fault that you lost your memory.
It's time you let go of the past, that burden you've been carrying.
If you don't, you won't get any work done.
Everyone looked stunned...
Can you blame them?
Then, Ms. Chairman, how old does that really make you?
Let's just say 20,010 years old.
And so,
here's to the future of these three young men.
Cheers!
Cheers!
Array...
Kirikiri...
This song's for you!
This must be pretty serious to warrant a top-secret call.
Yes.
There's something we need to talk about.
Is this about Moid?
Who is he?
I rechecked his history in the Le Garite database,
but other than being a top Vox researcher,
there's nothing else there.
When did he become Dizelmine's aide?
He's been associated with the Le Garite royal family for quite some time now.
Have you met with Dizelmine lately?
Yes...
You haven't, have you?
He's using Moid and planning something.
Is that what you're thinking?
Exactly.
I don't know what Moid is up to,
but I can't believe Dizelmine has anything to do with it.
Besides, wasn't it Novumundus that assigned Moid to Pharos as a bridge person
between Polyhedron and Earth?
A bridge?
That's right! That has to be it!
What is it?
It's nothing...
Anyhow, let me know if you uncover anything.
Sure...
Bridge...
The Bridge Person of Neuenkirchen.
If I apply that algorithm...
With all due respect...
Why do you continue to cover for the king of Le Garite even in this situation?
I'm not covering for him.
Then why?
When we had our run-in the other day,
I remembered how we did the same thing in the past.
20,000 years ago, our ancestors found a new world
where they gave birth to the Polyhedron nation.
Dizelmine argued that in order to maintain this hard-earned peace,
the people must have a single, strong leader.
And then he exiled you, Lord Villagiulio,
to Planet U-Go for questioning his decision.
He used you as an example to the others.
That's not quite right.
At the time,
he thought I had betrayed him and allied with the opposition.
Betrayed him?
No one would follow Dizelmine's despotic way of thinking in the first place!
Forgive me.
More than anyone,
he wishes for peace within the Polyhedron.
It is also my wish as well.
And that is why you tried to make peace with him
at the Intergalactic Conference.
But look at the result.
This time, I want to believe him until the very end.
I want to believe in that strong passion of his.
Your Majesty, shall we call it a day?
If I may, sir...
Even though this is the only way to achieve
your greatest wish of protecting the peace of the Polyhedron.
I am still very honored that you have agreed to my suggestion.
Enough talk.
Continue.
As you wish.
You will...
never betray me...again...
Villagiulio!
Lan, you did your best, good job!
Now in closing,
let's have Array and Kirius say a few words!
Uh... Thank you for putting together
such a wonderful party for us today.
Almost makes me want to...
I really appreciate all of you.
We will never forget the days we spent here in Kamogawa.
I want to say thank you in so many ways,
but that would sound cliche, so...
Uh, I...
I will be remaining here for a while, but...
Now that these three will be setting out on their new journey,
it brought back memories of how we all first met.
The whole idea of letting aliens work for me part-time sounded crazy!
Or, so I thought.
But you turned out to be really awesome guys!
I'm gonna miss you!
Damn, I think I'm gonna cry!
Boss!
Uncle Hiroshi...
I didn't see that one coming.
Yeah, they're crying their eyes out.
Hey.
Oh, Big Sis.
You're late.
Sorry.
Looks like it was a nice going-away party.
Yeah.
Here.
When we told them you guys were leaving,
the people over at the shopping district gave us all these!
Look at all this!
Take care!
Per...fect!
It's...
a Memoria!
A planet that shines brighter than De Metrio...
This once-dead planet has become brilliant again, hasn't it?
Care to explain the meaning of this?
I'm sorry.
I haven't done it yet.
I understand it's hard to decide,
but in a few months, you'll be forced to face that reality.
Why can't you write something?
Uh...because I had no place to write what I want to do.
What?
Because neither of these...
What's going on? Was that an accident, or...?
War has started in space.
A war between Le Garite and De Metrio.
What?!
But I thought Lan's brother and Big Brother Giuvi made up?
So why is this happening?
I need to go and find out!
Depending on their answers,
they'll get more than just my Kamogawa Dynamite Bomber!
