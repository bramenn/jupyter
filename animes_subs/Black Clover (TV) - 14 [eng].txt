It appeared as though humanity would be destroyed by the demons.
But a single mage saved them all.
He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
In a certain world, where magic is everything...
Asta and Yuno were abandoned on the same day at
a church in the village of Hage, which lies in the boonies.
They both dreamed of becoming the Wizard King, the highest rank among mages,
and worked hard every day.
In the year they turned fifteen,
they both received grimoires, which enhance the owner's magical powers.
They then took the Magic Knights Entrance Exam to join
the Magic Knights, which are led by the Wizard King.
Let's see who can become the Wizard King!
As a result, because Yuno possesses immense magical powers,
out of the nine squads, he chose the elite Golden Dawn to join.
As for Asta, who had no magical powers,
he ended up joining the squad of rogues, the Black Bulls.
I'm still going to become the Wizard King someday!
Thus the two finally took the first step toward becoming the Wizard King.
Wh-What's going on?
Wh-What the heck is this?!
Sir, there's trouble. An anomaly
An anomaly has occurred, right?
Well... Let's have them work on this mission.
Them?
I would always close my eyes
And cower at reality
I can't stand the idea
Of just making excuses to give up
Stand right there
I don't want to be near you
Any minute now
Just wait right there
(The decisive battle is still a long way off)
Black and blue
I'll give up on giving up
And get the world on my side
I'm looking for the reason I'm alive
Every time somewhere under this sky
Break through the tearful nights
And head where the light shines
I want to keep my promise
I'll deliver it to you
shape of love
Dungeon
Black Bulls' Base
Hey, Magna. Let's fight. No holding back.
Nine hundred eighty-two...
Nine hundred eighty-three...
No way, you battle-obsessed freak.
Nine hundred eighty-four...
Oh, come on. Let's do it.
Nine hundred eighty-five...
I'm gonna eat your pudding.
Nine hundred eighty-six...
If you do that, I'll
Nine hundred eighty-seven...
Will you fight me?!
Will you?!
No.
Nine hundred eighty-eight...
Aw...
Nine hundred eighty-nine...
Silvantus Schnauzer.
Nine hundred ninety...
I think something else would be better.
Nine hundred ninety-one...
Let's see... Like Wine!
Nine hundred ninety-two...
Nine hundred ninety-three...
Wine?
Nine hundred ninety-four...
I will allow you to borrow a single letter
Nine hundred ninety-five...
from the name of my little sister, the goddess Marie.
Nine hundred ninety-six...
I will let you take the M. Be grateful.
Nine hundred ninety-seven...
Make it something cooler!
Nine hundred ninety-eight...
Like, let's see...
Nine hundred ninety-nine...
Magnam Fire!
One thousand...
Lame.
One thousand and one...
You have no taste, Lady Noe.
More like you don't.
One thousand and two...
Thinking of names looks like fun.
One thousand and three...
I thought of one, too. I wonder if they'll ask. I think it's a good name.
One thousand and four...
Munchy, munchy, munchy...
One thousand and five...
Can I fatten that bird up? He looks really yummy.
One thousand and six...
One thousand and seven...
Absolutely not!
One thousand and eight...
Does he lay eggs?
Huh?
Definitely Toritaro!
No, it's Silvantus Schnauzer.
Toritaro!
Silvantus Schnauzer!
Toritaro!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
The heck was that for, Toritaro?!
There, you see?
You prefer Silvantus Schnauzer, don't you?
Right? Right?
Magnam Fire!
M.
Wine!
Why not Nero?
What?!
Looks like he approves.
Nero means black.
Nero?
All right, listen up.
Mister Yami! Hello!
We're back, everyone.
What did they want at the castle?
If it's a mission, I want to go with everyone, too.
Mission? Is it a mission?
I have an announcement for you all.
A new dungeon has been discovered.
A dungeon?!
Are you serious, Mister Yami?!
What the heck is a dungeon?!
Huh?
Are you serious? You were surprised, and you didn't even know what it is?
I just went with the flow!
Talk about predictable!
Listen up. Dungeons are...
Kind of like ancient tombs that contain relics made by the people from back then.
Sometimes they have info about powerful ancient magic
or super rare magical items.
They're absolutely amazing!
But you know...
The people back then set insane magical traps in them
so that they wouldn't get misused by anyone.
They're super dangerous and really fun!
The Magic Knights always investigate them since they're so dangerous,
and to make sure none of the treasures get stolen.
Oh, okay!
I see.
Which means the Black Bulls are supposed to investigate this
newly discovered dungeon?
Yes.
Clover Kingdom
Particularly because this dungeon popped up near our enemy's border.
Dungeon
Enemy?
Diamond Kingdom
The Diamond Kingdom.
We need to take care of this mission fast so Diamond's people won't steal anything.
By the way, there have been instances in which someone found a magical item
that could change civilization itself in a dungeon,
and someone even learned how to use the ultimate magic there.
I might be able to use the ultimate magic, too!
You don't have any magic, so that's not happening.
You never know!
Actually, you can go, kid.
In fact, the Wizard King chose you himself.
Huh?
Huh?!
The Wizard King?! Why?!
That's awesome, Asta!
What the heck? Did you bump into the Wizard King somewhere?
No, never!
The Wizard King chose me!
I don't know why, but...
Great Wizard King!
Asta the Unworthy will give his all on this mission!
Noelle, you're also going with him.
Huh?
Everything counts as experience.
Oh, and Luck.
You're the leader.
I'm leaving those two to you.
Really?
Yup.
You'll lose your touch if you stay cooped up all the time.
Yay!
Listen up. Make sure you look after the newbies.
Leave it to me!
I want to go, too. I wish they'd take me with them.
Be careful.
Asta! Lady Noe! Give it your all!
Got it!
I guess I don't have a choice.
I think I'll go find some cute girls, then.
Huh?
May I go see my sister?
If you're prepared to die.
The sunset is beautiful from here.
I recommend this location for dates.
I'll have some nummies ready for you when you get back!
We're counting on you.
Got it.
Okay!
Let's see... It's this way.
They could've just dropped us off right in front of the dungeon.
Finral's only able to go to places he's been to before.
But thankfully, it was still near the dungeon.
Let's go!
Why the heck did you come?
I wonder how the Wizard King even knew about Asta.
That guy...
is able to see things we can't.
He's also a weirdo.
It's so dark.
Don't cling to me. It's hard to walk.
Wh-Who's clinging?
I can't see anything!
Ow...
Hey, could you not step on my foot?
I can't help it! It's pitch black in here!
Stop being so pissy.
It's all because you broke the lamp!
Honestly, you have some nerve.
It's your fault for tripping and running into me!
How dare you? I'm royalty!
So what?!
Insect.
Is this it?
W-Wow!
What the heck's going on with this place?
What is this?
Looks like the space is warped because of magic.
There's even stronger mana floating around here than outside.
Yes. I've never been anywhere this full of mana before.
Really?
Are you saying you can't feel all this mana?
Not at all.
Amazing. I guess people who don't have magic really are different.
Shut up!
I want to feel mana, too!
I want mana!
Must be nice being one of you royals!
You have a ridiculous amount of mana!
In my body, I don't have even an ounce
of the foundation of magic... Mana!
God damn!
Huh?
T-Trap magic?
That was dangerous. Be more careful.
My bad.
Here it is, Asta.
This.
Where?
Hup.
What was that for?!
That was amazing!
Listen, you!
Oh, there's another one.
Hup!
Whee!
And another one!
This is so much fun!
Isn't this exciting?
We're going to die if we stay with this guy.
I wonder if those kids are okay.
The more dangerous the mission, the more newbies will surpass their limits and grow.
I think.
You think?
Well, Luck's with them, so they should be fine.
His ability to detect mana is off the charts. It's even greater than a noble's.
If his personality wasn't so messed up, any other squad would've taken him.
I think it's that personality we're worried about.
Yeah.
Man... Your anti-magic weapon is amazing.
I wonder if that's why the Wizard King chose you.
I'd love to fight you for real in about two to three years!
If you're prepared to keep swinging your sword around like that,
this dungeon won't be any problem.
Got it!
Now, then...
I think I'm about to reach my limit.
I knew it.
There are others here.
The strongest looking one is...
Holy Lightning Boots.
Something important just came up.
So I'm leaving the dungeon exploration to you guys!
Hey, where are you
Wh-What in the world is he thinking?!
S-So cool!
This is insane!
Left turn next...
I can't wait to see how strong this person is!
Honestly... He's unbelievable.
Captain Yami clearly told him to keep an eye on us, and he just left!
Don't worry.
No matter what kind of traps might spring up, I'll slice through them with my sword.
Must be nice being as carefree as you.
This dungeon ain't nothin'!
I'm going to become the Wizard King, after all.
Again with that?
I'm gonna become the Wizard King before Yuno.
Yuno?
Yeah. I haven't told you about him before?
He's a childhood friend I grew up with in Hage Village.
We took the Magic Knights Entrance Exam together,
and he got into the Golden Dawn.
That's amazing, isn't it?
He got into the Golden Dawn without being a noble.
Yeah! He's amazing!
But I'm not gonna lose to him!
I guess even he has his own goal.
Come on. Let's go.
Looks like we can cross over there.
Let's hurry!
We're alone right now.
Silvantus... I mean, Nero's with us, but...
Something wrong?
It's nothing! Nothing at all!
Let's hurry.
A trap! Oh, no!
Noelle!
S-Such powerful magic...
Run!
Asta!
Oh, no!
Crap!
What the heck?
Such precise and powerful magic...
Who could it be?
Oh, come to think of it...
Apparently, a few from the Golden Dawn have also been assigned to that dungeon.
Huh? The Golden Dawn?!
I wonder if they'll be able to get along.
Now...
I've repaid my debt,
Asta.
Yuno...
My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
And push me forward
(I can't find a place to go)
Even the faintest light can still break through the darkness
And change the flow of time
(I will keep believing in you)
In this ever-vivid place
(Break free yourself)
In order to grasp my endless dream
If there is a path that I should choose
(Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)
Wherever it may lead us
Until my life comes to an end
I will accept any pain that comes my way
(We can try again, we can try again)
Even if we can't see tomorrow
Holding onto feelings too intense to voice
I'll keep screaming them in my heart
Petit Clover!
What's Mana?
What's Mana?
Asta, do you know what mana is?
Yup!
Mana
It's written like this!
Mana
It's written with the same character for magic!
Serious
These both mean serious!
Yes. Mana is a powerful energy that exists in this world.
Yup! And everyone has it...
Except me!
Mages use up their mana to use magic.
That's why if they run out of it,
they might not be able to use magic again until they recover.
Do you understand?
Yes!
What a lovely flower!
Perfect for giving to a girl.
Finral!
Wow, you're so aggressive!
I've never met a flower like you!
You've got really powerful magic, mister.
Let's fight with everything we have, to the death.

Not giving up is my magic.
