I finally made it to the magic academy, Luna Nova!
You only told us about a hundred times last night.
I have no idea why it was in that forest,
but I'll keep it safe until I can give it back to Chariot one day.
Animate, Alcor!
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move!
Right, you came to Luna Nova for your deadly poison collection.
Figured I could stay a bit longer.
How's this? Or this?!
Make my cheeks tear!
We wear that for school functions and practical lessons. This is for regular classes.
That one's for school functions and practical lessons. This is for regular classes.
After that is foundational magic pharmaceutics and magic numerology.
Today I take my first step as a witch!
Today we commence lessons for Luna Nova's one thousand five hundred ninety-eighth term.
Please rectify yourself, Professor Ursula.
How are you to guide the students as you are?
I simply want to tutor her about fundamental magic during my spare time,
and make sure she feels comfortable here.
All the while, it is your lack of dignity as a teacher that makes me feel lost about how to handle you.
And yet it is your lack of dignity as a teacher that makes me feel lost about how to handle you.
It is a form of phonemic orthography.
You are the first person able to read this that I have witnessed as a teacher.
Now please turn to line 102 on page 923 of your textbooks.
You won't be able to find anyone who respects Shiny Chariot's magic.
Jush khul mih Akcho.
Everyone says she's the greatest witch to ever grace Luna Nova since its founding!
As you wish, I do not mind referring to you as Akko.
However, you will not find anyone in the magic world who holds Chariot's magic in high regard.
However, you will not anyone in the magic world who holds Chariot's magic in high regard.
However, those gaudy but insubstantial spectacles of hers had no lasting power.
But as it were, her all style and no substance performance magic had no lasting power.
Nobody even cares enough to attempt to find out where she is now.
Make a miracle like you did yesterday!
Animate, o statue!
Magic is developed through the accumulation of lasting traditions and assiduous research.
It is not something that those who would be swayed by temporary diversions can learn.
Diana is a daughter of the 1500-years-old Cavendish family.
Diana is a daughter of the fifteen hundred year old Cavendish family.
She's on a completely different level than that showy Chariot witch!
She's on a completely different level than that show witch Chariot!
A believing heart is your magic.
Yeah. I remember everyone was big on collecting her cards during the Chariot fad when I was a kid.
Though I'm having trouble with the spell pronunciations.
The only parts I'm not sure about are the spell pronunciations.
I know this one. It's the magic butterfly.
They emerge only once every hundred-twenty years, and legend says they bring hope to the hearts of all who behold them.
They emerge only once every hundred-twenty years, and legend says they bring hope to the hearts of all who see them.
They emerge only once every hundred-twenty years,
and legend says they bring hope to the hearts of all who see them.
Professor Ursula. Has your research revealed anything about the cause?
Once that which caused it leaves...
Once the origin of it has left...
That which caused it? Have you unearthed some information?
The origin? Have you unearthed some information?
The Jennifer Memorial Tree has deteriorated so such a state...
It is so, Diana. This Memorial Tree is already rather aged.
Perhaps it is now finally reaching the end of its lifespan.
Perhaps it is finally reaching the limits of its lifespan.
Large plants should revitalize provided strong enough nourishment.
Ropelial Ral!
Nourishment should now be circulating throughout it.
There were parasites in the roots.
I must eliminate them.
Magic butterflies that bring hope to the hearts of all who see them!
Papilliodya that travels the five continents.
Papilliodya spend 120 years as a larva in the dark underground before becoming butterflies.
The delight of their first flight brings hope to the hearts of those who see.
Goodness, the memorial Tree!
Diana is the pride of Luna Nova.
If I reach out, it's sure to begin!
My very own story!
Noctu... Orfei!
Aude Fraetor!
Shiny Arc!
Oh, that's right!
The Shiny Rod!
It wasn't just a dream!
I finally made it to the witch academy, Luna Nova!
Oh yeah!
Yay!
Morning, Lotte!
Check it out!
The Shiny Rod, right?
You got it!
You only told us about it a hundred times last night.
It's Shiny Chariot's magic staff!
I have no idea why it was in that forest, but I'll keep it safe until the day I can give it back to Chariot.
As long as I've got this staff, I bet I can cast any magic I want.
O bed, take flight!
Move, Alcor!
Move, move!
I said move! Start moving!
Why you... move, move!
What are you doing, Sucy?
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move!
I'm extracting the petrification poison from this cockatrice feather.
Right, you came to Luna Nova for your collection of deadly poisons.
Why won't it move?
I originally planned to go back after getting myself a cockatrice feather...
Okay... I can do this. I know I can do it!
But then I heard there might be samples of an extinct poisonous mushroom here.
You can do it. You can do it, Akko!
There! Take that!
So I figured I might as well stay a bit longer.
How's that? Or this?!
Here! Once more!
Blow, o wind!
Tear my cheeks up!
That's strange...
It was definitely working yesterday.
Put that down and get ready. We can't be late for class.
Class?!
Yay! Transformation complete!
Let's move out!
We wear that one for school functions and practical lessons. This is for regular classes.
Aw, really?
First period is magic linguistics.
Then, fundamentals of magic pharmaceutics followed by magic numerology.
Today is the day I take my first step as a witch!
Akko, hurry up!
I'm coming!

Today, we commence lessons for Luna Nova's one thousand five hundred ninety-eighth term.
Let us honor the great Nine Olde Witches as we
Professor Ursula...
M-My apologies.
Please straighten yourself out, Professor Ursula.
How are you to guide your students with a demeanor such as yours?
R-Right.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Now then, please explain yourself, Professor Ursula.
What compelled you to mentor that new student, Atsuko Kagari?
I simply want to tutor her about fundamental magic during my spare time
and help her make herself at home here.
She must feel quite lost as a Japanese student coming from a non-magic lineage.
And yet it is your lack of dignity as a teacher that makes me feel lost about how to handle you.
Oh, look!
It's Kagari.
Professor Finneran, excuse me to go say hello
Oh my!
Oh, oh, oh!
This is kinda lame.
Well, whatever.
I can't wait to see what magic lessons are like!
It's so thrilling and exciting!
In summary, the luna alphabet is a traditional writing system that was used by ancient witches.
It constitutes a form of phonemic orthography.
Is anybody able to read what I have written on the board?
Miss Cavendish.
Fortune to she who lets the stone rest.
A curse upon she who does not.
That was splendid, Diana Cavendish.
For as long as I have been a teacher here, you are the first person able to read this.
I knew Diana could do it.
The more you stir, the further the color changes.
Then add a lively frog into the cauldron.
The frog must be taken straight from water to avoid its secretions.
Entrail of newt, crushed bat nails.
Carefully, carefully add them to the pot...
How's that? Doesn't it have a wondrous odor?
A-As I have explained, it is believed that Pythagoras laid the foundations of sorcery and divination.
Now, please turn to line 102 on page 923 of your textbooks.
From a numerology perspective, the numbers one through five can be used to represent the universe
Professor Badcock.
I believe it reads one through four, not one through five.
What?
Wh-What a blunder. You are absolutely correct.
Talk about losing face.
What's going on here?!
How are lessons about magic this boring?!
Isn't magic supposed to be flashy and all about dreams and miracles?
Lotte, could you pass that?
S-Sure.
This is nothing like I imagined.
I can hardly believe this is the same school Shiny Chariot learned magic at.
You'd be hard pressed to find anyone who respects Shiny Chariot's magic.
Certainly not at this academy.
Your name is Kagari, correct?
You are the new student.
Chusht khul mih Akcho.
Just call me Akko. Uh, you were the one standing out...
Diana Cavendish.
You don't know who Diana is?
She's like a celebrity in the magic world.
Everyone says she's the greatest witch to ever grace Luna Nova since its founding!
I do not mind referring to you as Akko, as you suggested.
In any case, you will not find anyone in the magic world who holds Chariot's magic in high regard.
It's in your best interest to remember that.
That can't be true!
Chariot's magic show was world-renowned and beloved by all!
I must admit...
She did enjoy a period of popularity in the past.
However, those gaudy yet insubstantial spectacles of hers had no lasting power.
Almost ten years have passed since Chariot left the stage and disappeared.
There is nobody who cares enough to even attempt to find out where she is now.
Chariot is...
She gave me a dream!
That much is true.
I even found her Shiny Rod.
Shiny Rod?
This must be a common replica.
It is not!
Are you truly proud of that toy?
It's perfect for a commoner.
I'll show you one of Chariot's miracles!
Peel your eyes!
Don't do it, Akko.
I know I'll succeed if I believe!
Please, Shiny Rod.
Show me another miracle, like you did yesterday!
Move, o statue!
S-Statue, move! Move for me!
Come on, start moving! Please!
I said to move!
Akko...
Why? It worked yesterday...
Ansolew Airo!
Wow...
That's incredible.
High class magic to breathe life into a statue!
You're the miracle witch, Diana!
Akko, are you all right?
Magic is cultivated through the accumulation of lasting traditions and assiduous research.
It is not something that those prone to temporary diversions can learn.
Diana is a daughter of the 1500-year-old Cavendish family.
She's on a completely different level than that performance witch Chariot!
Wait up!
Diana!
Professor Ursula.
Y-Yes?!
Have you looked into the matter I requested of you?
I-I was about to!
Little Witch Academia

A believing heart is your magic.
Ten years since she disappeared...
I wonder what Chariot is doing now...
Nobody anywhere has any idea.
Hey, it must've been pretty hard to collect all these.
Yeah. I remember everyone was big on collecting her cards during the Chariot craze when I was a kid.

There was just one premium card I was never able to get.
I wanted it so badly, too.
The mushroom of recalling lost love.
It's a unicorn.
The immortal holy beast that protects maidens' happiness.
You have it memorized?
Of course, I remember all of them.
Though I always had trouble with the spell pronunciations.
Oh, I know this one. It's the magic butterfly.
Papilliodya.

They emerge only once every hundred-twenty years,
and legend says they bring hope to the hearts of all who behold them.
It's quite weakened.
Professor Ursula. Has your research revealed anything about the origin of its affliction?
Y-Yes, I believe that its current state of weakness is only temporary.
Once the cause of it leaves...
The cause of it? Have you unearthed some information?
I would like to dig a bit deeper first...
Please determine the full truth.
Headmistress.
The Jennifer Memorial Tree has been reduced to such a sorry state...
It is so, Diana. This Memorial Tree is already rather advanced in years.
Perhaps it is finally reaching the end of its lifespan.
The Jennifer Memorial Tree...
Luna Nova's tree of life left behind to inherit the will of the great witch Jennifer.
I've finished this side.
I'll attempt to use revitalization magic on the magic tree.
Provided strong enough nourishment, large plants can be brought to life again.
This is a secret art passed down through generations of the Cavendish family.
Louperial Ral!
The flow of nutrients should now be restored.
You've done it, Diana!
Let's go inform the teachers!
I knew it!
My hunch was correct.
How could I not have realized?
Then this means...
A miracle is approaching.
Four damage to Sucy's life.
That means I win!
Yay, nine straight wins!
Why can you use effects that aren't even written on the card? I don't get it.
One more round.
What is this thing?!
Over there, Akko!
What is the meaning of this?
Stand back!
Diana?
What's going on here?
Look!
What are these things?
Looks like chrysalises to me.
Chrysalises?!
And not normal ones at that.
The roots had parasites.
They must be the cause of the Tree's decline.
My magic must have passed through the Tree and nourished the pests!
I have to eliminate them.
Murowa!
Murowa!
Murowa!
Aren't these...
Murowa
Hold on, Diana!
These might not be pests after all!
You're interfering. Get out of the way!
I won't!
Murowa!
Akko!
Hang in there!
What has she done?
She's churning with magic.
This might be bad.
Papilliodya...
They're papilliodya chrysalises...
From this?
I'm sure of it.
Papilliodya that only emerge once every hundred-twenty years!
Magic butterflies that bring hope to the hearts of all who behold them!
Wait, Akko! Try casting this spell.
The papilliodya spell.
Um, Papillio Fillia...
Papillio Fillio Nymphodya.
Is that the proper pronunciation?
Thanks!
Papilliodya that travel the five continents.
Take flight, magic butterflies, towards hope!
Papillio Fillio Nymphodya!
Papilliodya spend 120 years as larvae in the dark underground before becoming butterflies.
As butterflies, the delight of their first flight
Hey, look outside!
The delight of their first flight brings hope to the hearts of those who behold them.
Goodness, the Memorial Tree!
How splendid!
It's all thanks to Diana's magic!
Thank you, Diana.
P-Please wait! This was not my doing...
Who else besides you could have done it?
Please excuse me.
Diana truly is the pride of Luna Nova.
