You're restless, Kanaloa...
Do you also feel a stirring in your heart?
Yes. This is a holy war.
And I shall give no quarter to any who would oppose me.
Who are you?!
What...?!
You're Coco...?!
What are you doing in this world?!
Um... Coco, you're that girl from Edolas, right?
I see! You must have come to Earthland while we were gone!
Considering all that, you look pretty young...
What the hell is going on here, Coco?!
Please don't talk so familiarly to me.
This is my first time meeting you people.
What?!
How could you forget us?!
That's not what's going on! I think...
Huh?
I'm starvin'!
I wonder where Gajeel-san went off to...
A Man doesn't flee from his enemy!
Who are they?
Clients?
Huh?
Natsu-san, this person...
Queen Shagotte...?
Not her...
Coco?!
Long time no see! I mean, how did you get to Earthland?!
It seems like they're totally mistaking us for other people!
Not important, Mary Hughes.
Let's hurry up and get to work, Sugar Boy-san.
Hughes?
Sugar Boy?!
The guys we fought at that royal amusement park!
Now that you mention it, the face is similar...
And you were a man!
What are you dressed like a woman for?!
I hate this guy already...
By the way, um...
What have you come here for?
This is our guild!
The rumors were right. You are a pitiful bunch of wizards.
What?!
We've got just one demand.
Hand over Lucy Heartfilia!
Hand her over...?!
This is my first time seeing a marriage proposal...
That's not what this is!
Targeted Lucy!
There's no point in hiding her.
We know Lucy Heartfilia belongs to this guild.
Maybe we'd better introduce ourselves, baby!
What is this about?
Why are they after you, Nee-san?
Don't ask me!
You suddenly show up out of nowhere and make this ridiculous demand?!
I'm the Master here.
You tell me to give you one of my people without so much as a reason,
you can't seriously expect me to say, Oh, of course.
I don't know who you people are, but get the hell outta here now!
Oh my goodness, how scary...
Recently, several churches have been attacked.
Are you the ones...?
I see...
Even without positive proof, the timing is too convenient.
Spicy!
I mean, that's a spicy accusation...
That's outrageous...
We're not obliged to stand here and listen to your drivel.
Just give us Lucy Heartfilia immediately!
But if you refuse to cooperate...
Come on, my hound dogs!
Yes, the springtime of our lives!
What's this?
Is this a song?
Puppy dogs!
Please take care of these two-bit wizards!
That's just gross, in more ways than one!
It looks tasty...
How so?!
What the hell is this?!
Is it phlegm?!
Man!
What the hell?! I don't know what to grab on to!
Elfman!
Elf-niichan!
No! Stay back! This stuff is gonna do something!
Yummy!
The taste of wizards is spicy!
I can't move...
This brings back memories... A long time ago, the three of us
used to sleep in the same bed together like this...
This is no time for nostalgia!
What is that stuff?!
That mucus stuff has a will of its own?!
Like this...
Nobody touch it!
You said you were the guild's master, right?
Give her to us before people start getting hurt!
I have no interest in hitting kids!
I'm an adult!
Don't be naive, Macao!
They're the enemy!
I told you to call me Master!
No way an attack like that is gonna hit me!
What the hell is she?!
Pain in the ass...
You wench!
Huh?!
Cut it out!
The building's fallin' apart as it is!
Master! Everyone!
Crap! It's all we can do just to hold it off!
What is this?! It keeps getting bigger and bigger!
Natsu! Do something!
Um... You're totally white!
Natsu-san!
Don't tell me the damage from his duel with Laxus finally kicked in?!
That took a long time...
These guys are frickin' hilarious!
What spicy screams!
I guess it just goes to show that guild wizards are no big deal.
Coco...
No, it's not her... Nothing saddened Coco more than hurting people.
She hated violence...
This girl is...
Come back to me, Howls!
That's all, folks! You give up already?
Dammit...
My magic's exhausted...
What's going on here?!
They're not the people we know from Edolas!
Then they're the Coco, Hughes, and Sugar Boy who were already in Earthland!
I see...
Just like there were doubles of us in Edolas...
Lucy Heartfilia...
If you don't hurry up and identify yourself,
we're gonna put more of the hurt on your friends!
Unless you want us to keep going on a rampage...?
Don't do it, Lu-chan!
You've got to hold back...
They don't know who Lucy is yet...
You three get outta here and look for Gramps.
I'll manage here somehow...
But...
You can barely stand up, Natsu!
You three! You're totally suspicious!
Natsu-nii... Take this!
Thank you, Romeo...
That reeks!
Sorry! Gave you the wrong one...
Thanks for the meal, anyway...
Run, Lucy!
Hot!
Fire Magic?
That ain't nothin!
Command Magic!
Huh?
We're fighting each other?!
Why?!
I'm guessing that's...
Take that!
Here.
Crap!
That's what you get, wizards! Now dance some more for our amusement!
It seems that girl isn't a wizard...
A rock... She hit me with a rock...
I've totally got murder on my mind...
Enough!
Stay out of it, cat!
Wing Slash of the Sky Dragon!
Dummy!
Huh?!
It's because of that stick!
She can control the magic... I mean, the people?!
Ow...
Since it's come to this, I have no choice
but to call on my Celestial Spirits and fight...
Wish I could use Fleuve d'etoiles that I got from Virgo,
but it won't work for some reason...
You've got motion sickness?
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Why do I feel so exhausted...?
Elf-niichan... you're heavy...
Maybe it's because of that mucus stuff from before...
Crap! I can't move...
I've got no physical strength or magic power...
That stuff sapped it out of us...?
What do you want with Lucy?!
We don't have to answer you!
We'll give you five more seconds.
Alright! But stop attacking!
I'm...
I'm Lucy Heartfilia.
So you're the one...?
Walk over here quietly.
Wait a second...
I'm the one you're looking for.
What is it that you want with me?
I see. Despite being a guild wizard, she's definitely the daughter
of the former owner of the Heartfilia Konzern.
She sure has class!
I figured she'd be rougher around the edges...
What's going on here?!
Lucy Heartfilia...
The daughter of the former owner of the Heartfilia Konzern
and Fairy Tail's resident Celestial Spirit wizard...
If I'm not mistaken?
No mistake. That is me.
She's...
Now that they mention it, she sure looks like she fits the bill...
Hold on there! I'm Lucy!
Michelle-san...
I'm touched that you're trying to protect me.
But I don't think your lie would work anyway!
What are you saying?!
And even if they did believe it, they'd see through your guise soon enough!
I can't cause anyone more trouble than I already have!
Let's tell them the truth!
So that girl is trying to protect Lucy, huh?
W-What an impassioned performance!
It's beautiful! Man!
I'm Lucy!
I'm Lucy!
W-What should we do?
Well, we know the real thing is over 20 years old,
so the girl with the pigtails is too young to be her, right?
That's because we were on Tenroujima for seven years...
Lucy!
Back off! I won't let'em lay one finger on you!
R-Right! Understood!
This one's Lucy, too?!
You still have some fight in you, don't you, Lucy?
Yeah! Leave it to me!
Over there, too?!
Are you okay, Lucy?!
I'll pull through...
Are you hurt, Lucy?!
There's another one!
E-Everyone...
Nee-san...
I don't know which is the real one!
Damn them...
Are you healed up, Lucy?
I'm fine now, Lucy.
Spicy!
I'm Lucy, too!
Stop it!
This is totally ridiculous.
So we should just round'em all up?
Well...
Come on, my hound dogs!
Not this time!
Dazzling Blaze of the Fire Dragon!
Lucy! Now!
Natsu!
Nee-san!
Let's hurry, while those three are distracted!
Everyone...
I'm sorry...
Thank you!
Two got away!
When?!
After them, Coco!
Right!
Not if we have anything to say about it!
Free Run Unlock!
She jumped!
Scores: 8, 9, 9, and 10!
What the hell is that?!
Free Run, that's...
Athletic Magic...
It was banned after so many people got injured from it.
I'll stop her! Solid Script...
Iron!
There.
Sand Slash!
Wood Make! Violent Approach!
Sand and wood...
Not one of my hound dogs' favorites...
Again?!
They're being absorbed!
But they've got good chemistry with you.
In what month where you born? What's your blood type?
For now, let's look for the Master around here...
G-Good idea...
But why'd you say you were Lucy?!
W-Well, I thought you were in danger, so on impulse, I...
I'm a Celestial Spirit wizard, so even if they had captured me,
I would've been able to escape one way or another.
But if they'd gotten their hands on you, who can't use any magic...
I-I...
I'm sorry... I hadn't thought about what would happen after...
I can't use magic, so I thought I could at least help that way...
Look, I'm not mad... Uh, need a tissue?
You know, you really have a risky side...
But I'm touched. Thank you.
Nee-san...
Risky, huh?
Come to think of it, I may have been the same way
when I first joined the guild...
I'd act rashly again and again...
From now on, though, I've really got to keep it together.
By the way, I wonder why those guys are after me...
Kinana-san thought they might be the criminals who raided those churches...
But I don't have anything to do with any church...
Found you!
And I'm not letting you get away again!
You're scary in a plain way!
Follow my lead!
Sorry, sorry, I was lying before.
Actually, this girl is the real Lucy-chan!
Excuse me?!
Wrong! This one is the real deal!
This is the one and only Lucy-san!
Real Lucy-chan, lying to save your bacon from getting caught isn't right!
You know you're the genuine article!
In fact, the truth is that I was just lying now too,
so I actually am the real, true blue you-know-who!
But really, the real, true, actual, factual person
you're after is me after all!
Um... Uh...
I know this is sudden, but I am the genuine princess.
Huh?!
What did you suddenly come out for?!
I thought I would give you a hand, Princess.
Princess... You mean Lucy Heartfilia?
You are correct, but I am the true princess.
But you know, I may be Lucy after all...
I may be the real Lucy...
Actually, you're Lucy!
That went well, didn't it, Princess?
That girl's so innocent...
I feel really guilty about doing that to her...
It seems one of the two that Coco chased after is the real Lucy Heartfilia.
I see you can change your mode too, kitty-cat.
What?
That wasn't me!
Beast Arm...
Iron Bull!
This ticks me off! It's totally hard to fight like this!
Totally is what I say!
Don't copy me!
Jeez, you're so annoying! All of you, just fight for cryin' out loud!
Mary Hughes, our time here is limited.
I know that! I say we go after Lucy, too!
Over my dead body!
I can tame several people at once with my Command Magic!
Dammit! Nobody's gonna control me!
Natsu-san is...
These creeps are tough customers, huh?
Alright, big bang boom!
Yeesh. Where the hell did Gajeel go?
Everyone's probably back at the guild by now.
I wanted us to find him, for Levy's sake, too...
I guess we can go out looking again tomorrow...
What the heck is that?!
Hey, that's...
Wha...?!
What's going on here?!
What happened?!
Lucy-san! Michelle-san!
I know they're out looking for the Master,
but I don't know where they're looking!
Wendy, you have no idea?
Hmm... For some reason, I can't detect any trace of Lucy-san...
Bastards... Treatin' me like a smoke bomb...
They'll pay for this!
Calm down, Natsu!
So Natsu and the others went in search of Lu-chan.
Sorry. I got caught up in the fight...
Just the three of them made all of us look like fools.
Who could they be?
Halt!
Coco?!
Wendy!
Score: 9, 8, 10!
This is no time to give out scores!
It's dangerous here!
I lost sight of Lucy Heartfilia.
Tell me where she is.
Other than that...
Hey, Natsu, don't you know Lucy's scent?
Strange. It's like getting mixed up with another scent...
Maybe it's that thing's fault...?
Natsu, from below!
That guy again!
My hound dogs said they wanna play with you some more!
Sounds like fun!
I'll make'em look like a puddle of snail slime
and pay'em back 100 times over!
Oh, that's sweet! Too sweet, hot boy!
Whether it's food or people, I hate things that are sweet!
Even though your name is Sugar Boy?!
Sugar Boy-kun... It's no good if you see what's right in front of you,
but lose sight of the main subject.
What the hell is that?!
An octopus?
I'm sorry, Virgo. You were so kind to give it to me, but...
Not at all. I suspect the cause is being in suspended animation
for seven years, but I'll take it back
to the Celestial Spirit World and try repairing it.
Farewell, Princess.
Thank you!
So this is Celestial Spirit Magic...
Uh-huh, and there are a lot more than just Plue and Virgo!
Like the goat, Aquarius, and the crab?
How do you know?
You told me yourself!
Did I?
Awesome...
The exact route that Samuel figured you'd take beforehand...
Bingo!
Hughes!
Look... over there!
Where are you going?
M-My legs... My feet are moving by themselves...
Stop! You'll fall off the cliff!
I can't help it!
My legs aren't listening to me!
Hey, Hughes! I thought you were gonna take the both of us!
If you suffer a serious injury, there's no chance you'll escape again!
Wha...?!
Let go of me!
At this rate, you'll fall with me, Nee-san!
Have you found Lucy Heartfilia?
I believe we'll have her very soon, Byro-sama.
Byro?!
That bastard who sucked the magic power out of me and Wendy?!
That octopus?!
He's totally different from the Edolas Byro!
Don't be disrespectful! Byro-sama is standing on top of the octopus!
On top of the octopus?
He really is totally different!
We've come to capture the Heartfilia girl.
Swiftly dispose of those who stand in our way and return to the main mission.
Yes, sir!
Don't, Nee-san!
Let go of me!
I absolutely will not...
That's totally beautiful friendship!
That saves me the trouble of having to control both of you!
These guys are unexpectedly strong!
Yeah, well, if I get serious, they'll be a walk in the park!
Then why haven't you gotten serious?
It's cooler if I wait'til everyone is in a pinch,
then I swoop in and kick the bad guys' asses!
That's what you say, but I bet you're already fighting seriously
and still having a hard time!
N-Not even close!
Natsu, you're sweating.
Next time: The Fury of Legion!
S-Seriously, it'll be an easy win!
I think it'll be easier on you if you're honest...
Don't you look at me with sympathetic eyes!
