The Kingdom of Fiore...
A neutral country of 17 million people.
It is a world of magic.
Magic is bought and sold there every day.
It is an integral part of people's lives.
And there are those who use magic as their occupation.
Those people are referred to as wizards.
The wizards belong to various guilds and perform jobs on commission.
There are a large number of guilds within the country.
And in a certain city there lies a certain guild.
A guild from which various legends were once born... Or rather, will continue to be born long into the future...
Fairy Tail!
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Oh, yeah! Can you hear this voice?
Oh, yeah! It's hoarse from yelling.
Oh, yeah! Until your heart can hear it...
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
The moon and sun high-five.
Are you sure you're not forgetting something?
When you're not here to make me laugh,
even what I'm looking for can't be found.
Snowing, be honest with yourself and smile,
because when two people lay close, time overlaps.
Fairy, where are you going?
I'll gather all the light, and shine down on your tomorrow!
Don't say goodbye!
Last time on Fairy Tail!
Why the heck do I have to go with you?
Then don't come!
I want you two to lend me your strength.
Eisenwald?
We're going to stop their evil plan!
Natsu!
The flute of curse, Lullaby!
Master is in trouble!
So this is the true form of Lullaby?
You went overboard!
This footprint... Yes, there's no mistake.
It's already been two days since they passed by here.
That's plenty of time to reach Magnolia from here.
I wonder if something happened to them?
Anyway, let's go back and give our report.
We're not going after them?
This woman is Bisca Moulin.
This man is Alzack Connel.
Both of them are Fairy Tail wizards.
I see. This is a problem.
And we've received a notice from the Council, too...
Well, I was planning on going after them, but...
No, we couldn't.
That path went deep into Clover Canyon.
Even experienced hunters from Hunter Guilds can't get out once they loose their bearings.
A great natural labyrinth, huh?
Why would they head there?
They must have some reason.
Well, Master is with them, so it shouldn't be a problem, but...
Natsu Eats a Village!
Come on, Happy! You're lost again, aren't you?
We've been walking and walking, but we haven't gotten to Magnolia yet!
You sense-of-direction-less cat!
This place is known as Web Valley, as it is filled with innumerable fissures from an ancient earthquake.
As was mentioned before, it is said a great number of souls have gotten lost here, never to return.
How rude! I wasn't lost before. This is the first time.
I don't care if it's your first time or your last; the fact is, we're lost!
I'm starving...
Stop reminding me! It's only making me hungrier!
Well I'm hungry and that's that!
Then stop going on about it already!
Indeed...
I'm hungry!
Not you, too!
Enough.
It sounds like your stomach just went gu...
It said gu...
It did not. You're hearing things.
Nice cover-up there.
What's so exciting?
Natsu, look at that!
I can fly!
You can fly!
Can you fly?
It's the legendary delicacy, the winged fish!
They're super tasty!
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!
Legendary delicacy?
Winged fish...
Looks good to me!
Good going, Happy! Well done!
You are all way too hungry.
Your stomach agrees with us.
Yeah...
Okay, we're fishing!
Damn... Just when you think you've hooked one, it's gone.
I'm gonna do my best!
They don't really look all that tasty to me, however...
Shut up and fish.
At this rate, it doesn't matter as long as they're edible.
You're that hungry?
I want to eat a winged fish! They look delicious!
They're a legendary delicacy!
I gave up.
So much for willpower!
But I couldn't catch even one...
You're hungry, right? Then keep trying.
Don't give up,'kay?
Lucy, you meanie!
But I was encouraging you!
That was pretty tough.
In the end we only got one...
Happy, eat it.
I can't just eat it by myself...
If we split it up, it'll only make us hungrier!
Don't hold back! Eat, eat!
Right then! Thanks!
Sure seems like he's enjoying that fish there... Lucky him...
Gross!
It's gross?!
Anyway...
A village!
Houses!
And so, there's probably...
Food!
There's no one here.
It does seem really quiet for a village.
Maybe they're taking an afternoon nap.
Hey! Anybody here?
We're so hungry, we're about to faint!
Somebody give us food!
That's a little blunt, you famished cat.
Are they really all taking a nap?
Or maybe the whole village got drunk, and they're all passed out?
I think you're talking about Fairy Tail...
There, too!
Argh, this is annoying!
As long as I can get my strength back, I'll eat anything!
Hey, you aren't considering robbing the place, are you?
You had the same idea, didn't you?
Hey, anyone home?
Give us something to eat, please!
Yup, there's no one here.
Anyway, let's eat!
Okay! It's still good!
Let's eat!
Wait.
Why?!
This is suspicious.
Yeah. It looks like they were just eating.
Where did the people in this house disappear to?
How should I know? Anyway, let's eat, Happy.
Aye!
I said wait!
Right!
We must investigate this village first.
You must hold out until then. Hold out a little while-
Erza, your stomach is overruling you.
Not convincing at all, I see.
Natsu and Gray, go search for mushrooms or something!
Do not touch the food in the village!
Master and I will investigate what's going on in the village!
Fine, I got it.
Off we go, Happy.
Aye!
Why mushrooms?
And we finally found some good looking food...
I ain't gonna be satisfied with mushrooms!
Look, mushrooms!
Whoa, they look awesome!
Why mushrooms?
You know what?
What?
Natsu's going to eat a poisonous one like those laughing shrooms.
It's one of his signature gags!
What are you talking about, Happy?
I ain't gonna do a dumb joke like that...
Master...
I was just i-investigating!
I think I can fill up just on mushrooms, as long as I eat enough of them.
Setup complete! Now wait for it...
Fine, then hurry and pick them.
Natsu, are you okay?
See, here it comes!
What a shock!
I'm just as surprised myself!
I guess they weren't laughing shrooms...
You're disappointed?
What's all the fuss about?
Your heads. Look at your heads.
Huh?
What the heck is with that mushroom?
You should talk with a giant friggin' mushroom growin' out of your head!
Trying to spruce up your image?
Why aren't they worried about themselves?
Looks good on you! Too good!
Hey, droopyeyes... Did you just laugh at me?
And you're snickering like a damn fool!
Don't fight with mushrooms growing out of your heads!
So?
There is no one here, as we thought.
This village is deserted.
Despite there being evidence that people had just been living here.
What is this seam?
This isn't a normal crack between the rocks.
It seems to have some purpose.
Hey, you're acting like idiots!
Lucy, I found an extra big one!
R-Really?
But doesn't that look a bit suspicious?
Let me see...
Whoa, it's huge!
One of these'd last us for two days!
Why don't you two do something about the mushrooms on your heads?
Wait, Happy, don't!
It might be poisonous! Spit it out! Spit it out!
But it's yummy!
I guess everyone ends up like this.
I wonder how the people from the village ate them?
They all must have been like us!
I bet the name of that village is Mushroom Village!
It's not as funny the second time!
That's not the problem, here!
Wait a sec... I think your mushroom is growing.
Why does Natsu get all the good gags?
There's a second seam here.
What?
What's that?
Huh?
Your mushroom's disappeared!
Happy, you're the only one who still has one.
Erza, Gramps!
It's funny, but why's the joke on me?!
Erza!
Be careful, Happy!
Aye!
What the heck?
W-What's going on?
Wow! That's the first time a house ever waved at me!
That's what your focused on?
This is...
Let's do it, Gramps.
Wait!
Why?
Climb up high.
I want to check something.
Everyone, come.
Don't get separated!
I don't get this at all!
Master, that was a magic circle!
All those seams you found were part of a magic circle.
And that magic circle is the catalyst to activate the long banned sealing magic, Alive!
Alive?
Have a look.
It's as you see it.
A magic that turns formerly inanimate objects into living, moving creatures.
The people of the village activated such forbidden magic,
but they ended up as food for the monsters, not the other way around.
But why would they do something so dangerous?
This is a dark guild's village.
What?
When I investigated the shed at that first house, I found a number of magical tools.
And not a one of them was for good.
A dark guild, eh? They're probably plotting something evil and did themselves in.
However!
Their despair is our happiness.
Gramps, what are you talking about?
I did say that these things were alive, yes?
If they're alive...
Don't stand there naked with a creepy grin!
Well then, let's eat!
Yay, it's chow time!
At this rate we can't be picky about taste!
Erza, you're that hungry?
Food, food, food!
H-Hey!
Don't forget to save me some!
Hey jerks! You have any idea who you're dealin' with?
I'm the number one flame-griller in all of Fairy Tail!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
First, we cook'em nice and thorough...
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
And then...
Steam them covered for a bit.
Shouldn't really have dessert right off the bat, but beggars can't be choosers.
Ice Make Fishnet!
Sherbet is finished. Let's have a bite.
It's a close call which is more gross, a winged fish or a chair, but...
Erza!
Stand back.
It's cooking time.
C-Cooking?
Requip!
Each stick should be around 5 cm long.
With the width of 4 mm, that's the way.
You're taking this too seriously!
Besides, Erza... That outfit...
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
Ice Make Knuckle!
I'm starving...
Aren't they done yet?
Time to eat!
What are you doing?
It's not like you can eat a chair.
Lucy.
You try eating it first.
No, thank you!
Ah, well.
That's not right!
Why did you try and make me eat it first?
What is he doing?
I'm sure he'll handle it himself.
Now then...
What does it taste like?
O-Okay then...
Well, I guess it's time to try a piece.
Gross!
What the heck? I can't eat this, Gramps!
There's gross, and then there's this!
True. It's not something one would call, edible.
Don't say that after you made me eat it!
Your mushroom came off!
Who cares about that? Why didn't anyone stop that thing?
How cruel, Natsu! Why didn't you help?
You weren't playing around?
But this isn't helping. It doesn't matter how hungry we are, we can't eat this.
I guess that's what we get for trying to eat monsters.
Damn it! Now that I realize I can't eat it, I'm really getting hungry!
This is awful... To hell with friendship, to hell with my pals!
Watch out!
Natsu!
You disgusting creatures!
Now I'm angry.
I'll blow you all away at once!
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
Ice Wall!
Me, too!
Gate of the Golden Bull, I open thee!
Taurus!
Nice body as always, I see!
Yeah, whatever. Get to it.
Did y'all forget me?
Rampage!
There's no end to them.
W-What is it now?
A magic circle?
What's that?
Wow, pretty!
That's not the issue here!
You've been focusing on the weirdest things!
This is...
Run!
I'm starving...
Seriously!
I can't walk another inch...
Then stop showin' off with those wings of yours!
I don't get what happened at all.
Master.
What?
I don't accept your explanation of what happened before.
What did you do?
We made a magical circle, and a monster appeared.
All of us were Taken Over by it.
So you were all inside those monsters?
I ate a little of it!
When you outsiders entered the village,
you activated the magical circle.
That magic circle is no longer active!
Why, Gramps?
Don't sweat the details, my boy!
Anyway, you all should just be happy that the Take Over has been undone.
If you learn from this harsh lesson and never act in such a reckless manner again, I will refrain from informing the council!
What do you say?
I never want to experience this again!
I'm sorry.
We'll never do it again.
I thought that after we defeated the monsters we triggered a switch in the magic circle that would cause it to self-destruct.
But then, Master...
Run!
In an instant you saved us, and undid the Take Over spell on the dark guild members.
And erased the magic circle itself.
Isn't that right?
Could be!
At any rate...
We're starving!
Take me away to someplace!
Let's ride on a tin horse, just the two of us.
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
It's sad that my beloved doll can't talk to me...
(Go!Go! Let's go! Romance)
Every time I think of you tears start to flow...
I'm a crybaby, aren't I?
In the moon (the moon) at night (at night)
I'm always (I'm always)
searching for the rabbit!
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
so much it's like I'm under a spell.
This love is a monologue
from which I'll never awaken.
I'm at a loss for words (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
since I've completely fallen in love.
I wonder what spell I could chant,
to get through to you?
The perfect thing to say.
Spouting this and that,
I just love you like crazy!
One day I want to be able to tell you
You got me.
My words of thanks.
There's nothing more to say!
Natsu and Erza are actually going to fight?
That's right. Natsu has always hated to lose.
It's okay not to stop them?
Don't worry, they do this all the time.
Anyway, who do you think will win, Lucy?
Well, Erza I suppose... But then again I hope Natsu doesn't lose either...
Next time: Natsu vs. Erza!
Why don't you challenge Erza for the title of strongest female wizard?
Not a chance! But I might be able to beat Happy...
