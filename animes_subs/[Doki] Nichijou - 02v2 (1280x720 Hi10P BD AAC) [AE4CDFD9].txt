Auw!
eye catch
H!
O?!
I do fall in love!
I just realised it for the first time
That I had fallen in love
Twenty-four hours a day thinking of you, you and nothing more than you!
It's something I wasn't consciously aware of
Somehow ( somehow) I'm feeling different from the usual
With you ( the two of us) and our dull chatter
Don't tell me ( mutual love?) Nope, it's a one-sided crush
This is bad! Our gazes met!
What, what? Why is my heart pounding like this?
Did a short circuit just make a mess out of my mind?
This is my first time... feeling like this...
I wonder if I have a fever
Suddenly and precipitately, love has arrived.
Instantly igniting my face into a bright red
T-That's stupid?! My hands are shaking
Is this really what they call love?
I-I did it! A conversation filled with stutters
This awkward silence... *mumble mumble*
Your... ( Your...) I want to know your feelings.
O-One-sided love
First love! The usual way to school
The shining light. I do fall in love!
I feel I could fly towards the sky
O-One-sided love
10
H H!
Woke up in the morning, brushed my teeth
In the blink of an eye, it's 10pm
Today, we laughed a whole lot
We had a great time
At times, with my friends, acting like fools, being noisy
Fluttering, our eyes met.
It's a coincidence, right?
I wouldn't call this my first love
It's not my character.
Say, will we be able to meet again tomorrow?
As my eyelids close
I see you sparkling all over the place
Today was fun, too, wasn't it?
I'm in love
So happy, so happy
It is my pleasure to meet you, my new-found love.
Surely, we'll meet again tomorrow
Have a good night
We'll meet immediately in our dreams
So have a good night

All right!
Here goes!
Rock, paper, scissors!
Okay!
I'll be starting, then.
P-i-ne-app-le-s!
Rock, paper, scissors!
All right!
Here I go!
You can't do that!
The rule is to go up one step at a time.
I know!
Gu... ri... co... bonus!
H-Hey!
Heh?
What is it?
Why are you putting that at the end?
Eh?
You don't normally put bonus after it?
What do you say, Mai-chan?
Fifty-fifty.
I get it.
It's fine like that.
But if you're going to do that,
then I'll put my own rules into effect, okay?
Rock, paper, scissors!
You're next, then, Mai-chan.

It's the spell for revival.
It stopped.
Argh, Mum, I told you to wake me up at seven!
Mum!
Sepak...
Argh.
Even though I'm on day duty today.
Setting the alarm clock aside,
why did they have to cut the power today, of all days?
Really, I wish they'd warn us in advance if they're going to cut the power!
This sucks!
I'll just have to hammer out the fastest lap that I can.
That should be enough to...
I mean, just now...
There was something freaky there!
Above that...
It's coming!
What what what what!?
This sprinter!
Why... is it... following me!?
Impossible!
Um... Excuse me...
Did you drop a wooden mask?
Or maybe a golden one?
It'll get me.
If I don't do it,
it'll get me.
I'm sorry!
Sometimes, I'm a bear.
And sometimes...
Whose identity is...!
S-Sorry, sorry.
Tada!
The answer was your sister!
You didn't realise I was wearing the same school uniform as you, did you?
Ah, that was fun -
Oh, that is a fine corkscrew this early in the morning.
Yes.
It is indeed splendid!
It was a lot of work, you know, to stop your alarm clock as well.
You were the culprit?!
No, no, no.
Don't be so mad.
Here, I'll treat you to some ramen with this.
That was my pocket money!
chi-yo-ta ni-ke-ra ha-to-ho ra-su-te no-ha-te ki-ra-to na-ri-ha shi-te-to
A shark...
A shark!
I'm home!
Hm?
Professor, what are you up to?
Nano!
That cloud looks shark-ish!
Heh, which one?
Ah, it really does!
It looks cool.
Indeed it does.
Ah, yeah.
I brought it with me, Professor.
Milk.
Is it the 4.5?
The 4.5?
The 4.5 milk?
The 4.5 milk
Yes, it's the special one.
But what happened?
For you to want to drink milk so suddenly...
That is...
Because there's cake roll!
Why are you remodelling me without asking!?
Because it's a cake roll.
I don't understand!
Nano, the 4.5 is milk!
It's not 4.5!
Why do I have to live with a cake roll in my arm!?
It's cold and delicious!
I'm not talking about that!
What if someone outside saw this?
Professor...
What is it?
Um... Can I have some, too?
Okay.
Just a minute.
Here, go ahead.
Thank you very much.
Um...
Hm?
A little of that cake roll, too?
Ah, yeah!
I'll give the sweet bun to you, then, Nano.
Eh!?
Go ahead.
It went back in!
Sorry, I pressed the wrong one by mistake.
So, why are you doing these things?!
What would I do if it happened outside,
because of a bump of some sort?
What will happen?
I'm sure...
Commander Sunborn Master is the greatest!
Right!
I'll also make it so you can play music!
That's not the point!
How did this become about remodelling me even more?
Listen to me properly, please!
This much!
What is it?
Sweet bun!
You can't have it, since you already ate the cake roll.
Eh?
Professor?
It's okay,
since I still have some Baumkuchen left!
Eh, eh?
N-No way.
Where will it come out this time?!
Above?
Below?
P-Put them all in the refrigerator the first time, please!
No!
Eh?
Eh...
First comes rock, next comes paper, rockscispaper doesn't count,
rock paper scissors!
I'm so sleepy...
Mio-san.
What's that smile for?
Show me your notes!
Don't tell me you forgot your homework, again?
It's pretty embarrassing...
Geez.
If you keep that up, you're in for a painful experience on your exams again.
I get it.
But this time, only for this time...
I'll make this the last time, so please.
How about it?
Yukko.
That's what you said last time, too, isn't it?
There's no last time in ignorance!
No, I told you before...
Eh...
I-Is that so?
Oh, well... I guess there's nothing we can do.
Just this once, okay?
I mean it.
I get it.
One should always treasure their Mio-chan.
Yukko!
The one I told you about has appeared!
I'll give it back as soon as I've copied it.
Sure.
Really?
Show me, show me!
Huh?
Am I forgetting something?
Last night, I did my homework...
I did my homework...
I drew...
I drew a picture in there...
I won't let you do it!
I forgot!
Right? Right?
Yeah!
Yukko!
Sorry, sorry.
Come to think of it, I forgot to do my homework.
It beat me!
So that means, I'm taking my notebook back.
Sorry.
Eh?
What?
See, there's no point in looking...
Again?
Don't say that.
You said you'd lend it to me.
I'm off.
Sorry, I'm back now.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
If she sees that, she'll definitely think I'm weird.
Not to mention, if she sees that...
Especially if it's Yukko, she'll definitely tell...
Yukko!
T-That's my Japanese notebook.
This one's my maths notebook.
But this one's got Maths written on it.
You're wrong!
It hurt... my stomach hurt!
Okay.
Oh no.
I'll copy it right away.
Hold on for a bit.
Oh no.
If she sees it now...
My high school life will be...
Yukko.
That notebook... I'll buy it from you for 1000 yen!
Why are you running away?!
Yukko!
You've got it all wrong.
That notebook is... That notebook is...
It's useless.
There's no way I can chase down the running Yukko.
It's over.
My life is...
Thank you, my life.
Up until now it has been fun.
There were a few bad things, but it was a happy life.
But now it's over.
My life is over...
It's over.
Like. Hell. I'd. Let. It. Be. Over!
My life is blazing!
Even so, I still can't reach her.
Yukko!
Don't... run in the hallway!
Are... Are you all ri -
Here.
Okay, hand your notes in from the back.
After that, those who didn't do their homework, own up quickly.
An hour ago, I was wondering how I'd go on,
but it looks like I managed to survive just fine.
With this, my everyday life has returned...
Ah!
I didn't erase it!
What is it, Naganohara?
Sensei!
I forgot to do my homework!
Professor, can you help me clean up some of the mess in this room?
It might be a bit soon for the Professor.
I'm going to go play.
Um...
I said to that guy...
Um, excuse me.
Annaka-san, can I have a moment?
Yes?
It's just for a moment.
That ribbon, I wonder if it's a bit too big...
Pyon
Sweet buns are delicious, aren't they?
Indeed they are.
Sasahara, do you have any sense of responsibility as a Cultural Festival Executive Committee member?
You need to think seriously about it.
I am utterly diligent.
I'm the President of the Drama Club, so I'm always like that.
Do you not even understand that, Tachibana Misato?
No, I don't understand it!
Sweet.
Listen to me!
Besides, we're here to decide on the program for the cultural festival.
Your Drama Club has nothing to do with it!
The brand has changed?
Why did I end up paired together with this guy?
It's delicious.
Even I've got a tournament coming up in the Kendo Club...
Geez.
I shouldn't have joined the Cultural Festival Executive Committee.
Hey, you!
Why are you reading manga?
If we don't come up with something quickly,
we wont be able to return home.
Sorry.
It's a new release.
Don't you even have one idea?
Was the wine tasting championship idea I gave you earlier really not any good?
Obviously, it wasn't any good.
Rejected. Rejected! Absolutely rejected!
Hey, Sasahara?
You!
What have you been doing since earlier?
Sorry, had some piled up stuff.
Analog signal...
Sasahara, running away, huh?
I'm going to make a brief trip to the toilet.
Honestly...
It looks like she's in a really bad mood today.
As far as it concerns me,
the wine tasting championship would have been more than enough.
Nevertheless, she didn't bring up any ideas of her own.
If I tell her that, this time she may even take my life.
In other words,
if I don't come up with something it seems I won't be able to go home.
However, can my way of thinking drop to the level of a commoner?
Maybe I should try thinking seriously about it.
I-It's not like I have feelings towards you.
Asian innocence.
This is a sweet bun.
In Kansai, there seem to be many people who don't know whether to read it as Amashoku or Kamshoku
Next week's Nichijou is the third one.
Look forward to it.
