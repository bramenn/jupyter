H!
O?!
I do fall in love!
I just realised it for the first time
That I had fallen in love
Twenty-four hours a day thinking of you, you and nothing more than you!
It's something I wasn't consciously aware of
Somehow ( somehow) I'm feeling different from the usual
With you ( the two of us) and our dull chatter
Don't tell me ( mutual love?) Nope, it's a one-sided crush
This is bad! Our gazes met!
What, what? Why is my heart pounding like this?
Did a short circuit just make a mess out of my mind?
This is my first time... feeling like this...
I wonder if I have a fever
Suddenly and precipitately, love has arrived.
Instantly igniting my face into a bright red
T-That's stupid?! My hands are shaking
Is this really what they call love?
I-I did it! A conversation filled with stutters
This awkward silence... *mumble mumble*
Your... ( Your...) I want to know your feelings.
O-One-sided love
First love! The usual way to school
The shining light. I do fall in love!
I feel I could fly towards the sky
O-One-sided love

H H!
Woke up in the morning, brushed my teeth
In the blink of an eye, it's 10pm
Today, we laughed a whole lot
We had a great time
At times, with my friends, acting like fools, being noisy
Fluttering, our eyes met.
It's a coincidence, right?
I wouldn't call this my first love
It's not my character.
Say, will we be able to meet again tomorrow?
As my eyelids close
I see you sparkling all over the place
Today was fun, too, wasn't it?
I'm in love
So happy, so happy
It is my pleasure to meet you, my new-found love.
Surely, we'll meet again tomorrow
Have a good night
We'll meet immediately in our dreams
So have a good night

All right.
The test is now over.
Wow, they're really happy.
Everyone must have really given their all on this test.
That makes me happy.
The test is over; rock, paper,scissors!
That's not rock, paper, scissors!
It's like a dream!
It's over now.
It's all over now!
My parents are each going to give me a bag of rice!
Way to go, rice seller!
The two of us are getting married!
All right!
You guys, help out! One, two...
What... the... heck?!
Oh, Mio.
Good morning.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Where's your Eh?! Why are you wearing that?! reaction?
Aw, you're still mad, aren't you?
About what I did to your Mont Blanc yesterday...
Sticking a knight piece in it...
Well, it's not like it became inedible, so it's all right.
Of course it's not all right.
I was looking forward to that Mont Blanc!
What, what, what?! I don't get it!
Why would you stick a knight piece in it?!
Well...
I thought it would look cool.
Head!
She always takes jokes so badly.
Honestly, stupid Nee.
They only make ten of those Mont Blanc a day.
Without even knowing it, she's always messing with things.
She's a college student now.
She should pay attention to other people's pain.
But today, I have the capacity to forgive her actions.
Because I've hidden a shortcake that's limited to five a day...
Checkmate!
The strawberry!
The strawberry that I've been looking forward to since last night, which is limited to five a day!
My...
My...
Strawberry!
Where's the strawberry?!
Where's the sweet that goes in this position?!
Torso!
Come on, you idiot Nee!
A cake without a strawberry is no better than bread!
Nothing more than sweet bread!
Happy birthday to me.
Happy birthday to me.
Happy birthday dear Watashi.
Happy birthday to me.
Onee...
Mio.
It's not your birthday!
TL note: In Japan, a check means the answer is wrong, and a circle means it is correct.
I've always wanted to come here at least once.
You said it was mentioned in a magazine?
Yeah!
Look, I have a coupon and everything!
You don't need to go pulling that out yet.
I'll have nishin soba.
TL note: Nishin soba is soba with boiled herring on top.
Oh, even though it's so hot out, huh?
Without the herring.
That'd just be regular soba!
What are you gonna get, Mio-chan?
I'm probably just going to get zaru soba.
TL note: Zaru soba is a variety of chilled soba.
How unexciting.
That's really an amateur kind of thing to get.
There's nothing wrong with it.
What about you, Yukko?
I'm gonna go with the tendon with summer vegetables.
It's pretty daring going for a rice dish at a noodle place, huh?
So cool!
I know, right?
And it's a seasonal special, too.
Who knows when we'll have the chance to eat it again?
A year from now.
Man.
You have no dreams, Mio-chan.
The present is what's important. Now.
Oh, I see.
Well, you may be a bit too young for it, though, Mio-chan.
Sure, whatever.
Excuse me.
I'll be taking your order.
Nishin soba, zaru soba...
And also... tendon... with summer vegetables.
Nishin soba, zaru soba and summer vegetable tendon.
I will go put the order in.
It says right here that this store makes all their noodles by hand.
They're really serious about it, huh?
I wonder what this sobagaki is.
TL note: Sobagaki is a paste made from buckwheat, which is also used to make soba noodles.
It's those squishy balls of buckwheat.
Huh, is that right?
Thank you for waiting.
That's one nishin soba and one zaru soba.
Oh, you can go ahead and eat before me.
Sorry.
Before it gets cold.
Mine's already cold.
It must be because mine is a special menu item.
They take their time and make it carefully.
Yours sure is taking a while, Yukko.
I wonder if it's taking a long time to fry the tempura for it.
Maybe they went out to gather summer vegetables.
Ah, ha, so that's why it's so slow.
They apparently have a lot of a-la-carte dishes here, too.
Is that so?
Yes!
We were wrong.
Too bad.
Goddamn!
Hey, Yukko, calm down!
How can I?! It's so slow! It's too slow!
No matter how far they go to preserve the taste,
they aren't preserving the heart!
You're not making sense!
I'll definitely submit a complaint!
Sorry for the wait.
Wasn't that a bit too slo -
Thank you.
Oh, read a magazine or something.
I'll finish right away.
Things you think are cool!
Child Shogi Pros!
My mosquito coil and repellent are in place.
I figured I could just wait and it'd go away.
But it never fades, like the Mogami River in the dead of night.
They say that even a tiny mosquito has half a soul.
Just accept it and sleep peacefully.
You will!
Yes!
Chest!
Such a worthless death.
I'll kill you!
I hit.
And I hit.
But there's no effect.
I don't know what's what any more!
Mum!
This house is no good any more!
We have no choice but to move!
Do you have any idea what time it is?!
Be quiet and go to sleep!
Chirashizushi.
TL note: Chirashizushi is a kind of sushi.
Now you.
No. Chi Ra Shi Zu Shi.
Now you.
Non, non.
Chi.
Chi.
Ra.
Ra.
Shi.
Shi.
Zu.
Zu.
Shi.
Shi.
Yes!
Chirashizushi.
Now you.
Sakamoto!
Look, look!
I got a winner on the bottom of the popsicle!
Why aren't you excited?!
You shouldn't be eating that kind of thing.
What do you mean by that kind of thing?!
You won't be able to finish your dinner.
Omelette rice.
You're such a kid, getting excited over something like a winning popsicle.
It's not just a winner!
It's on the bottom! It's super-rare!
Top or bottom, it's still just a winner.
Of course there are times when the winner is on that side.
Man, you're such a blissful kid.
You're getting way too happy over a winner.
A crab!
This is something super-rare!
I'll save this one for last -
Thanks for the meal.
Huh? You haven't eaten at all, Professor.
Were you eating lots of snacks this afternoon?
I'm sorry.
Come on. How much of the snacks did you eat from the pantry?
All of them.
All of them?!
You ate all of this month's?!
I'm not praising you!
Honestly, now.
But Sakamoto told me to eat them!
Sakamoto-san?!
But Sakamoto said that food rots more quickly in the summer!
That's not related!
They say that snacks go in a different stomach!
Are you an office lady in the afternoon?!
Sakamoto-san!
Why are you going along with this?
I am completely innocent!
It's black and white! Or rather, it's white!
You're completely black, Sakamoto.
She's right.
That's how I was born!
That's enough.
You won't listen to anything I say, anyway.
And so, I am taking your strawberry juice, Professor.
I won't eat snacks any more!
Too bad.
I'll give you my winning popsicle!
I don't want it.
I'll eat all my vegetables!
Of course you will.
I'll remove the key!
I'll forgive you just this once.
If it happens again, you're going a month without snacks.
Okay!
Well, then.
It feels like if I give it to her now, she won't do it in the end.
You can have the juice after you've removed the key.
Then turn around.
Okay!
Your right hand is a loser.
Why did you install something like that?!
I'm not praising you!
You're too impulsive, Professor.
You should think more about your actions.
She's not listening!
Rock!
Paper!
Scissors!
If you look, you really can find anything...
Oh, Mio.
Perfect timing.
What's up, Onee?
I had some urgent business come up.
Could you help out at the neighbourhood association's stall in my place?
What?
You should ask mum for something like that.
Mom's out playing sepak takraw with her friends.
Besides, you'll get paid 10,000 yen.
Well, thanks.
I'm happy to get paid 10,000 yen.
I had nothing else to do, anyway. Maybe I'll check it out.
I've been tricked!
This is awful.
What the heck is this?
How did I get fooled into this?
And for a neighbourhood association stall,
it's just the two of us selling daihuku on the street!
It's embarrassing!
It's embarrassing!
Everyone is looking at me with pity.
Am I supposed to draw in customers?
As the mascot character, Daihuku-kun?
There are no eyes or even a mouth.
It's just a white mask.
This isn't Daihuku-kun...
It's a daihuku!
Wait a minute... This Daihuku Fair...
It's not a fair!
I'm sor -
There's no way this will work.
Oh, what's that?
It looks gross!
Take that!
Stop that!
It's starting to hurt, so stop!
Hey, stop!
There's no protection at the bottom!
There's no protection at the bottom!
Hey, stop!
It got angry.
Run away!
What now...
Yukko!
Please, don't destroy the image of the Daihuku.
I can't watch this.
Hurry, take it off.
This is why I can't stand part-timers.
Don't just stand there and stare. Go manage the stand.
It's for 10,000 yen pay.
I have to endure.
I want leave.
I miss my home.
But will these sell?
They're pretty neatly placed.
Excuse me.
How much for one?
It's a customer.
Wait, how much are they?
Excuse me, how much are -
So my daring enterprise ends in ruin?!
I won't run away. I'm not going to run away after one little setback like this!
Just take it for free.
How lucky.
Take that!
The Shinonome household was peaceful again today.
Hello! I'm the King!
When you think of shogi, you think of Habu-san!
TL note: Habu Yoshiharu is a famous shogi player. Habu is also a breed of snake which hunt mongooses.
When you think of Habu-san, you think of mongooses!
Now I want to go on a trip to Okinawa!
Nankuranaisa!
TL note: Okinawan speech. Its meaning is akin to Don't worry.
Next time on Nichijou is episode 10!
Look forward to it!
