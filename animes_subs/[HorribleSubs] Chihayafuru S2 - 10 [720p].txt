Taichi.
Huh? What?
Stay focused.
If Arata comes to watch us,
I want to show off my team, and how strong we are.
Watch us play, Arata.
This is the second round of the group stage...
We're up against Yamaguchi Mioka High School.
Mioka...
Yamaguchi Mioka?!
Yamaguchi Mioka is the
public school with the most students accepted to Tokyo University!
The star of public high schools...
They're all wearing glasses.
Desktomu-kun times five...
Huh?
He started placing the cards from the left after shuffling them?
They all used that method?!
So there's no pattern to their placement?!
They're that confident in their memorization skills?
Wait, that's not what we should be worrying about...
The three guys over there
won the All Japan High School Quiz Championship!
Why are they playing karuta?
Why do we keep getting matched against weird opponents?
The five of you have to get us there!
We absolutely have to win!
It doesn't matter how distinguished their school is.
It doesn't matter if they're quiz champions.
We've spent so much time on competitive karuta!
We can do this, guys!
Hey, Captain!
Chihaya Furu

You may be barred from playing in the tournament tomorrow.
No unauthorized personnel allowed
What do we do?
There's never been an incident with substituting before.
I could ask a friend of mine who coaches baseball.
Wait, baseball is tough on violations.
We should look towards a sport that isn't as harsh.
Letting this slide won't teach our students anything.
Committee Member Masuoka Masato (Grade 6)
If his purpose here is to participate in the individual tournament,
it is our duty as educators to punish him by taking that away.
B-But, you must realize...
They're close acquaintances
So they can't say anything
Wataya Arata-kun is special.
Because he's the grandson of an Eternal Master?
No, that's not why.
He's a truly marvelous karuta player.
Hello
I dare say that Master Suo can
only be defeated if Wataya-kun continues to mature.
Sunglasses aren't allowed?
I can't deny that Master Suo is strong.
Why not?
But his strange behavior makes it difficult to use
him as a role model for children.
I truly believe that it is our duty to nurture Wataya-kun's growth!
So much pressure on Arata-kun!
So much hate for Master Suo.
I don't know if I'll graduate this year.
He's right...
Master Suo is the biggest headache the karuta world has ever seen.
Honestly, I want to see him lose as soon as possible,
I don't know when I will graduate.
but that doesn't make this right...
Excuse me!
It wasn't Arata's fault!
I asked him to sit down with us!
He helped make this tournament memorable for us!
We weren't trying to cheat our way to victory!
We just wanted to be able to play a match!
Shoji!
Please let Arata play in the individual tournament!
Shoji!
I beg you! I beg you!
Is that so?
In that case...
They can't do that!
I have to accept my punishment.
Arata...
But...
I'm focused on winning the individual tournament.
I'm not interested in team tournaments.
Thank you...
Thank you, Arata.
You should have started a team.
I was just jealous.
Jealous that Taichi and Chihaya had their own team.
Next time, we'll meet in a match. Arata
Sorry...
I'm sorry...
Yamaguchi Mioka High School Karuta Advisor Oikawa Tomonari (38)
Excuse me...
Are you the coach for Yamaguchi Mioka High School?
I'm Miyauchi, the advisor for Mizusawa.
Oh, hello.
I'm very surprised.
Your members are all third-years.
They chose to participate in this tournament when they're
probably busy studying for college exams?
Yes, karuta is very useful in studying for college exams.
Oh, is that so?
It lets students train their concentration and memorization through a game.
A convenient tool.
I'm not too interested in winning,
but it's funny how we're beating schools that spend
all their time practicing competitive karuta.
My, that's terrifying.
Beat the crap out of them.
Spends all her time practicing karuta
Especially you, Ayase-san!
My life means nothing...
The storm will soon carry...
What now?
My style is big on attacking the opponent's side,
but I've never seen cards placed evenly in the middle like this!
This makes it easier for me to make mistakes!
I need to memorize!
I'm moving my cards.
Huh?!
He...
He moved all of them!
so I wish for a memory of you to take with me
Stay calm!
If I focus, I can memorize their positions!
None are left...
A dead card!
I moved because he did!
Chihaya, be careful.
I was thinking that they were
a bunch of intellectuals who were giving karuta a try,
but they understand karuta.
They're good.
She typically places None are towards the upper left.

Such mistakes can arise when you stick
to certain placements.
Nicknamed Poseidon
Karuta is very fascinating.
My first encounter was a year ago.
When Sasaki from the karuta club came to see me for advice.
You want us to practice with you?
You can draw parallels between buzzer pressing and karuta,
so it might help.
It all began when I watched the DVD with the Master and Queen matches.
This is...
Exactly like buzzing in early and the lag effect!
Question: The Winter Triangle is formed by Procyon, Si
At that point,
you can guess the rest is Sirius, and what?
Betelgeuse!
It's exactly like unique syllables in competitive karuta.
As this trip takes me away...
Humans aren't machines.
If I buzz in after hearing The Winter Triangle is formed by Procyon,
the moderator will still say part of the next word.
The Winter Triangle is formed by Procy
on, Si
Oops
If I can catch that extra syllable,
I have what they call game sense in karuta.
He knew which card to go for after As?
No way...
I'm moving my cards.
What?!
I have to memorize their positions again!
I don't have any game sense to speak of.
I just have decision-making skills!
Gust of wind...
I'm losing my sense.
I'm moving my cards.
Huh?!
Nakayama...
I'm his teacher, and I'd have to describe his intelligence
and memory as freakish.
hence the name fall leaves
You have to press the button before you can answer.
Inspiration...
You have to trust in that moment of inspiration
and attack!
Above all, he has guts.
For you, I head out to the fields to pick spring greens
A multi-syllable card! Got it!
I'm relieved that I was able to keep my own card?
This is how I play karuta?
Really?
May the time we spend...
How many cards did I hit?!
I took a card from the opponent's side, but I was just forcing it!
What was that?
Scary...
Wasn't that the Queen?
So she really did lose weight.
Shinobu-chan's back to the weight she was at when we played.
Have I grown at all?
What are you doing, Shinobu-chan? You're soaked.
What happened to the Birdman rally?
Uh, what? Again?
Shinobu-chan, I won't be able to play in the individual tournament.
I broke one of the rules.
Good luck tomorrow.
Mr. Masuoka.
If Wataya Arata isn't playing, I forfeit.
What?!
What are you talking about, Wakamiya-san?!
The Queen can't drop out of the tournament!
Yeah, you shouldn't joke around...
I don't know what you did,
but stop acting cool and lower your head!
Beg them to let you play!
I'm also asking you to let him play.
Wh-Why are you doing this, Shinobu-chan?
I didn't get to watch the Birdman rally, and now...
Can you not disappoint me any further?
Do you not want to play against me?
What will Shinobu-chan and Arata see when they watch me?
I'm no longer the high school first-year me...
No longer the sixth grade me...
Omi Learning Center
We finally made it!
I'm completely drenched!
What do I do now?
I can't go watch the match by the main office.
Everyone else is running around,
but that person with glasses is taking it easy...
I really appreciate it!
Thanks.
Hanano-san?
You actually thought to bring an umbrella?
The forecast said the chance of rain was low.
Well, the JMA and the websites I checked said it would be sunny,
but the Japan Weather Association
said that there was a chance for showers.
O-Oh...
How was the Akashi Girls' match?
Here are the notes I took.
How do you think our match went?
There are a lot of people so it's not easy to get in.
First Akashi Girls' all look ordinary Girl in front (with long hair) Pink checkered handbag (Ponita) white hand towel pink macaroon phone strap
I was too far away to see the cards,
Girl with glasses (ordinary, sharp-tongued, popular) black handbag with a charm attached white plain towel... cell
but I wouldn't have understood what was going on anyway.
Thanks, Hanano-san!
Even the color of their socks...
This is more than enough information.
I was so relieved
when you didn't suddenly tell me to play in a match this time!
That was a big shock at the Tokyo regional!
Just to be clear, I'm not interested in playing in the national championship!
I'm fine with scouting other teams!
Unlike everyone else, I don't have the fighting spirit to be a player!
I'll try to consolidate these notes,
so grab some lunch when you have a chance.
O-Okay...
I thought that everyone else in our club was itching to play in matches,
but Komano-senpai might be different.
Makes sense to me.
The world of karuta is too competitive and intense. Who wants that?
This is turning out to be a good match.
Nakayama, your drive to challenge yourself has always impressed me.
To think that you would work so hard at karuta
for the sake of doing well in the quiz championship.
That's probably what the coach is thinking...
However, in reality...
I work hard at the quiz championship for the sake of karuta.
Huh? Really?
I love this atmosphere.
He's a freak...
The tension before a card is read.
So silent, you can hear people breathe.
Wow, she has crazy lung capacity.
Chihaya, you can win if you just breathe.
Excuse me...
I can feel it rushing in.
I can see it.
She's kinda pretty.
Star-wise, she's a Vega.
Orihime...
I don't mind it when she looks down on me.
Sorry about that.
Oops, I'm wasting my brainpower on unnecessary thoughts!
How's everyone else doing?
In the back
We're losing the other three except the one in the back?!
I'm moving my cards.
What? Again?
Doesn't really matter.
I don't know why he doesn't get it.
Our Suihoku society teaches defensive karuta.
The opponent can change his placement around as much as he wants.
My goal is to prevent him from taking any of the 25 cards on my side.
By making that my priority,
I'm somehow able to take the opponent's cards, as well.

A poem by the blind monk Semimaru.
Check...
There are six poems by monks on the field...
My fear is not of being forgotten,
Got it!
This poem was written by Ukon about her attachment to a man who left her.
There are four poems by women on the field.
I'm moving my cards.
This girl is impressive.
I keep shuffling my cards around and it doesn't faze her.
If he's randomly placing his cards,
then I won't bother remembering them by position.
I'll admit that it's impressive.
Their style has no fixed card placement
and frequently moves the cards around.
But in karuta, you're only allowed to move your arm.
Against opponents who aren't great at memorization,
his swing is fast enough.
But I'm good at memorization.
I can understand.
Their emphasis is on memorization and accuracy.
That's how I play karuta.
You need mental and physical strength to play karuta!
I only memorize about half the cards.
Nishida was trying to teach me that
your body is important too!
It takes both mind and body...
I can't let her get into a groove.
I'm moving my cards.
And heart...
Again?! How many times is that?!
Wow! Can he really memorize them?!
Kill! Kill!
That's impossible for me.
I could never do that.
Yes, that's me...
Can memorize
Can't memorize
I belong to the group that can't memorize too well!
Once I realized that, I felt a lot better.
While I sigh and lament...
Stay calm.
When the misty bridge...
I'm moving my cards.
This is the first time I've faced someone who keeps moving his cards.
Stay calm.
If I stick it out long enough...
There, they're almost all one-syllable cards now.
I'm moving my cards.
He's moving them back now,
and he moved them to a strange spot.
It's go time.
Note that though...
She moved the instant the reader spoke.
She moved faster than sound!
When I must hide...
I don't even get a chance to move.
I trust my inspiration and attack.
My inspiration travels through my brain...
But in her case...
It goes straight from her ear to her finger!
She's no Orihime.
She's as sharp as...
The Amazon Star!

Wake up, Chihaya!
You were so close, Kana-chan! You lost by two cards!
I was close, too!
Come on, Chihaya!
You lost by 12 cards!
You all did well.
It hurts to lose in the group stage,
but this experience will help in the future.
I'm sure it'll help in the Quiz Championship!
It won't help...
It doesn't have to help!
This loss was a loss in karuta...
I'll avenge it by playing karuta!
You guys are so smart
and so dumb.
Good work, everyone!
Congratulations on advancing to the playoffs!
I brought some homemade cookies!
I won't have any
How did the other schools do?
Was it rough moving around in the rain, Komano?
It was no problem!
Oh, speaking of which, the Queen was completely drenched.
Oh, I saw that!
It was scary!!
She walked in dripping wet,
then she helped this person in a Fukui T-shirt and begged
them to let him play in the individual tournament.
Because she wanted to play him.
So the Queen has a rival.
It's Arata.
Arata and Shinobu-chan...
Because she wants to play him...
Sumire-chan, can you tell me what
We don't have time for that right now!
Taichi.
Let's come up with the order for our next match.
Stop it.
Queen and Arata.
Those words will distract Chihaya.
I need her to focus on the team match.
So Arata is...
here.
Uh...
I believe that Komano-senpai should
be a starting member for the playoffs.
What's that?
You're tired, so you want to switch out?!
Bingo!
So you must not want to play that badly.
You're wrong!
Komano-senpai will know better how to use all the data he's collected!
That's right.
Either Tsukuba-kun or I can drop out.
What do you think, Desktomu-kun?
Yes... I'd say...
Wait.
I think we should use the
same members we've been using for the next match.
Huh?
I think we should go without Desktomu-kun.
