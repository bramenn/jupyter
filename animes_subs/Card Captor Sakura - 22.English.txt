I'm so sorry.
I set my alarm to a wrong time'
G'morning.
G'morning, Father.
G'morning, Touya, Sakura'
Oh? I thought today's breakfast is my'
We just ate. This is yours.
It's ready. Eat.
Thank you.
You didn't sleep much last night, did you?
From today on, let us do the housework.
The academic meeting is next week, right?
Thank you. And thanks for the food.
Here's your lunch.
Oh? Lunch? This'
Somehow I felt confident today.
Thank you.
I won't be as busy next week.
Don't worry about it.
Isn't it about time already?
Oh?! Then, I gotta go.
Take care.
I made lunch and did the dishes.
A perfect score today.
Oh? You're leaving already?
Morning practice.
I'm meeting up with Yuki.
Wa' Wait! I'm going too!
Father, Keep it up at work!
Okay!
The total comes to 700 yen.
Can I have a bag for this?
Oh, you two are doing the housework?
Yeah. Father said he'll be reading
A very important paper at this academic meeting.
That's why Touya and I discussed and decided to do that.
We would do all the housework
so Father can concentrate on work just this week.
When is the research announcement?
Next Monday. That's why it seems that now is the busiest time.
That is very nice of you two. Teamwork from you and your brother.
It's not that big of a deal.
Oh, how about this book?
Then I will take this too'
With this many, I think I will do fine. Thank you very much.
But what are you doing with all these books about flowers?
Recently, I have come to a bit of deadlock'
I was thinking of doing some research for a new motif.
Mo' Motif?
Of course! This is for your costume design!
Eh!
Because you made all the effort to wear them for me'
I must always put in new thoughts and ideas.
Tomoyo'
Thank you very much.
Excuse me, I came to pick up a pre-ordered book'
May I have your name please?
Kinomoto.
Yukito!
Touya asked you to get it for him, didn't he?
Yeah. His club practice has gotten a little long.
It looks like your father needs this book
in a hurry'
Oh, then it's a book Father pre-ordered.
Thank you very much.
Not at all. I heard from Touya that
you worked very hard for your father.
It wasn't anything at all'
Here it is.
Thanks.
I'm sure everything will go well.
Because you put in all these efforts to help.
See you later.
Yukito'
Father is working late tonight too'
Sakura'
Did you fold the laundry?
Yeah, I finished it a while ago.
Okay. Then, I've one more thing for you.
What is it?
Can you bring Father his midnight snack?
Okay!
Father's still working, so don't stay in there for too long.
Also, it's getting late, so go to sleep!
I came to bring you midnight snack.
Maybe I'll eat it now. It's good to take a little break.
It's good.
Are you almost done?
I'm just about done gathering data,
but putting them together will take a while.
I'll be fine.
I'll just have to stay at the university for two to three days,
and I can probably finish it at home on Saturday.
I give you and Touya so much trouble,
next week after the announcement is over'
Don't worry about things like that. Just concentrate on work.
Thanks.
So, what kind of people
are you presenting this to?
Are there going to be lots of famous people?
How should I put it'
Those people attending aren't any famous people in particular.
Yes!
We live in a big world,
and it has been a long time since human beings were born.
But what we know is actually very little.
Living in different countries, speaking different languages,
those people who lived in different times
We hardly know anything about them.
That's why this is what I do for work.
Things about the ancient times, about the ancient countries.
I want to learn about them, research on them.
And then, I announce my result, because I want to tell someone about them.
Rather than keeping something you enjoy to yourself,
it's more fun to let everyone know about it, right?
Yeah!
Thanks for the midnight snack.
One more day of hard work and it should be done.
Now, you need to get up early tomorrow too, right?
Yeah. Good night.
G'night.
Goin' to your father's school?
Why don't you come along too?
I don't need to study. I'm already so smart.
No, I'm thinking of bringing him some snacks.
He's staying there overnight and probably even has a change of clothes.
Oh, maybe I'll ask Tomoyo to come with me too.
Tomoyo too?
Oh, she's gonna bring cookies, right?
All you care is the food.
Okay, it's decided!
Let's go to the university on Saturday!
But I'm glad for you, Sakura.
Eh!
The entrance exams to the university must be real hard, right?
You can get in without takin' the exam, aren't you lucky or what?
What do you mean by that'
Universities are really big.
I wonder where your father is.
Um' The department of history in the faculty of literature'
Let us ask someone.
Thanks very much for coming with me.
Not at all. I am happy to be able to come with you.
Oh, that's right. Thanks to the books I bought yesterday,
I had a nice idea for your new costume.
It is very cute.
Do you need some help?
Um' I would like to get to the faculty of literature'
Faculty of literature?
Yes.
Who do you need to see from the faculty of literature?
Kinomoto from the department of history.
Oh? Professor Kinomoto?
Do you know my father?
Oh, you are Professor Kinomoto's daughter?
Yes, I'm Sakura Kinomoto.
You're cute.
Hey, Sakura,
do you want to see your father's lecture?
Is that really okay?
Look, over here.
In this way, the ancient,
which spreaded agriculture
that originated from Mesopotamia to Europe,
has a very important implication.
The widespread knowledge of how to grow
wheat, barley, and soya bean,
and even things like pottery and ceramics'
'could be seen distinctively'
Your father is wonderful.
Professor Kinomoto's lectures are popular.
He made them really interesting.
When I first came to this university,
I never thought history is this interesting.
We are
Professor Kinomoto's assistants.
We help him with various research projects.
I see.
Um' Thanks for helping Father out all this time.
Not at all. We thank him for helping us too.
Lecture is almost over. Now, let's go.
Come in!
Professor Kinomoto, your daughter is here.
Sakura?
Sorry for bothering you.
Hello.
Oh my God. Why do you come'?
We brought snacks.
Thanks for taking the trouble, Sakura, Tomoyo.
I'm in here too!
Professor, we'll be in the data research room.
Data research room?
As you see,
just myself and these books are already taking lots of space here.
The three of them use the data research room next door.
They're all staying behind to help out with this.
It sounds like very tough work.
Not really, we'll be fine.
Thanks to them,
things are wrapping up here.
Sakura, you guys also helped a lot.
I didn't really do anything at all. But I'm glad.
You work so hard all this time, I was thinking what if you can't make it in time.
Sakura'
Father'
Father'
Maybe he is tired'
I'm sorry. I didn't have much sleep, that's why'
Father is sleepy.
It's probably because of the all-nighters.
But Kero seemed to be asleep all along.
What are you talkin' about?!
I was desperately hidin'! I didn't fall asleep!
Then what's that mark of the basket on your cheek?
But I wonder if there is anything else I can help with.
Right.
How about bringing them coffee
to help them stay awake?
That's a good idea!
Thank you very much!
It looks like Father isn't in here.
It does not seem so.
Come in!
Oh, it's Professor Kinomoto's daughter.
Excuse me, Father wasn't there.
He left the room just for a little bit
to talk to another professor.
I see. Oh, I brought coffee for everyone. Please help yourself.
Thanks.
They fell asleep?
They are all tired.
I wonder why. Just a second ago, they were'
Kero, this is'
It's a Clow Card!
I'm sure it's in this room!
There it is!
That's Sleep!
If its powder falls on you,
you'd feel sleepy!
Then just now, when Father was feeling sleepy'
There's no mistake.
Sleep doesn't care
and would make anyone fall asleep.
No way!
If I don't seal it quickly,
Father will never finish his work!
Key which hides the forces of darkness,
reveal thy true form before me!
I, Sakura, command thee under contract.
Release!
Eh!
What's wrong?!
I did not bring Sakura's new costume with me.
Watch out!
Tomoyo!
Jump!
Return to thy form which thou should be!
It went outside!
Everyone is asleep!
Crap!
Where is it?!
Over there!
Windy!
Return to thy form which thou should be!
Clow Card!
That hurts.
Did you seal Sleep?
It was a success, wasn't it?
What's wrong?
Father's work'
Crap'
Maybe there's a card I can use to restore this back to the original'
Sakura'
I tried every single card!
But none of them worked'
It would've been nice if the cards could solve any problem.
There are things even cards and magics wouldn't work.
Father'
Oh? Sakura?
What's wrong?
I thought that you were sleepy,
so I brought you some coffee'
I'm sorry'
I'm sorry' for messing up your work'
There's nothing you can do if something is ruined.
Come on. Smile.
I wonder where is that coffee you brought in for me.
Father'
Let's go home together after I'm done with the coffee.
Sakura, how long are you gonna stay awake?
Your father has already forgiven you, you know?
But'
Things about the ancient times,
about the ancient countries.
I want to learn about them, research on them.
Father'
G'morning.
That's early for you on a Sunday.
Where is Father?
He's awake but he said he was gonna tidy up his room.
Is it?
Touya?
You won't have energy if you don't eat.
Yes!
It hurts.
It's hard to tidy up
since I have so many things scattered around.
It's okay. Just leave them where they are.
Father' I'm really sorry!
Sakura.
If there's anything I can do, just tell me.
If it's something I can do,
I'll do it.
Please!
Sakura.
I thought about it last night,
but the paper for the announcement is almost done.
But I ruined it'
I still have the contents of the paper' in here.
If I work on it all day today,
I might be able to finish it on time.
But I need the help of a capable assistant.
I'll help you!
Then you'll be my assistant for one day.
Let's work hard together.
I'll work hard. I'll do my very best for it!
Then, what should I do? Tell me. Tell me.
You finished it.
Father'
Then I'll be going!
Take care.
I wonder if Father hasn't gotten any sleep.
He was more afraid
of being tempted to fall asleep like you did.
You're mean!
Oh? You're leaving already?
Morning practice. I'm meeting up with Yuki.
Wait! I'm going with you!
He had a little bit of spare time.
If he had time for this, he should've just rest for a little.
(Thank you, Sakura. Work hard!)
Father'
Hey! Wait for me!
