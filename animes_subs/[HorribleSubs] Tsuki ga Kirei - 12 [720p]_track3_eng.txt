1658 General Studies Kotarou Azumi Not Accepted
I've lived a life full of embarrassments.
Sorry.
I didn't get in.
It's okay.
You worked so hard for me.
That's more than enough.
Thanks.
I'm going to apply for a municipal school.
Okay.
Yeah?
You know...
They say nothing an author goes through is in vain.
It all gets put to use in writing.
Why not write?
You might feel a little better.
That's how it goes sometimes.
Yeah.
What are you going to do now?
With your boyfriend.
Long distance?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
About what?
Boys see that kind of thing as a hassle.
I don't want to see you cry.
I'll be fine.
Why don't you break up?
You're a jerk, Nee-chan.
I can't stop you if you like him, I guess.
Azumi-kun: Are you awake?
I'm done studying
Good job
Thanks
What's up?
Making this
That gives me strength
Good!
Okay, see you at school
Yup, goodnight
Goodnight, sleep rhine
Acceptance Announcements
Exam Ticket Candidate No. 1067
I got in
Congrats
Hey.
Did you get in?
Yeah.
Me, too!
Yay!
I was actually kind of worried.
We'll be together in high school, huh?
Looking forward to it.
Me, too.
I'm super, super happy.
It's not that big of a deal.
It is.
I feel a bit bad for Akane, though.
Sorry, should I stop talking about this?
It's fine.
What are you going to do now?
With Akane.
What? I guess...
we'll keep things the way they've been.
Hey, I was never able to tell you...
Especially since Akane's a friend, and I don't want to hurt her...
But...
I have to tell you properly.
I've always liked you, Kota.
Would I not be good enough?
Sorry.
I'm glad I got that out.
I'll see you in high school.
Right.
Okay, later.
Yeah.
Self Study
Thanks! Let's hang out after we know where we're going, just the three of us!
Yeah! I can't wait
I passed
Congrats!
And then
I confessed to Azumi-kun
He rejected me, of course
Sorry, Akane
Nah
Will you still be my friend?
Yup!
Thanks!
Now that exams are over
Kotarou-kun
Want to hang out?
Let's do it!!
How about the day after grad?
Sure
Okay, it's a promise
Pinky promise
Prologue If there's such a thing as a god of fate, he must be quite a troll. He's a real jerk, always setting up seeming coincidences just to bewilder us for his own entertainment. But right now, I wouldn't mind thanking that jerk of a god. He hooked us up on equipment duty of all things, after all. It was spring when I met her.
Crying already?
We're going to be BFFs, okay?
Azumi!
Come on, stand closer, Azumi.
Okay, here we go.
You're both so stiff.
All right, see you.
Okay.
Thanks.
You lucky bastard!
You looked like crap, Kota.
Really?
Your eyes were dead.
I stayed up all night writing.
Are you writing again, Sensei?
I guess.
What's it about?
I'm not telling you.
You're writing smut, aren't you?
I bet you are!
I'm not.
I want to read it.
Hell no.
What's the point in writing, then?
Post it on a novel board.
A what?
Mizuno.
You better keep running in high school.
Yeah.
You, too.
I'll see you on the field again.
Yeah.

Akane-chan.
Sorry.
Did I keep you waiting?
No.
Moving must be a lot of work.
We're used to it.
It's tomorrow, huh?
Yeah.
When can we meet again?
Whenever.
Can I come visit you?
Yeah.
I'll come every week.
Yeah...
Should I not?
No, I mean, train fare costs a lot.
I'll find work.
I will, too.
What about track?
I want to continue, but...
Don't worry, I'll go.
I can make enough for train fare if I work, like, three times a week.
But...
Two hours each way?
Yeah.
I'll take the first train.
So we can have more time.
It'll be the same as always.
We have LINE, too.
But...
You're taking on the whole burden.
It'll be fine.
I have money saved up, too.
Don't worry about it.
That's not it!
Akane-chan...
I want to ask you something.
Okay.
Did she confess to you?
Chinatsu told me.
She did.
Why?
Why didn't you tell me?
Well...
I turned her down.
Shouldn't you tell me that?
I get worried.
What's wrong?
I don't know, but...
Why?
I keep getting anxious.
So anxious...
I keep causing trouble for you.
That's what hurts me the most.
What should I do?
Honey, can I throw this out?
What is this?
Don't get in the way of the movers.
Mom, the movers are calling you.
Tell Dad.
Akane, do you have everything?
Yeah.
That's everything.
Crap, my nose hurts.
Got it.
Thanks for everything, guys.
I'm going to be so lonely.
Not again...
Stop it, would you?
Come on, please!
See you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Akane!
Want to catch the train later?
Can I?
Your friends are here.
Don't you want more time to talk with them?
Yeah.
Hey, Akane.
What about Azumi-kun?
Oh, yeah, well...
Oh, wait, hang on.
Look.
I found this.
She was a 100-meter sprinter. When she set a new personal record, I was so ecstatic that I could have been the one who ran.
I'm the president of the literature club. I would watch her run along the track as I ran my pen along paper.
My work never got published, but you said I was awesome anyway.
Isn't this...
The first day we met at the shrine, I was so nervous that I couldn't say a word.
About me and Kotarou-kun?

of howling words of love with the desperation of a man jumping into high seas.

No.

End...
I want to tell her that no matter how far apart we are,
my feelings for her will never change.
You're leaving for an unfamiliar town.
I love you!
And I'll always love you.
She was my first love.
I knew nothing.
I was so nervous.
How to hold hands, how to kiss...
We'd never even told our friends.
It was so embarrassing.
I never had any idea what to do.
But that day, he found the courage to tell me.
I could believe we would always walk together.
To think someone I loved would love me back...
I thought it must have been a miracle.
