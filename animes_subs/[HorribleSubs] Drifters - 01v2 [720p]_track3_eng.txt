Around 2:00 p.m.
Sekigahara
Don't mess with Shimazu!
Oorah!
This battle has already been decided.
Fukushima Masanori-Eastern Army Commander
Forget Ukita and Ishida- the entire Western Army is routed.
In this final moment...
What are you thinking?
D-Don't mess with...
Please allow me to inform you!
Commander Fukushima was unable to withstand Shimazu's fierce attack!
Could you assist us with pursuit?!
Ii Naomasa General of the Eastern Army
Got it.
Act 1 Fight Song
Utouzaka
Our lives for the commander!
-Toyohisa! -Please withdraw!
Uncle! Please withdraw!
From here on, leave it to me!
Shimazu Yoshihiro-Western Army General
What?! You're returning to Satsuma, too, Toyohisa!
I do want to go back. If I'm to die, I want to die in Satsuma.
But even if I and all these troops die here, as long as you return to Satsuma,
this battle is a victory for us!
Rearguard! Form up!
It's time to die!
Our enemy is Ii Naomasa's Red Devils,
the greatest foe that Tokugawa has mustered.
A truly worthy opponent.
It's time to give our lives... now!
If we let them go back to Sasshuu alive,
it would be a shame on the Ii Clan of Tokugawa.
Lord!
Stall for time! Hold up the enemy as long as possible.
Hold back as many as we can!
I'll be waiting for you, Toyohisa! I'll be waiting in Satsuma!
I'll be waiting! You are not allowed to die, Toyohisa!
I'm a lucky guy, to have an old man like him.
Well, now! It's time to do a warrior's work.
Let's do it!
Take aim!
Fire!
Fear not! Run them down!
Wow! That was splendid!
I am Toyohisa of the Shimazu Clan, undersecretary
to the Imperial Minister of the Center!
You're dead!
I am Naomasa of the Ii Clan, undersecretary to the Ministry of War!
Don't you know you've been defeated?!
I shall have your head.
Heh... what are you talking about, you old fool?!
My head won't be yours...
Yours will be mine!
Stupid fool!
Commander Naomasa!
Defend our lord!
Ready!
T-This man!
Damn idiot!
You are the idiot, Naomasa, the Chamberlain of the Ii Clan!
I've got you!
Lord?!
-My lord! -My lord!
My lord!
Lord Naomasa!
Withdraw! Withdraw now!
Withdraw!
Wait!
Wait, Naomasa!
Don't mess with me, you moron!
Leave your head here!
Leave your head with me! Naomasa!
I'm going home...
Out for lunch Be back in a while
Please take a number
Battle of Sekigahara is over
Shimazu Toyohisa
Out for lunch Be back in a while
Next.
What the hell?!
Where is this?! Where am I?!
Who are you?!
Damn you...! I am going back...
Shimazu Toyohisa
Next.
What the hell?!
What is that?!
What happened to it, brother? Did it die?
What the hell?! It's covered with blood.
Hey you! What's wrong?
Are you alright?
Hey you. Are you okay?!
This man is earless, brother.
Devils. I must've been sent to hell after all...
Hey, you!
This isn't an ordinary dying man.
This language...
It's a Drifter.
What?! Again?!
Wh-What should we do?
What else can we do?
We have to take him to that deserted castle.
It's sooo heavy!
Drag drag drag... Drip drip
It must weigh a ton.
We have to hurry up.
If the lord ever finds out about this, we'll be damned...
Stop!
If you get any closer to the castle, I'll kill you!
Also, if you scream, I'll kill you!
What do you want?!
This thing is one of you, right?
It's dying!
It took a lot for us to bring it to you!
Slow down. I don't understand. And speak up.
If you don't speak slower, I'll kill you.
Isn't this a Drifter like you? Look at it!
Look!
Leave it there.
I still don't understand them at all.
That's enough. Let's get out of here.
We'll get killed if they find out we not only entered the forest,
but also met with a Drifter...
We need to hurry and get back.
This man is a warrior. Could he be from the Land of the Rising Sun?
Who is he?
What happened?
The villagers brought a dying man. He is from the Land of the Rising Sun.
He is a warrior of some clan.
Is he still alive?
He is barely breathing, but he's still alive.
I see.
We don't have proper medication, but tend to his wounds.
His strength and fate may keep him alive...
How intriguing life is...
Toyohisa! Toyohisa!
This was your first battle, yet you've brought back an enemy's head.
Good job! What a fine boy!
-Father! -Toyohisa!
Father! Father!
Oh, you're up.
You're resilient.
You've just been stitched up. You'll die if you move around too much.
Who the hell are you?!
You're asking me who I am? Who are you?
Answer me! Who are you and where are you from?
The Mokkou Crest...
Are you a member of the Oda Clan?
A member?! Don't be so stupid.
Who the hell are you?!
I am Nobunaga... the former Minister of the Right of the Oda Clan.
That was dangerous, you stupid fool.
You are the fool. You call yourself Nobunaga?!
Lord Nobunaga has been dead for a long time.
That means this must be the next world
and you are impersonating Nobunaga...
Please stop.
You're awake.
Excellent.
Quack quack quack
Could you please pluck feathers?
Huh? Sure...
Time on your hands?
Huh? Yeah...
Please pluck.
Pluck pluck pluck
What the hell?!
You said Nobunaga had died.
People really do think I died then, huh?
Yeah! He died!
He was betrayed and killed by Akechi's forces at Honnouji Temple in Kyoto.
That was a full eighteen years ago!
What?!
Don't be stupid! Eighteen years?!
It hasn't been even a half year since the baldy assaulted Honnouji
and I was thrown into this world!
That's why I've been telling you...
You are either a devil from hell or a ghost.
If not, you are just a madman.
I can't help laughing, seeing you two making a big fuss...
Who are you?
Tell him. Tell him.
My name is Yoichi.
Nasu Suketaka Yoichi
Nasu Suketaka Yoichi.
You're lying!
Rumble rumble rumble You are from the time of the Genpei War.
Rumble rumble rumble
That was over 400 years ago! That's too absurd!
Whether you believe it absurd or not, I am who I am.
I must be dreaming! Without a doubt, this is a dream!
Well, who are you and where are you from?
I am Shimazu
Toyohisa of the Shimazu Clan! I am the son of Shimazu Iehisa.
Shimazu?
Who?
Shimazu Big City
Where? Where? Where? Where? Where?
I see! It's in the far edge of Kyushu... A super hick town!
Oho.
I'll kill you!
I know that clan. A Lord Shimazu lived in my time as well.
If my memory is correct, he was from somewhere in the countryside of Kyushu.
I see. Your family must have been provincial for generations.
I'll kill you all!
If you move around too much, you'll die.
For I've just stitched up your wounds.
You are a resilient man.
Sit down.
You called yourself Nobunaga, didn't you?
Yeah.
Didn't you die at the Honnouji Temple? You're supposed to be dead!
As if I would allow myself to be killed by that baldy.
I took Ranmaru with me and ran around, trying to escape the temple.
No way in hell you'll kill me, you old fool!
I'm used to betrayals like yours!
Then, I found myself in an unfamiliar place.
There, I saw a strange stone passage filled with countless doors.
In the middle of the passage was a mysterious man.
Same here. I met him, too.
I also met the man...
Sekigahara?
Is it in Mino?
Yeah. It was a great battle between Tokugawa's forces and Ishida's forces.
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
Ishida, as in that little toady?!
Why on earth did Tokugawa have to fight such a battle?
Because, after the death of the regent,
the country slid back into civil war.
Regent?! Why the hell was the regent running the state?!
Because the regent gained control of the whole country!
Regent Hideyoshi!
Wait! What?
Tell me how the hell that bald rat took over the country!
That's enough! Don't you get it?!
Hideyoshi's the one who defeated Akechi, destroyed Shibata,
then conquered the country!
D-Did Katsuie die?! How about Oichi?!
-Don't know! -Niwa?!
Kazumasu?!
Toshiie?!
They're nobodies!
The Oda are now just minions of Ieyasu.
Nobody remembers the clan's sovereignty!
What the hell?!
How about Nobutada?
Tell me what happened to my son.
He died! His Nijou Palace was attacked by Mitsuhide.
He thought you were dead...
He fought to the bitter end!
My son was stupid!
Idiot... Idiot...
He should have gotten out of there as soon as possible.
The fifty years of human life...
Everything I did for those fifty years of my life was in vain.
The world is uncertain.
I was also surprised to hear
from Lord Nobunaga that the Minamoto Clan was overthrown,
and the Kamakura Shogunate was destroyed as well.
You told me you were Nobunaga, so...
When I saw this man, I thought he was the famous Mori Ranmaru.
I wish that would've been true.
I wonder what they are talking about.
From this far distance, it's really...
Semu, respond to me.
How's it going? Did you catch it?
Yes, sir. They are certainly Drifters.
Three of them are gathered.
It's unbelievable.
Octobrist
We've got to do something about them.
Otherwise...
Smell of Battle
Elven Village under Siege
Good!
