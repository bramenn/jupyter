Momozono Nanami, 17 years old
As long as I have my 10,000 horse power, I don't care about debt.
Hey! What about food?!
You're freakin' deadbeat dad!
More bad luck...
You are being evicted from your apartment.
Please leave. o
Huh?!
Huh?!!
Where's my dad?
Farewell Letter (back)
Huh?!
I'm going on a trip. Please don't look for me. -Dad
I'm going on a trip. Please don't look for me. -Dad
Damn my

A demon temple?!

PRESENTS
High school student Momozono Nanami is the heroine of our story.
She used to be quite lively and beautiful.
However, right now, she is weary.
Given that her father is addicted to gambling,
and he has ruined the family's finances,
it's understandable that she's like this.
She can't even eat the same kind of food her friends eat for lunch.
On top of all that, she was evicted.
What?!
Where's my dad?
Huh?!
Her dad had already moved out and ran off somewhere.
And so, our pitiful Nanami was thrown out onto the streets.
What's in store for her now?
By the way, this show isn't a tragedy. It's a romantic comedy.
May you find good fortune.
Damn my deadbeat dad!
Someone...
Someone help me!
Get that dog away!
Shoo! Shoo!
Thanks for saving me!
I thought I'd come back after all these years...
When I got here, a dog started chasing me!
Are you not good with dogs?
Quite.
Do you live in this town?
Y-Yes,
but I lost my home.
So, she explained her situation.
What?
Your father left you his debts?
You must hate him for running away.
Yeah...
Unfortunately, I left my home too.
Huh?
It's been decades.
I wonder what everybody's doing now.
Tomoe will probably knock my teeth out if I show my face.
Tomoe?
Is she his wife?
But, you have a home to go back to, right?
Huh?
I mean, look at me, I don't even have that much!
You can have mine, then.
Huh?
The house can't be left empty for too long.
If you're willing to move in, that'd be a load off my shoulders.
Besides, I think it's a better fit for you.
Please go to the address on this paper.
Just say that Mikage sent you.
E-Excuse me...
New master?
I don't have anywhere else to go anyway.
It's probably a prank, but I might as well go.
It was a prank.
I'll never trust another adult again!
Mikage-sama!
Huh? What was that?
Mikage-sama.
A ghost!
Is that you, Mikage?
Where have you been all this time?
You made me watch over the house for 20 years.
I'm gonna freakin' kill you!
Hey, this ain't Mikage.
No way!
Tomoe-dono, look!
She has the Earth Deity's seal on her forehead.
Her spirit feels like Mikage-sama's too.
But she's not Mikage.
Hey, girl.
Who are you?
I walked into a demon temple!
Tomoe-dono.
Well, this bad handwriting is his all right.
A man told me to come here since I didn't have anywhere to stay.
He's Tomoe?
He looks like a model...
The man you met was the local Earth Deity.
The fact that he has given you ownership of this temple means...
that you've inherited his role as the Earth Deity.
Huh?
Oh, what a joyous day!
The Earth Deity has returned!
We must prepare a feast immediately.
Please enjoy this meal, Earth Deity.
Eat, eat!
Hold it!
What? What?
I'm the Earth Deity?
Like, a goddess?
But I'm Momozono Nanami, a high-schooler, a human being!
When did I became a deity?
The exact moment you received this seal on your forehead!
The seal on my forehead?
That kiss...
That was a seal?
This kid is supposed to be a deity?
What can a filthy girl like you do?!
Collect offerings or, at best, weed the garden, right?
I refuse to accept her!
But she has Mikage-sama's blessing!
I don't need her!
Get her out of here.
Wait!
You're being really rude, you know that?
Actually, who the heck would want to make an offering at a rundown temple like this?
I refuse to stay in this temple.
Don't say that, Nanami-sama!
No! No! No!
Either she goes, or I go.
Tomoe-dono.
I only serve Mikage.
I have no intention of serving her.
You can just replace me with any old stray dog.
Hey, wait!
What?
Well...
For now, could you let me stay the night?
With pleasure!
Man, what a dream!
My father ran away, I got evicted from my house...
Then I got lost, and some guy gave me his house.
When I went, it turned out to be a rundown temple.
And then they kept saying I was the Earth Deity.
I was like, What?
Then a really rude demon named Tomoe said that he wouldn't accept it.
What a dream!
Good morning, Earth Deity!
Without further ado, there are some things we'd like you to do.
Which are?
The duties of the Earth Deity!
First, sweep the yard.
Clean the dirt off of the walls.
Rake the leaves into a neat pile!
Next, wipe the floor.
After this comes weeding!
This is a god's job?
Excuse me, but I never said I'd be the Earth Deity.
W-What are you saying?
There is no one besides you to protect this temple now that Tomoe-dono is gone!
We, Onikiri and Koutetsu, have served this temple for many years.
And we shall serve you too, Nanami-sama!
Order us as you like!
By the way...
Yes?
Who is Tomoe, anyway?
He is a prophet that served Mikage-sama.
Profit?
No, like a divine servant.
He used to be a fox demon.
He was chosen in place of the Dog Deity.
Since Mikage-sama hates dogs.
I knew that last part.
I guess I can think of it as earning my keep.
Ouch!
You can't even pull weeds properly.
Wow, you're useless.
What?
I thought you left.
I don't think you have what it takes to be an Earth Deity.
Why don't you run home before it's too late?
I don't have a home to go back to.
Hmm?
They kicked me out because of my dad's debts.
Who cares?
What was the point?
Ugh, I'm beat!
They said I'm supposed to be a god or something, but it feels like they're just using me.
Please,
Huh?
watch over my daughter when she gives birth.
I heard a voice.
Was that her voice?
Indeed!
That was the prayer of a believer.
It's the job of the Earth Deity to hear the prayers of people who make offerings.
Yes, this is your next job!
Please read all of these.
What are these?
The list of prayers from the last 20 years.
Twenty years?!
Tomoe-dono wrote them down,
so Mikage-sama could look through them upon his return.
In his absence, the number of believers has dwindled.
But thanks to Tomoe-dono, who looked after the temple,
there are still believers who often make offerings, like the old lady just now.
What you did today, was what Tomoe-dono has been doing this whole time.
No wonder.
His handwriting is so neat...
Everything is so detailed.
Please!
Please, hear my prayers.
Actually, who the heck would want to make an offering at a rundown temple like this?
Do you understand now, Nanami-sama?
Yeah, I understand.
I understand that I'm not cut out to be a deity.
Huh?!
Huh?!
I'm just a girl in high school with no powers.
But...
But?
I want to set things straight.
It seems that I misunderstood him.
I want you two to take me to him.
But...
He's probably in the other world right now.
The other world?
The other world,
located in the depths of the shadowy jungle,
is guarded by total darkness at its entrance.
A world residing between ours and the underworld
where demons roam freely.
Adjoining our world, it harbors darkness so black that a single peek will make you lose your way.
This is...
Tomoe-dono!
Tomoe-dono, where are you?
You're too loud, Onikiri, Koutetsu.
Tomoe-dono, so this is where you were.
Do you have any business with me?
Tomoe-dono.
Tomoe-dono, how pitiful!
You're a divine messenger, yet you've stooped to drinking while the sun is still high!
Leave me alone.
Tomoe-dono, change your clothes immediately!
You two, get out!
I can't believe these two!
You two the ones who should leave!
I agree.
Return to the temple.
Tomoe-dono, you still won't accept her as your master?
Are you fine with the temple collapsing?
I don't care if the temple crumbles.
I don't care anymore. In fact, I'm relieved that I don't have to to be a divine messenger anymore!
I'm going to do whatever I want from now on.
Tomoe-dono,
Nanami-sama said that she wanted to talk to you.
So she's here now.
What?!
You have a home to go back to, and that's how you treat the temple?
Doesn't it mean anything to you?!
Goodbye!
Huh! Nanami-sama!
Why did you bring her here?
She insisted...
Who the hell brings normal humans here?!
She's not just a human, she's our Earth Deity.
That's even worse.
What's with him?
He's all bark and no bite!
I don't care if the temple crumbles.
I can't believe he'd say something like that!
Girl, are you the human who's the new Earth Deity at Mikage's shrine?
We'd heard that Mikage gave up being the Earth Deity, but we never thought...
Screw it!
Let's gobble her while she's fresh!
No!
Nanami-sama!
Wait up!
Oh, it's Tomoe.
Can we eat that girl?
I hope you're not here to stop us.
You can just eat her.
You don't need my permission.
Are you sure?
Thank you!
But you caught me in a bad mood.
A powerless girl entrusted with the powers of a land god...
If I had to compare her to something, she's like a duck given leeks and a pot and told to cook itself.
Though, it's not my business anymore.
This should be far enough.
At least, we think it is.
Nanami-sama, please go back to Tomoe-dono.
Huh?
We need him to become your divine messenger, no matter what.
No, I'm good. I don't need him.
I'm going home now.
But, Nanami-sama!
If you get him to make a contract,
he has to obey your every word.
Huh?
Obey my every word?
Is that true?
Yes, it's one of the special powers of the Earth Deity.
Oh? This is interesting.
And how should I go about making this contract?
About that,
all you have to do
is kiss him!
If you can manage that, he'll be your loyal servant.
He will do anything you ask him.
Huh? Nanami-sama?
They're trouble in disguise!
Nanami-sama!
What are those two trying to make me to do?
I'm going home.
I'm going straight home.
They're unbelievable!
Wait, Miss,
Huh?
could you give me a hand here?
Huh?
Nanami-sama, where are you?
I'd stumbled on that tree's root.
Where do you live?
Nanami-sama!
Nanami-sama!
Granny, is your house this way?
You're headed in the right direction.
Nanami-sama!
Are you hurt?
She's coming!
She's the demon hag!
Let's get out of here, Nanami-sama!
I won't let you escape!
Let me eat you!
Eating an Earth Deity is worth a thousand years of life!
Koutetsu actually tastes bad.
It's not her!
Where is the girl?
Tomoe-dono!
Koutetsu has called for Tomoe-dono.
When he comes, you should form the contract with him.
No way!
No way in hell!
Then, please take this.
What's that?
A warding talisman.
Warding talisman?
It's another one of your powers as an Earth Deity.
If you write something and point it at your foes,
the word takes form, becoming what you wrote.
Really?
Turn into a giant guardian deity!
Um, Nanami-sama, the charm can't be more powerful than you.
You should've said that in the first place!
I only have two more!
Bon appetit!
You little brat!
Only one left!
Did she get eaten yet?
Tomoe-dono, please save Nanami-sama!
Not yet, I see.
Tomoe, save me!
Maybe I should see what she looks like when she's crying.
This is too high!
Nanami-sama, hurry up!
I found you, little girl!
She's closing in on us!
Nanami-sama!
Looks like you're in a bind, Nanami.
Nanami-sama! Nanami-sama!
Once I heard that you were in trouble, I flew right over...
Tomoe!
Wha?
Let me go!
Do you want me to save you?
You want my help, right?
If you cry and beg, and admit that you were a fool, I might consider helping you.
W-Who'd want help from you?
Nanami-sama,
repeat after me, I was a fool!
I don't wanna!
Ask for his forgiveness.
I don't wanna!
Tomoe-sama, please!
I said no!
He'll help you if you say just one of them.
Right, Tomoe-dono?
Oh, yeah.
As long as you say one, I'll help you.
Now, go.
Nanami-sama, say it!
I don't wanna!
Nanami-sama, say it!
I don't wanna!
Nanami-sama!
I won't say it.
I'd rather do this than grovel at the feet of someone like him!
You idiot!
You could've just said it, you know?
Are you going to let your stubbornness get you killed?
Unite, and forthwith ye shall...
Tomoe, save me!
Crap!
Nanami-sama, you're a bona fide deity of the land now!
What have you done to my prey?
Come down, you damn hag.
Thanks to you, I'm a divine servant again!
How long did I wait for my freedom? What do you have to say for yourself?
Why you... you...
I'm just a frail, old lady! What are you doing?!
Frail?
You think you're funny?
He doesn't look very heroic right now.
Tomoe...
What?
Thanks for... saving me.
Let's go back to the temple, Tomoe!
A certain celebrity transferred into Nanami's high school.
All the girls are going wild for him.
But he has a certain supernatural air about him.
Next Time: The Targeted Goddess.
Someone's after her, eh?
