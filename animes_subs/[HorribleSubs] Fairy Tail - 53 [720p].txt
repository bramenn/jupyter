The Dark Guild with only 6 members, Oracion Seis!
In order to put them down, the official guilds have formed an alliance!
Men...
Lyon and Sherry?!
And even Ichiya, who I can't handle!
Handsome... men!
If it's love and dreams and you it'll become magical.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
I kind of admired this powerful world,
chock-full of problems.
Frozen time has started to move again
ever since I met you.
Why were we born? Why do we live?
I don't need any complicated answers.
Laugh! Cry! Be honest with yourself.
Simple feelings are the most important.
You can change those tears shed on sad nights into strength.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
Wait...
How crazy dangerous is this guy?
Owwy...
I'm Wendy Marvel, from Caitshelter.
It's nice to meet you all.
A girl?
A child?
A little kiddie...?
What a surprise... This little girl is...
Wendy...
And now, all four guilds have gathered.
You're just going to continue on?
But seriously...
Sending this one little girl for such a big mission?
What is Caitshelter thinking?
Oh?
She's not alone, Miss Too-Much-Makeup.
Oracion Seis Appears!
A cat?
Looks like it.
The same as Happy!
It talks!
Too much makeup? How cruel!
That's her problem?
Charles, you came with me?
Of course! I'd be far too worried with you going alone.
A cat?
Delayed reaction?!
Hey, Lucy... Would you give her this fish of mine?
Wait, is this love at first sight?
Now, now... You have to make your move yourself or it won't work.
You lllike her!
You're mimicking me!
And you're rolling your tongue 3 times more!
U-Um...
I can't fight at all...
But I can use a lot of magic that can help support you.
So... So please don't leave me out!
It's because you're always so weak-kneed that people look down on you!
I-I'm sorry...
I'm saying not to apologize so quickly!
I'm sorry!
I apologize. I was a bit taken aback at first, but it wasn't my intention.
I'm glad to have you with us, Wendy.
It's Erza-san! It's really her, Charles!
She's a better woman than I thought she'd be.
Hey... Have you heard of me?
I'm Happy, the Necomander!
She's all nervous! How cute!
Looks more like she blew you off, but whatever.
You're useless, Lucy. You can't understand a woman's heart.
Uh... I do happen to be a woman, though...
Whatever.
That girl is going to grow into a real babe.
I think she's plenty cute already.
Come this way, little Miss.
Um...
Jumpin' the gun?!
How could I describe this girl's parfum?
It's not something you smell every day.
Have you noticed, Ichiya-dono? Her magical power is something different than ours.
It looks like Erza-dono has also noticed.
Impressive, as usual.
Um...
Would you like some orange juice?
Seriously, you're just too cute.
Please, have a hot towel.
Um... Uh...
What is with these men in heat?
What's the matter, Natsu?
Wendy... I know I've heard that name before, I think...
You know the girl?
Can you remember for me?
Hell no!
So, who was it again?
Give me a break here.
You shouldn't go smiling to random guys like that.
T-That's not what I was...
What kind of guys do you like?
Won't you have some cake?
I mean, seriously, you're too damn cute.
I said, we didn't come here to play around!
Clean this up at once!
Right away, Master!
Men...
They changed what they call him again...
You almost have to admire their inconsistency...
Now then! As it seems we are all here, I will go ahead and explain the plan.
Is that pose of yours really necessary?
I will start with the place where the Six Wizard Generals, Oracion Seis, are gathering...
But first, I will inspect the bathroom's parfum.
Hey, don't go smelling up the toilet!
Excellent, Sensei!
They changed again!
The Worth Woodsea spreads out from here to the north.
Ancient people sealed an extremely power magic spell inside the woodsea.
Its name is... Nirvana!
Look, we really don't need the posing.
Nirvana?
I have never heard of it.
What about you, Jura-san?
No. I know not of it.
Have you heard of Nirvana? And do you want a fish?
No, thank you.
It's destruction magic powerful enough for the ancients to seal.
That's basically all we know.
We don't know what kind of magic it is.
Destruction magic?
I don't like the sound of that...
The reason that Oracion Seis has gathered in the woodsea
must be to get their hands on Nirvana.
And in order for us to stop them...
And there they go posing again...
I'm not even going to say anything anymore.
We have 12 on our side. They have 6.
But we can't underestimate them.
Those six are all incredibly powerful.
Archive? That's a rare magic.
I've never seen it before.
These are videos of them we finally obtained recently.
The wizard who uses poisonous snakes... Cobra.
Ooh, he looks like a real bad guy!
Look at those slanted eyes!
You're eyes are the same!
Thought to use speed magic, like his name implies... Racer.
I think this is a case of hate at first sight.
I agree.
He's a wizard that can even wipe out an entire military unit, and will if there's profit in it...
Hot Eye of the Heavenly Eye!
For profit?
Despicable.
The woman said to peer into your heart... Angel.
I think I might be naturally weak against someone like that.
We don't have much information about this guy, but he's called Midnight.
Midnight?
That name doesn't bode well.
Then, the control center for them all... Brain.
Each of them holds magical power great enough to destroy an entire guild.
That's why we'll use our numbers to our advantage.
Um... I think it might be best if you didn't count me...
I'm also not very good at fighting!
Wendy! Stop being so weak!
Hey, what should we do? They aren't counting us!
Do not worry! Our plan does not simply involve fighting.
All we have to do is find their base of operations.
Their base?
Ah, yes... We haven't mentioned it yet.
We conjecture that they have a temporary base somewhere in the woodsea.
If it's possible, I'd want us to get them all into their base.
But how?
By whacking'em, duh!
So that means fighting, of course.
What will we do when they're all there?
We will use our guild's pride and joy, Christina, the Pegasus,
and together with it, wipe the base off the face of the planet!
So it's like a magical bomber?
We'd use that kind of thing against people?
That's just how powerful they are!
Right!
Are you ready?
If we get in battle, do not fight alone under any circumstances!
Make sure to have at least two of us for every one of them we face!
Right...
This is so dangerous!
This is a problem!
Please stop sounding so pitiful!
Okay! I'm all fired up!
I'll take all six of'em on at once!
Wait! Natsu!
Honestly, I can't believe him...
I know he's impatient, but seriously...
I don't think he even listened to the plan.
Because he is Natsu!
Come on now...
How awful...
At least open the door!
We have no choice... Let's go!
Man, that idiot!
Hurry!
Right!
We can't let Fairy Tail get all the good bits.
Let's go, Sherry!
Right!
Lyon! Sherry!
We're going too!
Yeah!
Angel, huh?
Come on, hang in there!
Don't worry!
I'm with you!
Wendy, let's go.
Why?! Don't leave me behind!
My, my...
Men...
Well, it looks like the operation has started.
We should also get going.
Before that, Jura-san...
I have heard that you are one of the Ten Great Wizard Saints...
Indeed I am.
And you are powerful enough to rival even Master Makarov?
Oh, not even close.
The title of Wizard Saint is bestowed by the Council. I'm the weakest of them all.
We may have the same title, but compared to Master Makarov,
it's like the difference between Heaven and Earth.
Oh.
That's quite a relief to hear.
If you were really as powerful as Makarov, I would have been somewhat at a loss.
What is this smell?
A magical parfum that saps one's fighting spirit.
Ichiya-dono... What is the meaning of this?
And furthermore, this is a scent that simulates every sensation of pain
throughout your entire body...
I mean, parfum, that is!
We're back!
That Ichiya fellow only ever thought about pervy stuff.
Seriously! What a worthless adult.
Now, now... No complaining.
What... in the world is...
Oh, I just copied that dirty little man.
And thanks to that, I know your entire plan!
We can tell what the people...
Righto! I've gotten rid of two already.
Men...
What a pity...
Don't get in our way, children of the light.
Naughty children who get in our way will face Angel's judgment.
I can see the woodsea!
Wait, Natsu!
Not a chance!
Fool! Don't go running off ahead of us!
What? Can't stand the thought of me taking the lead?
What?! How dare you, you little...
Damn, look at him fall.
Hasty idiot.
He hasn't changed much, has he?
When I think that I once fought with him, it's really quite complicated.
That's love, yet again!
Uh, no, it isn't.
Wait! You all run too fast!
Whatever happened to ladies first?
Should I give you a princess carry?
I'll hold your hand!
Stay by my side.
Shut up!
Wendy, stop dilly-dallying!
But...
I'm doing my best, too!
Oww...
Anyway, this place smells weird.
Have you noticed?
Yeah. I don't really get it, but there's something odd in the air.
Don't let your guard down, Sherry!
Right!
What took you so long, people?
You must have a durable body to go along with that thick skull of yours...
What the hell are you doing?
Don't just stop like that!
Look!
Lyon-sama!
Yes...
The magical bomber, Christina!
Whoa!
That's the Pegasus I've heard about?
Wow...
It sure is big...
That gives me some hope.
Okay! Let's split up and search for their base.
What are you talking about?
You're useless...
What happened to Christina?
Oh, no...
What happened?
Hey...
Yeah...
Somebody's coming! Watch out!
Wendy!
They're...
The maggots have swarmed...
We saw through your plans.
We already got Jura and Ichiya!
How do you like that?
What?!
Impossible!
You're trembling... I can hear it.
We should hurry up with our work.
But you are getting in our way.
Money makes people stronger, yes!
Let me tell you something nice.
Money is everything in this world, and...
Hot Eye, shut up!
I think one of them is asleep...
I didn't expect them to show themselves to us.
Hey...
Yeah.
I can hear you...
Now we don't have to go find you!
Do it.
Okay.
Motor!
Natsu, Gray!
Idiot!
What the... Why am I...
Sherry!
Right!
I saw that, yes!
Even without love, as long as you have money, yes!
What is this? The ground is...
Love is more important!
Lyon-sama!
I'll take Angel!
No fair!
I'll take the brains!
Ren!
Eve, Ren!
So fast...
He's so fast, I can't see!
Fast is good.
Requip!
I can hear you.
Forward, my blades!
What?
He read and dodged that many swords?
Damn it...
You! Why are you sleeping, you bastard?!
Requip!
Soaring Armor!
Ooh, you're quick!
Fast is good!
But I can hear it, Titania...
Your next move, that is!
I knew it, he's predicting me...
Predicting? No...
I told you, I can hear you.
Wake up, you!
What was that just now?
My magic didn't hit?
Stop it.
Midnight's real scary when he wakes up.
Ice Make...
Lance!
Ice Make...
Doll Attack...
Eagle!
Mud Doll!
Money is more powerful than love, yes!
So this is Erza Scarlet?
I can hear your movements...
Your breathing...
The contraction and expansion of your muscles...
Your very thoughts, even...
I see... You're also...
You're open!
I saw it, yes!
Cobra, what are you waiting for?
Cubelios!
Cubelios's poison doesn't take effect immediately.
It lets you live for a while in pain!
Trash, you should all vanish from this earth.
What is that magical power?
The atmosphere is trembling!
This is bad...
Dark Rondo!
What's the matter, Brain?
Why did you stop the spell?
Wendy!
Oracion Seis is just too powerful, wiping us all out like that!
I ain't been wiped out yet.
You were the first one!
I ain't lost'till I say I lost!
It's time to get my revenge!
If it follows your usual revenge pattern, you'll be beaten to a pulp!
Next time: Sky Maiden.
And when have I ever been beaten to a pulp by the same guy twice?
What? You don't remember?
Don't look back, I always say!
In your case, that's not really a good thing...
