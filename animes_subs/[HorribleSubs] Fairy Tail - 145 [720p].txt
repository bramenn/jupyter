You've noticed, have you?!
Butts?!
Wrong! The Jiggle Butt Gang!
What do you guys want?!
Hey, come on, do you know where we are?!
What is this?!
Jail! We're in a jail!
What are you in for, laddy?
What am I...?
That's right! Lucy!
Where's Lucy?!
Hell if I know! You were the only one here when they tossed us in.
It was just me?!
Where's Lucy?!
Are you okay?!
Dammit! What was that?!
A magic barrier, I reckon.
Barrier...?
You can't use magic in this cage,
and if you try damaging it with excessive force, you'll be knocked on your butt like you just were.
Once you're locked up in here, it's like it's all over.
Don't make me laugh!
Roar of the Fire Dragon... Huh?!
Real Nightmare!
Make a fool outta me...
One more time!
Roar of the...
That'll do for a while!
That'll do!
That'll do it for now!
What the hell?! Let go of me!
Cool it!
Meeting you here is surely a sign from the god of evil, laddy!
Let's put our heads together and think up a way to escape from here!
You're right...
It is lucky that we met here.
Right?!
You and us are comrades!
And since we're comrades...
It's lame, so no thanks.
L-Lame?!
Hey, more importantly, why are you guys in here?
We're here'cause evil guys like us don't know when to quit.
To be precise, where there's treasure, there's evil!
It seems like the treasure you people are looking for is that clock, right?
Looks like it has some connection to this cathedral!
Huh. You did your homework.
Evil guys are plugged into a network of evil.
And so,
we snuck into this place!
And then we heard something terrible!
Something terrible?
Your Holiness, about the archbishop's madness...
Perhaps we can no longer keep it hidden.
The pilgrims outside the gate...
It seems they don't know yet.
Good then.
All we need do is keep the archbishop out of sight until the anniversary event begins.
If there are those who spread negative rumors, the Cleaner only need be sent to eliminate them.
E-Eliminate?!
That means kill!
We thought that was big trouble, and tried to escape right away, but ended up here.
The only silver lining is they don't know what we overheard.
But! If they do find out what we heard, I bet we'll never get out of here!
We may never get out...
We'll see...
Hey! I thought evil doesn't give up!
Yeah, sure, but what are we gonna do when magic won't even work here?!
I'm breakin' outta here!
Whatever happens, I gotta save Lucy.
And besides, there's a guy whose ass I wanna kick!
Break out?!
That sounds so evil!
That's a new evil milestone in the annals of Jiggle Butt Gang history!
That's right! If you guys wanna be saved too, you better cooperate with me!
Alright! Leave the strategy to us!
Lackeys, assemble!
Right!
What the hell is goin' on here?!
Then it's true that Michelle is the sixth member of Oracion Seis?
Yeah. She fooled us.
I can't believe it...
Natsu, Lucy, and the others have been captured.
Dammit!
It was all I could do just to get away myself.
You can't blame yourself.
It's not all your fault.
Cana. What do you want to say?
My cards didn't foretell that Brain II would show up at Kardia Cathedral.
And they didn't give me accurate pairings either for splitting into teams.
Everyone was out of step with each other, right?
Now that you mention it...
We didn't mesh with each other.
You mean someone or something was using your divinations?
Most likely.
Jeez. This whole thing is frustrating.
Everyone, now isn't the time to review our mistakes!
It's more important to save Natsu-san and Lucy-san, then do something about this situation!
Yeah, Wendy's right!
Excuse me, young lady...
It's the Actually people!
Who might you folks be?
Actually, we belong to the Archaeological Society.
Actually, we would like to meet with Lucy Heartfilia-sama, actually.
What's going on? It's noisy out there...
What business do you have with Lucy?
And who are you?
I'm the master here, Macao.
I would know your purpose in coming here.
Actually...
We need to speak with Lucy-sama directly.
Quite so! It has to do with that sky.
Lucy and Natsu were both captured by Oracion Seis.
What?!
Would you tell us?
We would like to hear even a little information.
Now, with circumstances continually changing,
I suppose there's no longer any reason to hide it, actually.
Everyone, you know of Will Neville, yes?
Actually, I am Jean-Luc Neville, Will's great-grandson.
This is unexpected...
Actually, I was on good terms with Lucy-sama's father, Jude Heartfilia-sama.
Lucy's dad... This story is starting to come together somehow...
Actually, I have devoted my life to seeing that the Infinity Clock stays sealed away.
Are you a Celestial Spirit Wizard?
No. As someone who has inherited the Neville name,
I just know the history of the Infinity Clock.
My purpose is to give the warning if there is a threat of chaos
spreading throughout the world and to take precautions against it.
Actually, it happened several months ago...
At the excavation site of certain ruins, a hand of the Infinity Clock was discovered.
The ruins were there to keep magic sealed away.
Actually, the Archaeological Society received word from the expedition,
but by the time we got there, it was too late.
Somehow, it had actually had fallen into Jude's hands.
Actually, the clock hand possesses an extremely high level of magic
that is easy to track down.
If it had fallen into the wrong hands, it's very likely that chaos would be summoned.
I was anxious, but when I found out at last that Jude-sama had it, I got in touch with him.
In order to seal away the magic that it was emitting, I wrapped it in a magic cloth.
Then, Jude-sama searched for another safe place to seal it away.
He made me that promise, actually.
So my guess is that Lucy's father meant to entrust that to her...
How dangerous is the Infinity Clock?
It's powerful magic that activates the endless nightmare... Real Nightmare.
Real Nightmare?
Actually, it controls the sense of time that humans possess,
thereby controlling time itself!
It's a bit difficult to explain,
but it doesn't actually manipulate time.
It's all a matter of the human sense...
Do you understand?
Don't ask me!
The control of time is what's meant by chaos will descend.
And that'll bring about the end of the world?
I'm finding it hard to picture that.
Think about it. Right now is when, actually?
What are you actually doing right now?
Who is actually standing in front of you?
You'll lose the ability to comprehend every last bit of your own mind.
A person's memories and consciousness are actually an accumulation of all of his or her experiences up to now.
If the connection between all those times are manipulated, actually...
That's some serious stuff.
Chaos doesn't even begin to describe it.
The Infinity Clock is in the sky over Zentopia Cathedral.
I'm told that the roots of the religion's liturgy comes from that.
It's said that the people who survived the chaos of the clock long ago
are the ones who actually founded Zentopia.
They sealed away the terror and have warned of it all along, actually.
For a long time, its existence was actually hidden from Zentopia's history,
but once every 100 years, the magic it accumulated was released,
often making it the target of evildoers.
I'm begging you. Please take this job, Fairy Tail.
Please stop it... Stop the Infinity Clock!
We don't need to be asked, right?
Nope.
Yeah! We have to save Natsu and Lucy, too!
Alright. We'll accept this job.
Fairy Tail will take care of this!
Congratulations on the restoration of the Infinity Castle, Brain II!
It's been tough on you, huh, Klodoa?
No, no. All I did was follow Master Zero's orders, yeah.
That being said, we've progressed this far because of Master Zero's favorite thing, your skill.
I'm impressed as always!
And on top of that, this smart alec brat!
It's also impressive how Imitatia-sama used her.
Michelle... Tell me... Why...?
Say something!
My name is Imitatia, not Michelle.
Stop making me tell you that.
We have a Celestial Spirit Wizard.
The endless nightmare will begin...
You know that to seal the Infinity Clock,
Celestial Spirit Wizards were actually utilizing a biological link, yes?
We heard something like that.
The new Oracion Seis was cutting that link, right?
Actually, if the link is severed,
it seems the Celestial Spirit Wizard is cursed with 100 years of sleep
and goes into a chrysalis-like state.
Chrysalis?
What the hell is that?!
The biological link takes powerful magic to work,
so if it's severed by the Anti-Link,
the advance of time on the body and mind becomes extremely slow as a reaction.
Then the person sleeps for 100 years.
It's a sort of sacrifice so that we'll be able to control the Infinity Clock.
That's just like treating people as tools!
So what?
You've already slept once for seven years.
That's nothing compared to 100 years!
But even just seven years, I'll never forget how confusing and painful it was coming home.
Even though time had passed for everyone else, we didn't spend any of it with them.
Can you understand that feeling?
It made me think how cruel it is to lose time.
But still, we had friends who accepted us.
Did those Celestial Spirit Wizards have that same kind of support?
They don't, which is exactly why it can be called a curse.
You'll be cursed the same way.
Michelle, I was really happy when I met you.
I'm doing this for your sake, Nee-san.
You're saying this is for my sake?! Lying to me?! Getting close to me?!
It wasn't all a lie.
What about my father?
What about you calling me Nee-san?
That's...
Okay, okay. Let's can the chatter.
Brain, let's get started.
Good idea, Imitatia.
Lucy Heartfilia, very shortly, it will be time to say farewell.
I'm actually very grateful that you accepted this job.
So Titania, please take this...
Me?
Actually, this was discovered in the ancient ruins along with the clock hand.
It's said to keep evil at bay, actually.
I'm certain that right now, you're actually the only one who can master this.
Alright. I'll try to use it.
That's the stuff!
Of course, we shall also spare no effort in doing whatever we can to help.
We shall continue researching ways to attack the problem of Real Nightmare.
That's reassuring, so yes, please do.
So, how are we gonna storm the enemy camp?
No worries there. Reinforcements are coming.
I'm surprised you were able to find that. Good work.
That's definitely a surveillance lacrima.
It's repaired and the recorded footage has been restored as much as possible.
I see. Play it back right now.
Yes, sir!
This is the priest who periodically visited the members of Oracion Seis.
Freeze it! Enhance!
Yes, sir!
That's...
You... You were the one?!
Alright, go big, old man!
Right! Leave it to me, laddy!
Lackeys, get in position!
Roger!
Supersonic Jiggle Butt, begin!
Awesome!
Go! Just one more effort!
Don't take a break!
But this is pretty tiring!
I know your asses can do it!
When it comes to flames that don't use magic, I'm sure you guys can pull it off!
Matter of fact, you idiots were the ones who came up with this plan,
so believe in yourselves and shake that ass!
That's the redesigned Christina!
I see. Blue Pegasus...
This is the reinforcements?
The Infinity Clock is in the sky. So we have to get airborne, too.
Not one of my favorite people, though...
Would you quit your grumbling and get on board?!
I'm stuck here minding the fort again?
My divination is on target this time!
We leave the attack to the handpicked team and do what we can do on the ground.
Everyone! Let's get fired up and begin making our attack!
Let's move out! Men!
Hey! Control this thing!
Ichiya, is something wrong?!
The stern's taken damage!
I'll take a look. Everyone, stay here.
M-Men!
Nee-chan! Me too!
It's broken!
More precisely, somebody broke it!
In that case...
An intruder...
Nee-chan!
Oracion Seis...
Racer?!
Bastard... Somehow, you sneaked on board. An impressive Man!
I'm going to... throw you overboard.
He disappeared?!
Bastard!
You're slow.
I'll get you for that.
Are you... fast?
Here I come!
Nee-san!
Leave him to me! Go back by everyone!
I'll be fine!
Everyone, that was...
Racer?!
Mira...
Ichiya! Go after Mira!
Men! Don't be ridiculous!
Leave him to my sister!
What?!
But...
Never mind, just hurry!
Please...
Alright! First, repairs!
Everybody, pitch in!
Sure!
I'm counting on you, Mira.
You're not going back there!
Don't interfere.
I told you... You're not getting on that ship!
Brats... Survive and come home.
Hey! Kinana's not here.
Say what?!
What's wrong?
Since the other day, her spells have gotten worse.
What?!
I can hear you.
I can hear you...
You're calling me...
You're doin' it! More! More!
Alright! Now!
Hey! Fire! Somebody, help!
Get over here!
My butt's on fire!
It's so hot!
Help us! Help!
That voice...
Help us! Hurry up!
We can't allow this! The fire extinguisher lacrima!
We're gonna let you people out just temporarily...
Hey, that's cool!
Hurry, get out of there!
You don't need to tell me that.
He's strong!
Boss, this is no time to be moved!
Our butts are still on fire!
Alright, get out of here!
We'll handle this!
After all, our butts are on fire! It'd be a waste not to use them!
Lackeys, fire!
Roger!
Gas-Butt Triple Ecstasy! Fire Special!
Awesome!
The fire's out, too!
This is what you call killing two birds with one stone!
Now I'm goin' straight to Lucy!
Wait!
Coco! What are you doin' here?!
Uh, she's gotta be a prisoner.
Take me with you!
That wizard broke out?
What shall we do?
He's already too late.
Real Nightmare is going to be activated.
The endless nightmare is beginning.
Chaos...
Cover the whole world...
What's happening with Gray and Juvia lately?
I'm not interested in that half-naked bastard!
Huh. Then I wonder what's gonna happen with Elfman and Eva?
Don't know, don't care!
I see. I guess it's what you might call Spiral of Love, huh?
Wouldn't it be better to say Labyrinth of Love?
Next time: Spiral of Time!
Y'know, you don't have to bend over backwards to tie into the title.
I wasn't thinking about that!
You can't even look me in the eye!
