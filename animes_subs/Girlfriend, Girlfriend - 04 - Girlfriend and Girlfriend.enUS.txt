The three of us, in our two-timing relationship,
started living together so we could grow closer.
Things were going well for a while, but Saki-chan's acting weird!
I can't...
I would be betraying Minase-san.
Huh? What's wrong?
Wait!
Saki-chan has gone home, and she won't open up to me,
even if I give her what she loves: cake, games, or cat and dog videos.
I needed to find a way to talk to her!
And that's when Minase-san took one for the team!
I'm not losing this opportunity!
Please, talk to me!
Saki-chan!
Do not try this at home
Why did you leave?
Saki-san...
Saki-chan...
B-Because Nagisa-chan's...
better than me.
She tries so hard for you!
She's even good at cooking!
That's not true! You're perfectly...
I can't do anything!
My boobs aren't even as big!
Let's not go there!
Besides, I can't even think of anything I can do for you.
Saki-chan...
Anyway, that's all I've got to say.
You'll be happy with just Nagisa-chan soon enough!
That's not true!
He's right, Saki-san.
Forget it.
Let me go!
I'm really happy just getting to be with you.
I don't care!
At least tell me what you want me to do!
You're good enough as you are!
You idiot!

N-Naoya-kun...
I want to...
I want to do something for Naoya, too.
Even just the other day...
Naoya, is there anything you want me to do?
No. In fact, is there anything you want me to do?
No, it's always been like that.
I don't mean to brag, but I'm terrible at doing chores.
Of course. You can take a break.
The bath's ready, too.
I made some tea.
Even now!
Why don't you ask anything of me?!
S-S-Saki-san!
Sure, there's a lot that I wish I could have you do for me.
But I'm still responsible for having started this relationship.
I think I need to first do my best for the both of you.
May I?
I can't blame Saki-san for having left.
Huh? Minase-san?
There's so much I want to do for you, too, but you always tell me I'm doing enough.
You tell me you'll do it.
I can't stand that.
No!
Minase-san...
I want to devote at least 18 hours a day to you!
That's too much.
She's right, though.
I appreciate you doing things for me...
But I want to make you happy, too.
I want to make you love me more.
I get it, Saki-san.
Right?
I'm Naoya's...
I'm also Naoya-kun's...
Saki-chan, Minase-san...
Please don't take on the responsibility for dating two people all on your own!
You're an equal with the two of us.
Isn't that the whole point of dating?
I thought I couldn't be allowed to be happy until I made the two of you happy,
because I'm two-timing.
I was stupid!
Hit me!
No...
Saki-san?!
He told me what he wanted, so...
That's how you took it?!
That's what I like about you.
It's why you're fun to be around.
Naoya...
And there's a lot that I want you to do.
I want to see you smile more!
Y-You got it!
And I want to see you angry more!
How's this?
I want your home cooking!
I'll feed you char!
I want to see your swimsuit in summer!
You'll see it!
And someday, a three
Not happening!
And more than anything,
I want the three of us to continue living together.
I know that.
Jeez.
Saki-san!
Hey...
Thanks.
I'm glad you two are on the same page.
N-Nah, but...
Nagisa-chan is still...
my r-rival!
Right.
I'm going to put up a fight.
Nuh... G-g-ggh...
Saki has returned home.
Girlfriend, Girlfriend
Staaare...
Those must be nice to squeeze.
Saki-san, dinner's ready!
I worked really hard on dinner to commemorate your return.
It looks delicious.
You worked so hard on this dinner,
and Naoya is...
He stayed up three whole nights to try to patch things up with you.
Oh, yeah...
Well, let's eat before it gets cold.
Time to eat!
Yum!
I'm glad you like it.
B-But just to be clear, you and I are still rivals.
I-I know.
But I like you, Saki-san.
I want us to be friends.
I do, too!
You're so adorable.
Although we're playing right into Naoya's hands if we get friendly.
You're so awesome, though!
It'll be so much fun if we become friends!
Y-You have high expectations.
No matter what we do, it'll be fun as hell!
Wait...
So how are we going to be friends?
I happen to like gaming.
Um...
Will you play with me?!
I used to play that game.
I'd totally do that.
Really?!
So how many hours did you play?
Um...
Probably about 1,000 hours.
Seriously? Wow!
I'm not good at it, though.
Would you really say that after 1,000 hours?
No, I'm really not.
Sure, sure.
Let's see what you've got.
I can't wait!
I'll d-do what I can!
Huh? You're dead already?
S-Sorry.
Don't worry. It's all right.
Okay, could you scout from the top of the mountain?
Okay.
FALL
Sorry.
You can at least drive, right?
I'm going to crash!
CRASH
You really do suck.
Can anyone who's played 1,000 hours be this bad?
I'm sorry I couldn't live up to your expectations.
It's not fun playing with me, is it?
That's not true.
Carrying the team is actually fun!
I can really show off my skills!
Really?
All right.
We aren't going to sleep until I get you a kill.
I don't think we'll ever get to sleep, then.
Don't worry.
Just follow me.
O-Okay.
Enemy footsteps!
Ahead!
They got me again.
Oh, dear.
It's all right.
I'll help you... out!
You're so good, Saki-san!
Nah.
You're so cute when you die right away, too.
How is that cute?
Come on.
Hurry over here!
Not again.
Okay, one more time.
I'll give poor widdle you all my heals.
Am I a baby now?!
It looks like you're having a lot more fun now.
Yeah!
I'm having fun besting you at something for the first time!
I'm having mixed feelings!
Look, someone's AFK!
Come on.
Take careful aim.
Right!
Aim really carefully.
Stay calm.
O-Okay.
Fire!
Don't shoot me!
M-My hand slipped!
Was that revenge for me being better?
You're scary.
No, I really...
Saki-san, I, uh...
You're so hilarious, Nagisa-chan!
S-Saki-san?
Who misses in that situation?!
And the kill you finally got was on me!
I-I'm sorry.
It's fine.
That was fun.
Saki-san...
Besides, I thought my rival was perfect, but she's actually really clumsy.
S-Saki-san...
Hey, were you two playing together?
Naoya-kun...
Well, Nagisa-chan's my rival, but she's cute.
Let's play again.
Add me as a friend.
Okay!
I know. I'll watch some MeTube gameplay videos and practice playing.
Can I watch, too?

TOP SNIPER
Oh, her.
She's one of the bad kind of booby streamers,
the ones who get views even though they suck.
Oh, but your boobies are good.
Look at this.
The thumbnail's so shameless.
TOP SNIPER
Th-That's true.
I hate her more than every other MeTuber right now.
Huh?
That uniform in the background...
Isn't that from our school?
Girlfriend, Girlfriend
I actually like the videos on this channel.
Naoya's hooked on boobs!
Morning, Sakisaki.
Oh, good morning.
Walking to school together again?
You two sure are attached at the hip.
Oh, yeah, for our club meeting today, Sensei is...
It's a steak lunch!
Yum!
Let's play again when we get home, Nagisa-chan.
Okay.
I've been studying videos in preparation.
The thumbnail for that video changed.
Which video?

The one by that Milika person, with our uniform in the background.
TOP SNIPER
It's the bad booby streamer!
TOP SNIPER
TOP SNIPER
Oh, but your boobies are good.
The title hasn't changed, either.
It's just the thumbnail.
Maybe she really is from our school, if she had to hide her uniform.
Seems like it.
What a loser, though.
If you have something to hide, you have to be really careful, like us.
The gym storage door is always locked.
And I'm careful to lock the window, too, since it's the only other way in.
I forgot to lock the window!
There are people here!
Wow, she's cute.
W-We need an excuse!
Right!
Let's see...
One guy and two girls in the gym storage?
Were you people...
doing something nasty?
The three of you?
Nope!
I don't believe you.
It's true!
Naoya...
I may be two-timing, but I promised not to do anything sexy!
Especially not a threes
You idiot!
Huh? Two-timing?
No, um...
Are you guys...
Are you three in a relationship together?
N-No, um...
W-We're, um...
Shoot...
We've been caught!
At least make an effort to deceive her!
Seriously? You're so weird.
Huh? Isn't she...
Please, don't tell anyone.
Yeah? A secret, huh?
I don't know...
What should I do?
It's hilarious how freaked out you are.
I-I'm begging you!
Saki-san...
Um, are you...
I've got this, you two!
Take this and keep your mouth shut.
Wh-What is this?
Inside is 200,000 yen.
So sketchy!
I've saved up that money since I was a kid. It's my life savings.
I kept it on me in case something like this happened.
For something like this? This?
Wh-What's up with this guy?
T-Too bad for you, though.
I have plenty of money.
I make more than this every month.
As a high schooler? No way.
Hey, are you...
You're not...
doing something reprehensible to make money, are you?!
Huh?
You are cute, and you have huge eyes, but...
H-Hey!
But what if your client is a dangerous grown-up?!
He might deceive you, con you, and mess you up.
And he'll record the act and sell it.
Record the act and sell it...
Record the act and sell it...
Record the act and sell it!
Oh, no!

Hoshi zaki Ri ka's unexpected debut!
Milika's
Her pure heart steals yours!
Before you know it, you'll be a super-popular adult star!
Go, me!
Wait...
I'm not doing that!
Are you sure?
Then what about the money?
Do you even get the situation you're in?
Hey...
You're Milika-san, the MeTuber, right?
Huh?
Huh?
S-Seriously?
Yes.
She has the same eyes and hair.
And she has big breasts.
The money you're talking about is from video views, right?
I have n-no idea what you're talking about.
Now that you mention it...
And above all, our uniform was in your thumbnail.
I took a screenshot of it.
But I saw that and deleted it right after I uploaded it!
Shoot!
I see.
We're even now.
No, we have the upper hand.
You don't want your identity getting out, do you?
Oh, I bet you came here because you didn't want people to figure out who you are.
I-I'll kill you if you tell anyone!
I don't know...
What should I do?
Did I take it too far?
Sorry!
There. Now we're even.
I went too far.
But I feel better now.
Saki-chan...
Don't worry.
I'd never tell anyone.
Y-You'd better not.
Not to worry!
Even if you tell people about us, I'll take your secret to the grave!
I won't perpetuate a cycle of sadness!
Nah, I'd say it, if it came to that.
Saki-san!
You're good people, for a bunch of weirdos in a threesome.
Who are you calling a weirdo?
I know!
I've made up my mind.
You there.
I'll be your girlfriend, too!
Huh?
Huh?
Uh?
What?!

Do you play or watch games?
I totally play. I love gaming!

I earn views on gameplay footage.
And I earn more views with my cleavage!
I will not allow the desecration of gaming!
