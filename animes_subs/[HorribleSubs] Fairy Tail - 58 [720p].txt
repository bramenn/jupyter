Oh, no!
Not only has Jellal been resurrected, but the seal on Nirvana has...
We may have defeated one of Oracion Seis,
but it seems like bad things are happening all around!
And that's exactly why you can't get a boyfriend.
H-Huh? What does that have to do with anything?
If it's love and dreams and you it'll become magical.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
I kind of admired this powerful world,
chock-full of problems.
Frozen time has started to move again
ever since I met you.
Why were we born? Why do we live?
I don't need any complicated answers.
Laugh! Cry! Be honest with yourself.
Simple feelings are the most important.
You can change those tears shed on sad nights into strength.
Now, let's cast a smile spell!
So basically, under that light, good and evil are switched, right?
What'll we do? If Natsu turns into that...
I don't care who, just come at me!
I'll beat the crap outta you all, and destroy everything!
Uh...
I think he might not be all that different...
Guess good and evil don't really matter much to him.
Anyway, we should hurry.
We need to follow after Natsu-kun and Erza-san,
and find some way to stop Nirvana!
Jellal! Your days are numbered!
I ain't gonna let you get anywhere near Erza!
Spirit vs. Spirit!
This smell...
I knew it! Gray!
What the hell are you doing here?
What happened to the speedy one?
Hey!
Damn it... I'm in a hurry here!
Wake up, idiot!
Gray...
Gray?
On a raft?!
Looks like you fell for it, Natsu.
Your weak point really is transportation.
So how do you like the feeling of riding a raft bobbing up and down...
You're... not...
Shut up! Hurry up and kick the bucket, you slant-eyed, seasick bastard!
Or something like that...
The usual battle between us two...
Who's there?
What are you doing, Gray?
It's us!
As it were, moshimoshi!
L-Lucy...
Would you try and refrain from hurling after saying my name?
Moshimoshi.
Anyway, that's horrible! You're going too far, Gray!
Unless he stole your fish or something, then it's okay!
Even then, I don't think so.
Shut up, jerks.
You're annoying.
I'll get to you after I finish this guy off, so don't get in my way!
Gray...
W-What is this? Could Gray have fallen into the darkness?
It's...
It's stopped, so get it together already!
Natsu, I'm coming to save you!
He-cat!
Happy, what are you doing?
Happy can fly in the sky. He can carry one person.
He has no offensive abilities.
Information gathering complete.
What are you saying, Gray? Wake up, already!
Is that how you become if you fall into darkness from Nirvana's influence?
Lucy as seen by Gray: A newcomer to the guild. Looks are very much to his liking.
Somewhat interested in her.
W-What the heck?
More naive than at first glance. A Celestial Spirit Wizard.
Spirits, eh?
Interesting!
No... You aren't Gray-kun.
Who are you?
Not Gray?
A member of Blue Pegasus. Handsome.
Doesn't know the details.
Lack of information, huh?
He is acting strange, that's true.
Is this the effect of Nirvana?
That's right...
The people who fall into darkness are ones with feelings in the gap between good and evil...
Gray isn't one to be moved so much by those kinds of feelings!
Who are you?
M-Me?
Are you dumb?
Even if you transform into Lucy-san, you aren't going to fool us.
I wonder about that. Men like you have a weak spot for women, yes?
Men...
B-Bobbing...
Indeed!
Cut it out with the boob bobbing ogling!
Honestly! What an uncouth wizard you are!
It's not me! It's that one! Although that's me! Argh, I don't know anymore!
Spirit information gathering complete.
Oh, wow! You have quite a lot of keys.
You've even had an audience with the Spirit King?
And your magical power isn't anything to laugh at either.
Well, whatever. Sagittarius?
If you please...
Moshimoshi?
Sagittarius?
What is with this traitorous horse?
N-No, it's not me!
I would never... do something like...
Hibiki, hang in there!
Are you manipulating my Spirits?
Yes! Right now, I can do everything you can.
I apologize, Lucy-dono, Hibiki-dono...
My body is moving on its own...
Carla! Take Wendy and escape! This guy's dangerous!
I would even if you didn't tell me to!
Sagittarius, I'm going to force your gate closed! You take a break for a while!
I truly apologize, as it were. Moshimoshi.
In that case... Gate of the Archer, I open thee!
Sagittarius!
You called? Moshimoshi.
Uh, what?
What in the world is going on? Moshimoshi.
I'm the one who summoned you.
So that means I'm your owner right now.
That is very true. Moshimoshi.
So with that settled, would you shoot down that flying cat for me?
W-Well, I...
What is it?
Are you disobeying your owner?
Even if your body and abilities are the same...
You are not the real Lucy-dono!
Even though I know this...
Don't do it, Sagittarius!
L-Lucy-dono...
Understood!
Sagittarius, forced closure!
Not gonna work. I summoned him, after all.
Only I can do a forced closure.
But...
Now, hurry up and shoot that cat!
Oh, don't worry about her.
Now that we've found Nirvana, that brat's role is over.
Oh, I see!
Sagittarius!
Lucy-dono... Next time I'll be more helpful, really!
Moshimoshi...
Hi, Lucy-chan!
Angel-chan is here!
You're one of Oracion Seis!
Yup!
And these guys can copy the body, powers, and thoughts of their opponent completely!
I'm Gemi!
And I'm Mini!
The Twin Spirits, Gemini.
I'm a Celestial Wizard too.
A Celestial Wizard? Just like me...
Just like it's not certain that we'll fall into darkness,
Oracion Seis isn't going to turn good so easily either.
Right now, Nirvana's effect doesn't matter!
Hibiki and Natsu can't fight.
I have to do something!
Thankfully, there's a stream here... with water!
I'd like those keys you have.
I'm going to wipe you out and take your Spirits.
I won't let you do that!
Gate of the Water Bearer, I open thee!
Gemini, gate closure.
Aquarius!
Get her! I don't care if I get swept up in it!
That's what I was intending from the start.
From the start?
I blow everyone away!
Gate of the Scorpion, I open thee!
The Scorpion? That's one of the Zodiac!
Scorpio!
We are! Yeah!
Scorpio!
What?!
We are! How you been, Aquarius?
It's been a while, yeah!
I was so lonely! *sob-sob*
Don't tell me... That boyfriend you talk about...
Yup! This is him!
We are!
How do you do, Aquarius's owner?
Yeah!
Bam! And wait, what does this do to Aquarius's character?
Just try saying something negative about my Scorpio...
You ain't never gonna recover, you got it?
Yes.
She was totally serious!
We are! There's a restaurant where we can see Aurora...
So anyway, can I go back, Angel?
Yeah...
Go ahead!
Aquarius, wait!
A little girl who doesn't even know about the relationship between Spirits...
What'll I do? My most powerful Spirit is blocked...
Wait! I have another one!
The most powerful Spirit!
Your prince has arrived.
L-Leo?
Please! If you don't defeat her, then the guild will be...
No sweat.
Perhaps I didn't tell you?
What's most important is the relationship between the Spirits.
Gate of the Ram, I open thee.
Aries!
I'm sorry, Leo...
Aries?
She was... Karen's...
Karen's Spirit Aries...
Why is she here?
Loke can't fight like this!
Aries...
Karen's Spirit?
Why do you have Karen's Spirit?
Because I'm the one that offed her!
This here is just the spoils of battle.
I'm sorry!
Even though that woman didn't have much magic power,
she tried to force a simultaneous release of two spirits.
She did herself in.
Although I was the one that finished her off.
I've taken the keys of all kinds of Celestial Wizards that I've wiped out.
I'm also gonna take those Spirits you use.
Karen...
Karen... This woman did it...
To my... beloved...
It was you...
You Celestial Wizard...
You...
It was your fault...
No! I'm being consumed by hatred!
My heart is going to be stolen by Nirvana!
I'm falling into darkness!
I can't think like that!
You finally meet again, but as enemies?
Loke, go back to your world.
Don't think so little of me, Lucy.
Even if we were once friends, with different owners, we are now enemies.
Spirits fight for their masters.
Even if it's against someone they have feelings for,
we will defeat the enemy for our master!
That is our...
Oh, no...
Oh? They're going at it?
Well, this is interesting in its own way, so go ahead.
No...
This... This... isn't right!
Wool Bomb!
As expected from the leader of the Zodiacs...
She's no match for Leo, the Spirit specializing in battle, I guess.
Well, in that case...
Gate of the the Chisel, I open thee!
Caelum!
Okay, Caelum, target.
Aim for when Aries stops Leo's movement!
That worked great!
Leo!
Aries...
I'm sorry, Lucy...
I'm glad you met a nice owner...
So how do you like my simultaneous release?
I don't think you'll be using your powerhouse Leo anytime soon.
I can't believe you...
What? It's not like Spirits die anyway, so what's the big deal?
But they feel pain!
They have feelings!
And yet you call yourself a Celestial Wizard?
Gate of the Bull, I open thee!
Taurus!
Gemini!
I don't care who it is, if you make my Nice Body cry, I won't forgive you!
Come here, Moo-moo-chan!
Lucy-san!
And another one bites the dust!
Mooore!
Taurus!
Huh? Why am I...
You can't use so many Spirits like that without a huge amount of magical power.
But...
Literally bringing defeat upon herself... What a dope!
Serves you right!
Serves you right...
What's that look for? I don't like it.
Release Aries from her contract!
Huh? What?
She was abused by her previous owner.
And went through nothing but hardships...
So...
And what do people say when they ask for favors again, Lucy-chan?
P-Please...
I want to let Aries and Loke be together!
It's we Celestial Wizards who are the only ones who can do that for them!
For free?
I'll give you anything.
Other than my keys, I'll give you anything!
Then that would be your life.
Gemini, do it!
Gemini?
Her beautiful voice... resounds...
Mama, Mama!
I love Spirits!
Spirits aren't shields!
I can't just let my friend disappear in front of my eyes!
I can't do it...
Lucy...
She loves us Spirits!
Gemini...
Begone!
How useless!
Hibiki?
Wait, did the cool one fall into darkness?
Hold still.
My magic, Archive, is going to give you the knowledge of a super powerful spell, just this once!
What is this?
Inside... my head...
Figures I don't understand!
That was close... I almost fell into darkness.
But the bonds you have with your Spirits wrapped me in the light.
I know you'll be able to use this magic!
Damn you! Caelum!
I'm counting on you, Lucy!
Measure heaven, open heaven.
Make unto my body as to shine with the radiance of the countless stars.
Tetra Biblos, I am the ruler of the stars.
Aspect, cast open the gate of perfect malevolence...
What is this? Caelum, hurry!
The 88 Stars of the Heavens.
Shine!
Urano Meteoria!
Huh?
I figured you'd be able to do it.
Urano Meteoria...
I thought I blew Jellal away at the Tower of Heaven...
Why is he here again?
He must be a ghost!
And he's come back for revenge!
Ghosts can't use magic!
Then maybe he's an identical twin?
Don't you remember? The twin was a fake he made with magic.
A cat's brain can't think of anything else.
Next time: Recollections of Jellal.
Can't go relying on your brain, can we, Happy?
Although I think I'm way smarter than you, Natsu!
Say what?!
