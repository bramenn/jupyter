In the year 845...
the Colossal and Armored Titans
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,
along with the life we'd known.
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,
losing twenty percent of its population and a third of its territory,
to retreat within Wall Rose.
And in the year 850, in Trost...
Once again, humanity could not stop a Titan invasion.
Eren Jaeger had been devoured by a Titan,
but reappeared, emerging from a mysterious Titan.
Response The Battle for Trost (6)
I'll ask you once more!
What are you?!
A human!
I see...
Then don't hate me for this.
Marco...
I can't...
I can't fight the Titans anymore!
What happened?
My friends were eaten right in front of me!
I saw them devoured,
and I didn't even feel sad or angry...
All I could think was, I'm so glad that it wasn't me!
But...
Next time, it'll be me...
I realized something.
Essentially, our job
is to fight the Titans until they eat us, isn't it?
I'd rather die right now than be eaten!
Stop it...
Get a hold of yourself!
You aren't the only one.
Everyone is struggling with that fear!
Look at Sasha!
Even after what happened, she is still a proud soldier!
I have a terrible stomachache.
May I go join the wounded?
I can't do this anymore!
Stop it!
Stop!
I guess that gag order was indeed necessary...
Just look at them now.
If they learn about Eren...
A cannon shot?
Why only one?
Look! Smoke!
From inside the wall!
What?
What's going on?
Did they break through the floodgate?
No way! That's the strongest part...
Someone just screwed up and dropped a shell.
But why is there so much smoke?
It can't be... A Titan's steam?
Wait!
Hey...
What is going on here?
It's alive...
Captain Wellman!
J-Just look at it!
It's too dangerous to get close!
Maintain your position and remain on high alert!
Maintain your position!
Have the gunners load another round!
What is this?
I remember hearing the cannon fire...
And then there was a horrible sound, a shock wave, and heat...
Are we inside a huge skeleton
Eren protected us.
That's all we need to know for now.
Flowers survived, only inside...?
Hey!
Are you guys okay?!
Eren!
What is this?
No idea...
But this thing will soon dissipate like any other Titan corpse...
Let's get away from it!
Are they in shock, or just waiting to see what we'll do?
The Garrison isn't doing anything right now, but...
They'll attack again before long.
After showing them this, I doubt we'll be able to talk our way out.
But I do remember one thing...
The basement.
The basement of my house.
Dad said that if I go there, I'll learn everything.
This happened to me because of him, too.
If I go to the basement,
I'll probably learn what the Titans really are.
Damn it!
Then why did he hide it?
Isn't that information
what thousands of Survey Corps soldiers died for?
Isn't it humanity's last hope?
And he's been keeping it locked in the basement of our house?
What the hell was he thinking?
Where the hell has he been the past five years, anyway?
Eren.
Right now, we have other priorities.
Yeah.
The smoke's clearing.
When you see them, attack.
Let's end this here.
Don't move yet!
I'm getting out of here.
Where will you go? And how?
For now, I don't care where.
But from there, over the walls, to the basement.
Once I become a Titan again.
Can you do that?
I don't know how I do it myself.
But I still think I can!
It's similar to the way you can't explain how you move your own arm.
Back there,
my only thought was stopping that shell.
So that body had no other function and rotted away after having served its purpose.
This time, I'll turn into something stronger.
A 15-meter class, like the one that tore apart those Titans.
Eren.
Your nose is bleeding.
You look pale, and your breaths are ragged.
Your body is in bad shape!
How I feel doesn't matter.
I've come up with two options.
First, if you don't try to protect me, at least they won't kill you.
Although I've already caused you trouble.
I'm thinking of leaving here alone.
No...
I'll go, too
Eren,
I'm coming with you.
No!
If I can't keep up, you don't need to worry about me.
But I don't have to do what you say.
I've told you to stop all that!
I'm not your little brother, and I'm not a child!
Yeast (1) A special yeast made only within Wall Sina keeps fodder, wheat, beans, and other items from spoiling for a long time when placed in storerooms or tents.
Yeast (2) By seeding storage caches with this yeast along supply lanes, humanity prepares to retake Wall Maria.
Captain, the next round will be loaded soon.
Should we attack again?
Wait for my signal!
Yes, sir.
The Garrison's giving no indication of moving to attack with their blades.
Mikasa's more sensitive than a stray cat to those things.
Loading the next round will probably take
a minimum of another twenty seconds.
Before then, Eren will have made his move and left...
Why would I remember these things at a time like this?
Is it because this is it for us?
And at the end, I was
nothing more than a coward, after all...
They saved me over and over,
but I was never able to save them.
As a friend, how can I stand on equal ground with them?
How could I say I'd go with them?
When even I'm not sure I can?
Now, the three of us
will probably never be together again...
Eren, I...
Wait, Mikasa.
I said I've come up with two options.
Armin,
I'll let you decide.
Huh?
I know what I've just said isn't that realistic.
The smartest thing to do
would be to stay with the troops and use this ability strategically.
I know it's crazy...
But if you think you can convince the Garrison I'm not a threat right now,
I will trust your judgment and follow your lead.
That's my second option.
If you say you can't, I'll do what I described before.
You have fifteen seconds to decide.
Whether or not you can,
I'll respect your decision.
Eren...
Why would you entrust me with this choice?
Whenever things get really bad,
you always know the right thing to do.
And I want to rely on you.
When have I...
There have been plenty of times.
Five years ago, if you hadn't called Hannes,
Titans would have eaten Mikasa and me.
Was it all...
just in my head?
Only I thought that I was useless? That I was just slowing them down?
These two never thought that for a second!
Armin, we're out of time!
Looks like the next round is loaded.
We can fire any time.
These two are putting their lives in my hands.
The two people I trust most in the world...
What could be more convincing than that?
I will persuade them.
The two of you, avoid doing anything that'd make them think you're a threat.
Ever since Eren became a Titan and fought for us,
something has been bothering me.
I don't have it all clear in my head, but I'll do this!
I'll figure it out while I speak!
Stop!
You've finally shown your true self, monster!
I'll do it!
I'll give the signal!
He is not an enemy of humanity!
We are prepared to share all the information we have!
I'm not interested in hearing you plead for your lives!
How can I believe you, when he's shown us all what he really is?
If you say he's not an enemy, then prove it!
If you can't, I'll be forced to eliminate the threat!
There is no need for proof!
That's right... We don't.
The question isn't what we think of him!
What did you say?
I'm told that many of you saw him!
Then you saw him fighting the Titans!
And you saw the Titans swarm him!
That means the Titans considered him food, the same way they think of us!
That is the truth, no matter what we may think or believe!
He's right...
A Titan as an ally?
That's impossible.
But if we could control a Titan...
Prepare to attack!
Don't be fooled by their clever lies!
The Titans' actions have always been beyond our understanding!
It's possible they could pretend to be human,
speak human languages, and try to deceive us!
We can't let them get away with anything else!
No...
He isn't even trying to think!
He's scared of thinking!
Eren... Mikasa!
I am a soldier!
I swore long ago to dedicate my life to the revival of humanity!
If that pursuit were to cost me my life, I would be glad!
If we use his Titan powers and the forces we still have,
we could take back this town!
With my final breath before my death,
I shall wish for humanity's glory,
and try to persuade you of his strategic value!
Captain Wellman, I believe we should consider
Shut up!
Their pleas are irrelevant.
They are traitors.
Anyone who violates the rules must be eliminated.
That is my duty as a soldier!
Enough.
As big as you are, you've always been as delicate as a newborn fawn.
Commander Pixis!
Do you not see his splendid salute?
I've just arrived, but messengers have kept me abreast of the situation.
You go command the reinforcements.
I think we should listen to them...
Reports by the Survey Corps had said
the Titans would come from the south.
In fact, it was Zhiganshina District,
south of Wall Maria, that was attacked.
Thus, it was widely believed that the district south of Wall Rose,
Trost, had the highest likelihood of being the next target.
Trost District, Inner Gate
Dot Pixis...
He is the High Commander
of the entire southern region, including Trost.
The man with absolute authority over
the defense of humanity's most important region.
No luck, huh?
I wouldn't mind being eaten by a really beautiful Titan woman.
And he is known to be a total eccentric.
What is the Commander thinking?
Allowing them up there unguarded,
when we don't know what they are...
I don't know.
The Commander's ideas are always beyond normal people's comprehension.
Captain...
The squads are in formation.
Oh, excellent.
I see.
And if we reach this basement, we'll understand everything?
Yes... Will you believe me?
As long as you, yourself, lack absolute conviction,
I can't promise more than that I'll keep it in mind.
But I do take pride in being able to recognize the truth of what I see.
I'll guarantee your safety.
Trainee Arlert, was it?
Yes, sir!
Back there, you said we could use
the Titan's power to reclaim this city.
Did you really think so?
Or was it just a plea to save your life?
Well...
Both.
What I meant was to have
Eren become a Titan, then move that boulder
to seal the destroyed gate.
But it was just an idea...
I thought I could get them to at least
at least consider using Eren's power to find a way out of our predicament.
Of course, I wanted to survive!
You wanted to survive.
I can trust those words more than any others.
Well, Trainee Jaeger?
Yes?
Can you seal that hole?
Well... Well...
I don't know.
I don't know much more than everyone else here does.
So... whether I can do it or not,
I can't answer you for sure when I don't know.
That's true.
I'm sorry.
I asked the wrong question.
Will you do it? Or won't you?
I'll do it.
I'll do it!
I don't know whether I can seal the hole...
But I'll do it!
Although they had fled out of fear,
soldiers choose to stand once more on the battlefield.
Eren decides to become everyone's hope.
