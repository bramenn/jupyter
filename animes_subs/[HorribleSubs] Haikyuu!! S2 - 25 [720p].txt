Give it to me!
All...
Yes!
Well done!
That was no ordinary prefectural qualifier match.
I got goosebumps.
All right! Let's do our greetings.
Right!
Now we're at one loss, one win.
Don't get on your high horse.
I won't.
Haikyu!!
Episode 25: Declaration of War
Thank you very much!
We did it, Sensei.
Yes.
It...
looked like he was actually able to predict where Hinata was going to hit.
If it wasn't caught by the block, changing the course,
That was a very heartwarming match.
he might have picked it up.
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
Say what you will, but the results are what you see.
There's no way your disappointment will subside.
I'm sure there are even some plays you regret.
You fought well.
Let's go greet the people in the stands.
How can I be the ace when I couldn't even make that?!
Thank you very much!
Rule the Court
Thank you very much!
Hey, hurry up!
Yeah!
We fell over!
You're way too worked up!
Hinata, you dumbass!
Don't ever forget this sight.
We're definitely going to pay them back.
Yeah!
Apparently we're about to head out.
Yeah.
Karasuno High School Volleyball Club
Kageyama!
We're not gonna lose next time!
Apparently.
Right.
Hey!
You guys were awesome!
Yay!
Ne-san!
Ryu!
You did great, getting that last one!
You looked awesome!
Right...
Or rather, I appreciate the support, but don't use my name so much...
Don't be embarrassed!
Ow, ow, ow! Seriously, stop!
Hey, your boobs! Your boobs are in my face!
That was a great serve, Tadashi!
Thank you very much.
What? You can't handle some boobs in your face?
The last one! The last spike was amazing!
Thanks!
Thanks.
I couldn't help but remember our last match,
so when I saw the triple block, it was quite chilling...
Just like when Azumane faced the Iron Wall,
Kageyama might have thought
it was best to think ahead and have Hinata's hand break through...
No... It might just have been instinct.
It's so amazing that you got through such a high block!
That last part...
When the Great King reacted...
I thought he was going to get it.
The Great King really is amazing.
When the bus comes, will you load our stuff?
I'm gonna go get everyone else.
Right.
This is a warning, Oikawa.
Don't choose the wrong path again.
You chose the wrong path.
There was a place where you could have realized your true potential.
Because of your worthless pride, you didn't choose it.
So you're trying to tell me
that I should have gone to Shiratorizawa instead of Seijoh, right?
No team is guaranteed victory.
If nothing else, I can say...
Shiratorizawa Academy
Wow, I see you're still laughably confident!
Worthless pride, huh?
That's true...
Listen up, Ushijima.
I never thought my decision was wrong,
and my volleyball hasn't ended at all.
Don't you ever forget
my worthless pride.
Oh, yeah.
If you keep all of your attention on me,
you're going to get stabbed from the direction you least expect.
What's that supposed to mean?
My junior...
isn't smart, and isn't even close to my level yet...
But now that he's not by himself, he's strong.
When crows flock, they might even kill a huge, white eagle.
Hey.
What the hell are you doing?
Hurry up and load your your stuff onto the bus.
What's the matter, you two?
Infertile soil will not bring forth splendid fruit.
I'll show you just how much we can grow from the concrete.

Ah, w-wait!
The Japanese National High School Volleyball Tournament Miyagi Prefecture Qualifiers (Boys) Finals Shiratorizawa vs. Karasuno
Haikyu!!
Haikyu!!
No surprise. They're fast asleep.
You can't blame them.
They fought two matches with powerful opponents.
I'm thankful for you, Sensei.
Wha?! Where did that come from?
The fact that a team like ours, which hadn't done well for a while,
got to do so many practice matches with the powerhouse schools from Tokyo...
All I can say about that is that we were blessed.
You need someone else to become more disciplined.
No matter how hard you try by yourself, there's a limit.
The fact that we were able to regain our connection with Nekoma
is a much bigger deal than you or the team realizes.
You did an amazing thing.
What? No, I didn't...
If we're able to win tomorrow,
please make sure you compliment me then.
Right.
All right. Get your things and head straight to the gym for a meeting.
Right...
You totally drooled. Gross.
My drool isn't gross!
Oh, they're back.
Congrats on making it to the finals!
Oh, Michimiya.
How did you know?
They just announced it on the school announcements.
That's amazing!
The fact that you were able to beat Seijoh and made it to the finals is just... is just...
Amazing! It's insane!
Your lack of vocabulary is insane.
Wait, what happened to your face?! That bruise!
Yeah... It happened at the match today...
It looks a lot worse than it actually feels.
I see...
Hey, boys' volleyball team.
That was amazing!
Congrats!
Hinata! Kageyama! Well done!
Sensei!
Thanks!
I'm going to cheer you on tomorrow!
You better win!
Do your best!
You guys all stayed late for us...
M-Sta Miyagi is gonna start!
Good day-evening.
Good day-evening!
Today, the Sendai Municipal Gymnasium in Tomizawa
hosted the quarter and semifinals of the Miyagi prefectural qualifiers
for the National High School Volleyball Tournament,
otherwise known as the Spring Volleyball Tournament.
Karasuno Aoba Johsai
In the first match, Karasuno High School defeated
the powerhouse school, Aoba Johsai High School,
earning them a spot in the finals for the first time in years.
Wow, that is certainly surprising.
To think that Seijoh would be eliminated.
Precisely. With Oikawa-kun at the lead, they are an extremely well-balanced team,
so it's sad that we won't be seeing them in the finals.
Come on! Show us a little more!
We actually won!
Yeah! Yeah!
Stop showing just Seijoh!
This happens every time.
The lost in the semifinals. What do you expect?
Semifinals, Round 2 The Champions' Dignity
Next, we have the second round of the semifinals.
In this match, the school garnering attention rightfully won,
and moved toward the finals.
Now the headliner arrives.
It would be Shiratorizawa Academy,
that has won this tournament the last three years,
but is led by Ushijima Wakatoshi, who has played for the under-19 national team.
Shiratorizawa Academy Kesenike West High School
Looks like they had no problems winning straight through the semifinals.
Yes.
This year, they've gathered members that might just promise them victory at Nationals.
I think we can expect great things from them.
It'll be interesting to see how high Karasuno can climb
against the powerful Shiratorizawa Academy.
You can watch the finals live on this channel, tomorrow at 11 AM.
Tomorrow: Volleyball Spring Tournament Finals: 11:00 Live!
The match that will determine the Miyagi Prefecture representative...
Be sure not to miss it!
Now, then. We'll be going against Shiratorizawa tomorrow, but...
In the three years since Oikawa joined Aoba Johsai,
they have never beaten Shiratorizawa.
Not even once.
They are undoubtedly the undefeated champions.
Of course, there's Ushijima,
but there are plenty of others that are top in the prefecture.
It's no fluke that they are top in the prefecture.
Shiratorizawa is far stronger than you can even imagine.
No one actually thinks we're going to win.
Huh?
What is it, Hinata?
That doesn't matter!
I think...
Hey, don't talk to the coach like that!
Oh, uh... I didn't mean it like that...
Just say it.
R-Right.
No one thought that we were going to beat Seijoh, either.
That's why it doesn't matter...
I think.
Tomorrow, we're going to be the challengers again.
Let's turn the tables on them.
Right!
The fallen powerhouse. The flightless crows.
There's no one to call you that anymore.
Birds with the wind in their wings are flying across the great blue sky right now.
And all of you should be able to make it!
To the highest limit,
Karasuno High School Volleyball Club
to the farthest limit!
Now, everyone. The time has come!
Let's win tomorrow and make it to nationals!
Yeah!
All right. Now get home and go to bed so you aren't tired tomorrow.
Right.
All right, dismissed!
Right!
Kageyama.
Throw me a toss.
Huh? They couldn't be...
I knew it.
Ah! Yachi-san!
Could you throw us some balls?
You guys had two matches today, so you should just go home and rest up.
If I went home right now, I'd be too worked up to sleep.
So, please!
Please!
Throw it, please!
Okay.
Yeah!
Give me one more!
Yeah.
One more!
Yeah.
What's the matter, Yachi-san?
Oh! I-I'm sorry!
I just remembered something...
What did you remember?
The time you two got into that fight,
I kept throwing balls to you like this.
Really?
What?! You don't remember?!
Hinata like charged you and tried to fight with you,
and then Kageyama-kun started punching and pushed you over...
I was super scared!
O-Oh...
Sorry.
Oh, uh, that's not what I meant...
I thought of this, watching the match today.
If I hadn't become a manager,
I wouldn't have been able to watch today's matches,
wouldn't have been so excited and flustered,
or been so happy when you won,
and my heart wouldn't have felt so warm.
It's all because I watched each of you work so hard
to do something that you couldn't do before...
If I hadn't been here, I would have never had that experience.
So, thank you.
No, no! We should be thanking you!
You stayed with us through all our practices!
If you weren't with us, Yachi-san, we might not have completed our new quick, either!
Really? I was of some use, even though I'm just a Townsperson B?
Of course!
You're the best Townsperson B in the Tohoku region!
Is that even a compliment?
Of course it is!
If you're actually thankful, too, you need to thank her!
Ah... Thanks.
Is that all you can say?
There are so many other ways to say it!
Shut up! I thanked her, didn't I?
N-Now, now...
What are you doing?
Sh-Shimizu-senpai?!
Resting properly is another important part of preparing for matches, you know.
S-Sorry!
Come on! That's enough!
Let's clean up!
What?
Come on, hurry up!
Okay...
We got in trouble because of you.
You wanted to practice, too, didn't you?
I'm sorry for helping them practice.
No, it's fine.
Actually, thanks for practicing with them.
Right!
Hitoka-chan, it's already dark, so do you want me to go to the bus stop with you?
O-Okay!
Hinata and Kageyama, as soon as you're done, you need to go straight home.
Right!
I wonder how the Little Giant felt the day before the finals...
I'm super nervous,
but...
Isn't it even more exciting now?!
We're going to win tomorrow.
Yeah!
But man... Who ever thought that Karasuno would make it to the finals?
They beat Seijoh,
so maybe they're becoming a powerhouse again.
Hey, speaking of...
It's Ushiwaka.
H-Hey!
Hinata Shoyo. Kageyama Tobio.
We made it to the finals.
We, who grew from the concrete,
will beat you and go to nationals!
I look forward to it.
Let's meet on the court.
Damn it...
I wanna hurry up and fight him!
All right! We're gonna make it to the spring tournament, no matter what!
Yeah!
