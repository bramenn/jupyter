Mame Souichirou, 15 years old.
Starting today, I'm a freshman at Aoba Academy.
The reason why I chose this school
A fresh and exciting school life!
The first spring winds...
Let's not meet until our dreams are granted!
Ew!!
I love you!
I love you!

Baby I trust you my friend

The fight doesn't end until I fulfill my dream
I wonder how far I've come now?
In ten years, I'll be living the dream
It's the scenario I wrote for myself, so I'll have no regrets
But life isn't that easy, and it's full of obstacles
Still, I swear to myself that I won't ever back down
I have a dream that I absolutely want to achieve
So I fuel my passion until I succeed
There will be meetings and partings along the way
But I'll simply believe in my strength that you've taught me
And rise back up again and again and again

In this world, every day is dull and full of nonsense
I cover my ears, trying to mute the noise
Why do people hurt each other?
In the contradictory, overlapping shadows
on the recesses of my heart, fallen into despair
While carrying this pain in my chest,
can I really dream of tomorrow?
can I really dream of tomorrow?
Remembering the rainbow I found after the rain,

To Takagi Akito,
This was so sudden and it'll be time to see you soon.
Since I probably can't be honest when talking with you,
I slipped in this letter. __
I'm very happy I was able to see you, Takagi.
These are my true feelings. __
I want us to encourage each other. __
That's what I've always, always wanted.
I'm looking forward to meeting you at the zoo.
I'm praying for a wonderful date. __

Takagi and Iwase are...
What should I do?
That book...
Akina Aiko is definitely Iwase's pen name.
So he does prefer talented girls after all.
I'm just the cleaning lady.
The only one I can talk to about this is...
A letter from Iwase to Takagi?
Yeah.
It looks like they've been encouraging each other like you and Mashiro have.
For four years.
Have you asked Takagi what this is all about?
Not yet...
I'm scared to ask!
He's been making long calls at night lately, too.
He went on a date at the zoo for sure.
I wonder if Mashiro knew about it.
I won't forgive him if he did!
What? Mashiro has nothing to do with this.
Yes he does!
If he's been hiding it from you, then they're both awful.
B-But...
Since they're both working so hard to get published in NEXT,
let's wait until after they're finished to confront them.
Okay?
Can you hold out that long?
Yeah, I think I can make it somehow.
Kaya...
Anyway, for a gag manga, you need a good sense of humor, and lots of jokes!
Three laughs per page, for sure!
That's impossible...
No, you can do it!
The protagonist, Tanto!
The inventor grandfather, Chotto!
The heroine, Palette!
Your names are interesting and you've got a good, straightforward title!
Anyway, just keep throwing in any jokes you can think of!
Okay?
Um...
It's harder for gag manga to get high rankings than story manga, right?
That's true, but...
Plot Gag
At least with gag manga, it's easier to continue being serialized, even if it doesn't get that many votes.
We've already been serialized, so even if it's difficult, I want to keep aiming for first place.
Right, of course!
Let's aim for number one!
The deadline for the manuscript is early July, right?
Yeah, around the 10th.
I want to make the art simple and easy on the eyes,
and I think the character designs will take a while.
I see. But what's important in gag manga is the content and jokes.
Your art's almost too good already.
I want art that will appeal to kids as much as possible...
and characters with easy to recognize traits.
The protagonist still doesn't stand out from the other kids.
Yeah, that's true...
For example, Hiroshi from Gutsy Frog...
I think it's amazing.
Even though his face is generic, just because he's got those sunglasses on his head, you can recognize him immediately.
Yeah, I see what you're saying!
Like those things on Masaru's shoulders.
It's certainly an important point.
Think hard about it and make a character you're satisfied with.
Yes!
But...
This pet, Meowbarksqueaktweet...
I think Mebasqueet is good.
It's gross, but cute!
I like it, too!
I like how it's not trying too hard to be cute.
Okay, so going with that...
I have to get the other designs down pat.
There's a lot to do.
Like the grandpa, and the heroine, for example.
All right, I understand.
You concentrate on the art.
The next meeting will just be Takagi and I.
Okay.
All right, let's move on to the storyboard now.
Yes.
This failed invention, the Zero-G backpack that won't get heavy no matter how many textbooks you put in it...
Can we add another similar one?
Another one?
How about navigation shoes that automatically walk you to school, even when you're asleep?
And he ends up not being able to stop?
That's great!
In fact, it might be good if all the inventions are failures.
I see! Let's go with that!
This is looking good.
Maybe I was too quick to judge when I said Shujin can't do jokes.
How's Aoki Kou's storyboard?
This'll probably please the higher-ups.
But I'm surprised at how easily you got her to draw underwear.
She's still resistant on that point, though.
Maybe it's better to have her do the characters and have Nakai do the backgrounds and underwear?
I thought about that too, but I want to sell it with the tag written by a beautiful female author.
Nobody's going to see her face.
Judging by this storyboard, she's not showing the underwear in a way that will get guys excited.
Yes, I know.
She said she'd do it alone, though.
Speaking of which, do you know any assistants who're good at that?
Yeah, I know someone who's just perfect.
Should I introduce you?
Really?
Thank you!
Takagi?
Hello?
It's Yamahisa.
Thanks for your hard work.
The storyboard is great, but I have a suggestion for you.
A suggestion?
I've found an assistant who's good at drawing girls' underwear.
Wha
If you're still opposed to drawing underwear,
why not leave it to them?
Is it a man? Or a woman?
A man.
I refuse.
I can't trust men.
Especially one with that as his specialty.
Huh?
I'm almost done with the second chapter's storyboard...
But this teacher, Noa...
Takagi!
Hello.
Sorry for calling so late.
But I really wanted to hear your opinion on this.
Okay.
You said you were thinking about becoming a teacher someday...
Can I ask you more about that?
We promised to help each other out.
Ask away.
Thanks.
Um... if you became an elementary school teacher, and a fifth grader flipped up your skirt,
what would you do?
My skirt?
I'd be angry, of course.
I might call his parents.
You'd go that far?
That kind of behavior can't be permitted.
What if he became a molester when he grew up?
I-I see.
That's very informative.
Thank you!
Huh? Is that all?
Yeah.
Well, I'll get going now.
I wanted to talk with him a bit longer.
I was just saying I didn't trust men, but why is it okay to talk to Takagi...
No, I can trust him.
Do I like...
No!
We're just helping each other out as fellow manga authors.
Besides, he has a girlfriend.
That reminds me, Iwase also likes him...
Another gag manga, huh?
How about it, Miura?
From this list, it looks like Aoki Kou and Ashirogi will go head-to-head in the upcoming NEXT.
That's some confidence you have there.
Aoki's art will never compare with Ashirogi Muto's.
You're having them draw a gag manga, right?
Yeah.
I don't think they're suited for it, though.
We won't know until we try!
We already know.
They spent so much time on TEN and only got 10th place!
This time, I'm 99.9 sure we'll take the top ranking!
That's not 100.
Hey, let's bet on it.
Who can take the top rankingAoki Kou or Ashirogi?
Sounds good to me!
By the way, Business Boy Kenichi hasn't been doing so hot lately, has it?
Enough out of you!
Is that the way you speak to your superiors?!
Cut it out, both of you!
Sorry.
Damn! I don't want to lose to him.
July
Hey, Miyoshi hasn't come around lately.
Is she sick or something?
Dunno.
Dunno? Haven't you talked to her at all?
I wonder if she's being considerate because I'm busy.
Is she really sick?
It's Takagi.
Hey. You haven't dropped by lately.
What's up?
What's up?
Y-You met up with Iwase, didn't you?
Y-Yeah, but...
So you did, after all.
Well, I did, but...
What's with the but?! I don't want to hear your excuses!
What?
She knows I met with Iwase.
How did she find out?
You just left Iwase's novel lying around!
Oh, right!
Here it is.
But this is under her pen name.
Even if she happened to know it was Iwase's work, she wouldn't know we met.
You should explain it to her...
Forget it.
She said she didn't want to hear excuses.
Miura will be here soon, so let's concentrate on the manga.
Having Tanto and the grandpa switch bodies is pretty funny.
Isn't it too cliched?
It's fine, kids like that kind of stuff.
Well then, that's it for today.
Thank you.
I'll let you take a look at this.
A list of the authors in the upcoming NEXT.
See you.
Aoki Kou will be our number one rival.
There's another gag manga in there.
I'm concerned about that, too.
Takagi, Mashiro.
We're taking first place for sure!
Take it.
And then, serialization!
I feel like we saw another side of him.
It's proof he's taking this seriously.
We have to work hard, too!
He looks like a main character.
Yeah!
But are we gonna make the deadline?
Not having Miyoshi here hurts.
Don't talk about that now!
Okay, I've got the manuscript.
But are you two okay?
Yeah...
Take care of yourselves.
Well, I'll take this to print.
Please do.
I remember when Money and Intelligence was in this.
But this excitement is different from back then.
It's okay. We definitely won over the other gag manga.
Shujin?
Read Aoki's.
Okay.
Mame Souichirou, 15 years old.
Starting today, he's a freshman at Aoba Academy.
The first spring winds...
Unlike hideout door, it's got the light feel of a shounen magazine.
Yeah, yeah, just keep reading!
Let's not see each other until our dreams come true.
Okay.
Until then, let's encourage each other with email.
This is exactly like me and Azuki!
Yeah, I didn't think she'd put what I told her into her manga word-for-word.
You shouldn't have even told her!
Will Miyoshi realize that Aoki and I talked by reading this?
I dunno.
Have you even talked to her since then?
I'm not gonna be the one to call her.
I'll wait for her to call and apologize.
When our dreams come true, please marry me!
This is really bad!
This goes on sale in two weeks!
We have until then to set things straight!
How? It's impossible! She was so mad about Iwase!
Is there something else?
I love you! I love you!
This P.E. teacher...
It's gotta be Nakai...
She put stuff about herself into her plot...
But it feels like she just ripped off the stuff about me.
Well, I got a bunch of ideas from her, too.
Anyway, do something about Miyoshi.
Why is Ashirogi writing a gag manga?
But this is good.
Because you like cliched jokes.
Yep. That's why I'm the assistant for KIYOSHI.
Do you think it can get first place?
I dunno.
What about Aoki's?
I don't get romances.
That's why it's what's inside that counts.
But you're pretty, Katou, so you're all set.
Oh you, Nakai.
It's been a while, Fukuda.
Nakai, did you read NEXT?
Yeah, just a little while ago.
I was surprised Aoki drew girls' underwear.
I got a bit excited just knowing it was her who drew it.
Is that all?
Yeah.
I wonder if Ashirogi can take that to serialization.
This isn't about that.
I want to hear your thoughts on Miss Aoki's Time of Blue Leaves!
I don't have any, really...
I'm working right now, but maybe later...
Nakai, how long are you going to stay an assistant?
I heard you were hired for temp help, but you're staying there even though he's found another assistant.
They can't find a good story for me.
Why not try looking for one or writing one yourself?
Do you plan on being an assistant for the rest of your life?!
I have my own way of doing things.
Assisting is fun, too.
Miss Aoki would be wasted on you, then!
That's right. Aoki and I aren't a good match.
That's why I've found a new love.
What's with that?
They're all good-for-nothings!
Ashirogi is going along with their editor and doing a gag manga!
I don't know what's going on, but shouldn't you be more worried about KIYOSHI right now?
We're in this mess because you said it would be good to add mixed martial arts!
You went along with it!
Okay, I've got the manuscript.
Good work.
Oh, what did you think of NEXT?
Ashirogi is amazing.
It was pretty much a model gag manga.
The art matched the story, too.
They are both skilled.
But I think they're more suited for story manga.
I hope they don't become a jack of all trades, but a master of none.
By the way, Hiramaru.
Did you read NEXT?
I'm not interested.
I've got enough of my own problems.
Would you please just let me rest for a week?
This time I'm really, truly at my limit!
I thought you'd say that, so I brought this.
She's a young, 22 year old beauty.
Mr. Yoshida!
I'm glad I trusted in you!
From the bottom of my heart
I'll hold on to it for now.
What? No way...
Why?
I'll give it to you after you finish your current manuscript.
R-Right!
As for letting you meet this young babe...
Let's see... I'll arrange a meeting after three more manuscripts.
Wh-What?!
Y-You're too cruel...
Mr. Yoshida!
That's not it, Hiramaru!
Listen carefully.
If you see this picture, you'll definitely like her.
More than Aoki Kou.
Really?
Yeah.
But even if a manga artist falls in love, he mustn't drown in that love.
Actually, I knew a manga artist who began a passionate romance,
wore himself out over it, and was eventually put on hiatus after he stopped drawing.
Love and a hiatus...
It seems too good to be true.
Don't be stupid!
Think about it.
If Otters is canceled,
you'll only be left with debt, and this young beauty will leave you.
That's reality.
In order to love, you have to finish up your manuscripts
and steadily build up your wealth.
I see...
Won't you let me take care of it?
Both your love and work schedules.
Don't laugh, assistant.
Sorry...
Okay!
If I finish this, I'll get the picture!
Three more, and we'll go out to eat!
This is the schedule of my love!
Right. Go Hiramaru!
Your future is bright.
Can they really get first place?
We won't receive the results for another month, you know.
I want to get first place no matter what!
You're too obsessed with first place.
It's a gag manga, so as long as it gets enough votes, it'll be serialized.
Hattori.
Wanna get some coffee?
What do you think of Ashirogi's gag manga?
What do I think?
Nizuma said he hopes they don't become a jack of all trades, but master of none.
He said that, huh?
He has good insight.
Do you also think they'd do better with story manga?
I've been watching Ashirogi since they first submitted a manuscript.
Personally, I think they do best with story mangaand dark ones, at that.
But Tanto is well done.
But why are you so interested in them, Yuujirou?
Because Niizuma views them as his number one rival.
He hasn't been as psyched up since TRAP ended.
I also panicked a few times and thought they were going to overtake him.
But I wonder why such a big gap opened between them?
Was it just luck?
It's talent.
Their talent has brought them this far.
But Ashirogi Muto are still only 18.
They'll use their talent to rise to the top, no matter what!
I have to start thinking of more jokes for when we get serialized.
I have to read manga that could be used as reference.
Huh? Azuki?!
Maybe it's about Miyoshi.
Hello?
Hi.
Takagi?
Hi.
Kaya's at my house right now.
She says Miyoshi's at her place.
Kaya's upset that you and Iwase met.
That's a misunderstanding
Then you'd better explain it to her.
You're done with your manga, right?
Well, I don't want to make excuses...
and I don't think it's really necessary if she trusts me.
Fine. I'll call Mashiro.
Mashiro's right here...
Then put him on.
She told me to put you on.
Hello?
Mashiro?
It's been a while.
Yeah.
What's going on? Tell me.
Um, Takagi and Iwase met by coincidence...
Then what was with that letter?
Letter?
She said it was in the book.
In the book?
Hold on a minute.
Can I tell her about Aoki?
No, you can't!
Then I can't explain it!
Sorry, I can't explain Takagi's intentions in detail,
but he didn't arrange to meet Iwase...
It was like a coincidence, and he didn't know about the letter in the book...
Mashiro.
Why are you hiding things from me?
Well...
It was the same with your uncle.
Huh?
My mom told me that she liked Jack, and had a romance with a man that ended only with correspondence.
I wondered why my mom watched Super Hero Legend with me when I was little.
Mashiro, my mom forbid you from telling me about her and your uncle, right?
Why did you hide it?
I didn't think it was important enough to tell you.
And that isn't related to Takagi's problem.
Really?
I think their story holds a special meaning for us.
And I think we need to be honest with each other, especially since we're apart.
Like I said, I'm not hiding anything...
Then tell me everything about Takagi's issue.
Well, that's...
I can't trust you!
What happened?
I-I think Azuki dumped me.
I've been cornered! It's sink or swim!
It's sink or swim for me, too, in a different way.
We're both in rough spots.
Monkeys and Marriage.
It's just a dream, but I want to be popular too!
