Genshiken
I woke up and as usual forgot my cell and missed the Express.
My life reflected in the train window.
I'm sure I have something that I won't lose to anyone in Japan...
I can't run fast, though.
I'm not that strongly-built.
Here I go, at my dauntless pace.
Pass away, today's sadness, raining in the sun!
Hesitation, repetition, dreaming all night, all night.
Farewell sadness, to outer space you go!
Look to the sky and shout at the top of your lungs!
At this tempo!
Right now, at this tempo!
Genshiken Right now, at this tempo!
I'd like a receipt, please.
Y-Yes sir, made out to whom?
The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture.
Visual Culture?
The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture.
Thank you very much!
Howza!
Yo.
Hi...
Where's Kohsaka?
He went home.
Oh, okay.
Ah, no wonder I can't relax.
This is the first time it's just been me and Kasukabe alone in the club room.
Why am I dwelling on that now that a year's gone by?
I should just talk about something.
I was wondering, did you see yesterday's...
That Kujiun thing?
I saw it, or rather it was shown to me.
So what'd you think?
What'd I think?
I couldn't really tell what's going on.
No, no, no, it was well on par, a masterpiece, on a godlike level even.
I mean, it's Wakada storyboards and Higashino dramatization.
There's no chance it won't be good.
Oh yeah?
Let me explain!
The anime director's most impressive...
The extraordinarily intense devotion to tempo and layout of Wakada...
Select team?
Maybe they don't really trust the studio?
The director kind of takes a hands-off approach, too.
Really.
After all, Wakada storyboards are in high demand for original pictures...
In that case it's faster for acquaintances to do it, and probably less stress.
Now I get it.
Now, it's no exaggeration to say that...
Oh yeah, the sunlight through the trees scene was pretty.
Aha, you noticed?
That's it, all right!
For real? Cool!
Right, as if!
Sorry, it's nothing.
What am I getting all delusional about?
And what the hell, do I actually want that to happen?
Great, now I'm just being a weirdo...
Talk about something, something.
That's the Love Letter from Beyond series.
Yeah, it's a masterpiece.
But, I wonder if I should share how moving this is.
That'd be nice. Leave it be.
I'm so inflexible.
I know full well that reality can't just be divided up into choices like that.
Well, I'll keep it simple.
Good manga, eh?
She's ignoring me!
No, no, even Kasukabe wouldn't do that I don't think.
Ah, volume 9!
That's an especially good part, where Toki and Shiira are finally reunited.
She's engrossed.
Well, that makes me happy in a way.
Madarame: Good manga, eh?
Whisper of the Flying God is good too. Keep quiet.
No! If I don't start doing something I'll look suspicious.
EEEk!
No, no, no! That must never happen!
I'm no one-man comedy troupe!
No way can I take this out in here!
M-Mind if I turn on the TV?
Nah.
Thank you...
Wait, why am I thanking her?
Oh, excuse me.
Do aliens use the bathroom a lot?
When visiting the planet Eldo, women especially should beware of constipation.
Say what?
I've got it! Say what?
I found the aliens' weakness!
There are actually three female aliens!
But there's always two of them...
They look the same so we didn't notice, but they constantly swap places.
You know, even Kujiun has its share of issues.
Even when it's for a gag, I don't like it when they resort to dirty jokes.
The fans eat it up, though.
Maybe the problem is that until now they've for the most part stayed true...
Get set.
I'm sorry, I slipped up.
On your marks.
Get set.
I'm sorry, that time I jumped the gun...
Well...
How should I put it?
I'm getting swept away!
Get set.
S-Should I turn it off?
It'd be best if I did, it's so noisy.
Ah, um...
Uh...
That's weird...
Oh geez.
That's funny, where'd it go?
Uh... Hmmm...
Ah man, ummm.
Uh no, it's nothing. I'm all right, that is, I wasn't trying to sneak a peek.
Really, I wasn't.
Oh, right! So that's it...
Talk about close calls.
Why did I leave?
Why am I running away after that little stunt?
Although, going back right away would be unnatural.
This is weird.
Kasukabe being around shouldn't really bother me this much.
She's far off from my usual range.
She should be the one being careful and uncomfortable in this situation.
What a joke.
I just I just need to talk to her more naturally.
Naturally.
Thirsty?
Huh?
No, I'm good.
Here, it's in a can so nothing weird got put in it.
No, that's not the issue.
There's no need, I don't want it.
Oh, yeah, all right.
Uh...
What?
That's weird, am I way off?
She must think this is awkward too, right?
Maybe she feels sorry for being rude, or that it'd be bad to just leave now.
That's it...
That must be it...
How are things?
Did something happen?
Like what?
Like with Kohsaka.
Like with Kohsaka.
Not especially.
Nothing's amiss?
The usual.
Oh, that sounded kind of iffy.
What gives!
Uh, well, it's rare to see you act this way...
It's like wow, what a surprise.
What is this, a TV interview?
No, not at all!
It's just a bit mysterious!
I'm not trying to pry at all...
Actually, I hate it when people stick their noses into other peoples' business...
Um, sorry.
Right.
Do we have the next one?
Oh, volume 10?
We sure do!
Umm, it should be around...
Here it is.
You know, Whisper of the Flying God by the same artist is good too.
I'll lend it to you if you want to read it.
No thanks.
I'm still in the middle of this one.
Quite right, that you are!
Here's volume 10.
Thank you.
Am I that unpleasant?
Am I the Andromeda Strain?
What? Hold on a second.
No girl should have something like that hanging out of her nose.
This is just too much, too manly even...
No wait, calm down! It might just be some trash or something.
Or maybe my imagination's just getting away from me!
I need to not look like I'm staring, and take another glance to make sure.
In a way, this is an awesome chance to strike up a conversation.
On second thought, wait.
Wait just a minute...
The way it's hanging, it might not be attached any longer.
How could a nose hair grow that long?
It'll fall off on its own.
Yeah, it'll fall off.
Or will it?
Even if it will, should she go out of here like that?
I'd feel bad for her if anyone else saw her like that.
It'll take another 30 minutes to finish reading that.
No, Kasukabe's no manga reader so it'll probably take 45 minutes.
If she's about to leave and it still hasn't fallen off, I guess I'll mention it.
No, if someone else from Genshiken shows up before that, forget it.
I can't tell her in front of someone else...
Hm? What's the matter?
There's something under your nose.
Huh? Where?
Here.
Eek! This is a nose hair!
You saw it! I'm so embarrassed!
Yeah, I can do this.
Just keep the mood light.
Here goes.
Leave it be.
In a game when there's only one choice, it's a real relief...
But then, when it comes to real life...
No, they don't exist!
Heroines don't have protruding nose hairs!
It's for her sake, but more importantly I can't let this continue!
If I give in to this, I lose out to something spiritually.
What spirit I don't know...
But it's okay!
This kind of thing shouldn't hurt Kasukabe that much!
Nonchalantly! Naturally! With a smile on my face...
Don't feel bad...
What's with them?
Talk about serious.
Hey, Madarame.
What do you figure they're talking about?
Heh, stupid stuff.
Did she start her period or something?
Now he's in trouble!
W-Was I right?
I am so...
What's worse, I was the only one who didn't get any chocolate that year.
All 18 of those girls hated my guts...
No, being slapped in public makes one a man.
That was a medal for me.
That'll do for now, anyway.
That's not the problem, though! I need to draw her attention to this somehow!
I've always been told I didn't have an attention span...
Hey.
Just kidding.
There's something under your nose.
Huh?
Hold still.
There, it's gone.
Thank you.
C'mon, less thinking more doing!
Yes! My extraordinary delightful face!
Sorry!
Nah, I'm okay.
I didn't only slap you just now, I let you have it.
Oh, you did?
I honestly couldn't tell.
Huh? You couldn't?
No, well, seriously.
I'm totally okay.
Oh, the trash fell off.
Huh?
It was, um, stuck under your nose.
Eh...
Uh, wait, where are you going?
Just to go look in a mirror.
Mirror? Hey, hold on...
No I'm fine, I really mean it.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
It's all cut up.
It couldn't be.
He hasn't come back.
What was that all about?
Dwelling on her...
Even though it's been a whole year...
Or in a way, maybe it's because it's been a whole year...
We took no detours or shortcuts...
Only vivid dreams extended deep into the shadows.
We aren't quite grown up.
Simple but complicated glistening like marbles.
The time we spied from there sparkled, even if nothing big happened.
What we see from the marbles in our hands now is a little different...
Where is the Holy Land for people like us?
I guess it would have to be Big Sight?
Wrong.
Then Kamiigusa in Suginami Ward, or maybe Hitotsubashi or Otowa.
Wrong.
Then, where?
The Takizawa Lounge!
Where they charge 1000 yen for a cup of coffee?
Yeah, where they say all the employees are widows!
They also say it's the most expensive in the business!
Even if you see someone you know, you don't greet them.
Those are the rules and manners!
Holy Land finalized!
