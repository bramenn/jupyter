The sports festival is coming up soon.
Sports Festival
Please be sure to have your guardian look over the information we just handed out.
Sports Festival Notice
Saikawa, what's a sports festival?
Wow, didn't you have them in your country, Kanna-san?
A sports festival is a very fun event!
There's running,
Running?
ball-tossing,
Ball-tossing?
tug-o-war,
Tug-o-war?
and lots of other events where the whole class works together!
Oh!
Mothers and fathers come watch, too.
You can eat lunch with them, as well.
Oh!
You're great at sports, so I'm sure you'll be a heroine of the day.
Then your mother will praise you!
Oh!
Work that day. Can't.
Kobayashi. Take the day off.
I can't do that.
Kanna, Miss Kobayashi's in the middle of her death march
and on the verge of facing Hades.
Give it up.
No!
Also, what is a sports festival?
You train with everyone to defeat strong opponents.
No, I don't think that's quite right.
Kobayashi, come!
Defeat Hades!
Don't be selfish.
At least I'll be sure to come for you.
No.
Why does it have to be Miss Kobayashi?
Saikawa said mothers and fathers come with us.
Lady Tohru, you're like a big sister.
Kobayashi's like a mother.
A mother? I'm not that old... Wait.
Some of my old classmates do have children already...
Miss Kobayashi, hang in there!
Well, at any rate, I can't.
Sorry, but you'll have to make do with Tohru.
Make do?
Forget it!
Ah, Kanna!
Is it that important whether a parent shows up or not?
For one thing, I'm not exactly Kanna-chan's mother anyway.
But Kanna does tend to view you as her mother.
I'm not that great though.
I never had both my parents come to a sports festival.
They were busy with work.
I understood they were supporting our family, too.
Kanna's parents basically gave her free rein.
They felt a dragon would grow up strong on its own.
They probably told her to live strong since she bears the name Kanna Kamui.
But Kanna's pulled many different pranks to try and get her parents' attention.
To the point she was banished to this world...
So I think that's why she wants you to spoil her.
Even if you say that...
Hmm...
Good morning, Kanna-san.
What's wrong?
Kobayashi won't come to the sports festival.
Wow, really?
But there's more to the sports festival than that!
It's still fun working together with everyone to be victorious!
Victorious...
Your working together sounds fishy, Saikawa-san.
Shut up! You got a problem with that?!
No, no problem. I just don't believe you.
That is basically having a problem with it!
Sports festival?
Yeah.
That date overlaps directly with our delivery date.
Well, I'm wondering if there's really any need to go in the first place.
You don't want to?
Well, I think it would be nice if I could go.
Hmm? What?
It's my first time seeing you worry about something like this.
Really?
Oh, I guess so.
Well, I think it's more a question of do you want to go, rather than can you.
If I want to go, huh?
Lalala, I'm a cute maid!
I'm home.
Kanna, are you still in a bad mood?
Would you give
Lady Tohru, perception blocking.
Huh?
Place it on me.
Oh.
I'm home.
I'll get your dinner ready.
Yeah.
Kobayashi.
Hmm?
It's all right if you don't come to the sports festival.
Huh?
It'll still be fun working together with everyone in my class.
So, good luck with your work, Kobayashi.
Oh, sure.
Good night.
It seems that Kanna went to your work today and was secretly observing you.
Hmm...
I've felt this feeling before.
Oh, right.
It's the same guilt I felt then...
Tohru.
Yes?
Starting tomorrow, I'll be getting home even later.
You mean...?
All right!
Boys Relay
Girls Relay
Thirty-five!
Thirty-six!

For
Shoot!
So close!
Okay. That's enough for today.
You're all able to jump a lot now, huh?
That's incredible.
Let's keep it up and work hard toward winning the sports festival!
Yes!
Kanna-san, let's do our best!
Okay.
You're working hard.
Yeah.
Planning to go to the sports festival?
Mhmm.
Decided you want to go?
No.
Decided I ought to go.
Want some help with your work?
Huh?
Oh, uh...
Yeah, could you?
Okay, next night drinking is on you.
Sure, sure.
Sports Festival!!
I'll be coming tomorrow.
Really?
Yeah, really.
You beat Hades?
Yeah, I did.
Kobayashi, I love you!
Whoa.
My goodness.
Kanna's still such a child.
What do they expect me to do?!
What do I do?!
I could go for both!
No, that would go over my daily limit! I can't!
But, still!
Chestnut Cream This Season Only! Sweet Potato This Season Only!
Umm, ma'am, if you could please...
I-I know!
I'll make my choice now!

Thanks for the food!
Lady Tohru, this is good.
Thank you.
Miss Kobayashi, here, ah.
Tohru, what kind of meat is this?
Tch.
Knew it.
Ah.
But this lunch really is good.
Thank you, Kanna.
Eat plenty, and give it your best today.
Yeah.
We'll turn things around after this.
What do they expect me to do?

We won because you closed the gap as much as you did.
Thanks, Saikawa.
Kanna-san!
Class 2
Entrance 43rd Oborozuka Elementary
Nice work out there, Kanna-chan.
Thanks, Kobayashi.
You worked hard out there.
Yeah. We won because everyone in our class worked hard.
But you must feel unsatisfied, not being able to go all out.
Congratulations Gold
That's fine. It's better being with everyone else.
Kobayashi.
Hmm?
Thank you for coming today.
Thank you for lunch too, Lady Tohru.
It was hardly anything at all.
Participating in a sports festival as a guardian, huh?
My life's really changed.
When did I change this much?
Still, it would be nice to let loose a little bit more today.
Congratulations Gold
Right?
How about it, Kanna? It's been a while.
You're on.
Let me in, too!
Great! Shall all three of us, then?
Mhmm.
Is that all right, Miss Kobayashi?
Well, as long as you do it somewhere where you won't bother anyone.
Lady Tohru, where should we do it?
Let's use the same place we did last time.
Good grief.
I'm itching to go!
Which should I choose?
Which should I choose?
Which should I...?
Which?
Melon Flavor Kids' Toothpaste Grape Flavor Strawberry Flavor
Why must the products of man trouble me so?
Humans are frightening!
Next Episode
I'm the maid Josie, servant of the Saikawa family.
I'm Shouta's familiar, Lucoa.
Familiar?
Yeah.
It seems we both have rather unique hobbies.
