The walls gave the people a century of peace and security.
The terror of being at their mercy
and the humiliation of being trapped became a distant memory.
Until...
The battle for humanity's survival
began the moment the Titans breached the wall.
After innumerable casualties among soldiers and civilians alike,
it was learned that some Titans were hiding among the humans.
Finally, five years after the first wall fell,
humans succeeded in capturing one of these disguised Titans: Annie Leonhart.
Nevertheless...
Hey!
Look!
A Titan?!
In the wall?!
It can't be!
Your orders, Section Commander?
Huh? What? Hold on!
Was that there just by coincidence?
Or does this mean...?
Pastor Nick?
Whatever you do...
Huh?
Beast Titan
For now, we've covered the Wall Titan with sheets.
We'll take more proper measures after sunset.
I see.
What are we supposed to make of this, Sir?
I never imagined there were Titans in the walls...
No one did.
There were only people who knew, and people who didn't.
What's the deal?!
We just fought a Titan here. Why are they keeping us in the dark?
Business as usual.
But what's scummiest of all...
Now then,
it's time for you to talk.
What is this Titan?
What is it doing inside the wall?
And... why did you people keep this a secret all this time?
I have work to do!
My church and followers have been devastated!
This is your fault! I will demand restitution!
Now let me back down!
Certainly.
Will straight down do?
Section Commander!
Stay back.
Enough of this!
Do you people know why we Scouts have shed so much blood?!
To take back our freedom from the Titans!
I was willing to sacrifice my own life for that cause!
I'm not asking you to talk, I'm ordering you. Is that clear?
And if you won't talk, I'll try the next person.
Your measly life wouldn't make up for much, anyway!
Let... go of me!
Like this? Right now?
Yes!
Fine, then. Die.
Section Commander!
Kill me and learn!
We will fulfill our duty, without fail!
So...
Deliver me... O Lord...
Just kidding. I wasn't serious.
Tell me, Pastor Nick...
Are all the walls made of Titans?
Section Commander...
Whew, I forgot how this feels.
I haven't felt this way since my first time outside the walls.
Talk about terrifying...
Hurry! Inform Commander Erwin!
Hurry!
There are Titans inside Wall Rose!
12 hours earlier
South of Wall Sina
My village isn't far south of here, you know...
My hometown is close by, too...
Damn. Why can't I go visit?
Maybe I'll sneak out at night.
They told me not to come back until I'm normal.
They told me I was too puny to be a soldier.
Was genius enough to be one, though. I was in our class' top ten.
I'm gonna go make'em eat their words.
Conny. If you're serious, I'll help.
What? How come?
Doesn't it seem strange?
We're on standby in our plain clothes,
and we're not allowed to train or wear our uniforms.
Even more suspicious...
We're inside the wall, not on the front line.
Who are we fighting?
Well, there are bears in the area.
Yeah. Bears.
Guns are enough to handle bears.
I hear thuds! They sound like footsteps!
Huh?
Get serious, Sasha.
If you're suggesting there are Titans here...
Miche?
Tomas! Take three couriers and go!
Huh?
Notify each district!
There are likely no Titans among the 104th Cadet Corps recruits!
Multiple Titans from the south!
Wall Rose has been breached!
It's the truth! I really hear footsteps!
Everyone here?
Nanaba?
Multiple Titans, 500 meters to the south.
They're coming right this way.
There's no time for you to gear up.
Take your horses and evacuate all nearby homes and settlements.
Understood?
From... the south?
Has the wall been breached?!
Get going! Lunch will have to wait, I'm afraid!
Miche.
There are nine in that swarm up ahead.
They've broken through Wall Rose.
We never managed to uncover the Titans' secrets or figure out what they are.
And now the day has come.
Humanity...
No. Not yet.
Only when a person stops fighting do they lose.
As long as we continue to fight, we are not beaten!
As soon as the Titans reach the woods,
we'll split into four teams of recruits and soldiers alike,
and then simultaneously scatter in each direction!
Avoid combat when possible and focus on getting the word out!
Is anyone familiar with this region?!
M-Me!
My town's north of here!
I know the lay of the land well!
And... so does Conny!
Conny?!
My village...
My village is to the south...
I can take you to the nearby villages. After that...
All right.
You'll guide the southern team.
Yes, Sir!
I'll come with you, Conny.
The south will be crawling with Titans. It'll be the most dangerous.
So? I was going to help you sneak there anyway, remember?
You coming, Bertholdt?
Of course I'll come.
As you may know,
today marks the new darkest day in humanity's history!
If ever humankind needed to give its all, that time is now!
The Titans have reached the woods!
Scatter!
Ride as fast as you can!
What?!
They all started sprinting!
Whoa! They're going to catch up!
Gerger!
Take charge of the southern team!
Sir?!
U-Understood.
He's using himself as bait?!
He won't survive! I'll help!
No! We can't spare anyone else!
Have faith in him!
His skill is second only to Captain Levi!
He'll make it back alive!
Information Available for Public Disclosure Little is known about the Titans inside the walls. They appear to form the walls with a material similar to the Female Titan's crystal. The leaders of the Wall Cult seem to be aware of the truth, but remain wholly unforthcoming.
Oh, Eren.
Did you get into another fight?
Those jerks started it! They made fun of me!
So, I assume Mikasa had to come to your rescue again?
Thanks.
Eren.
No matter how cruel someone is or how much you hate them,
you can't always charge at them head-on!
You're a man!
Show some restraint! You need to be there for Mikasa, too!
That's...
It fell.
You gotta be tired. Go get some sleep.
Sorry. I'm fine.
That thing's seen better days.
I'll get you a new one if I see any in our supplies.
Eren! Mikasa!
This is really bad!
The Titans! They're inside Wall Rose!
Ugh. Those damn Titans never give us a break.
Can you go?
Not like there's much choice.
It was wise to have Section Commander Miche watch the 104th.
I believe he can handle the situation.
Yes.
Let's hope so.
Four left.
No, it's time to go.
I've bought enough time.
Still...
It's different.
It looks over 17 meters tall. It's huge...
And I've never seen a Titan covered in fur before.
It's just walking around instead of coming for me.
It's definitely an Abnormal, but...
Great! You're back!
I won't need to hold out until nightfall.
It went for the horse?!
You can't be serious!
Wait.
Huh? Didn't I just say to wait?
Tell me, what is that weapon called?
That thing on your waist that flies around.
I'm certain we speak the same language.
Perhaps you're simply too frightened.
Oh, I see you use swords, too.
I guess that means you know we reside in the nape.
Ah, well, I'll just take it back with me.
Only when a person stops fighting do they lose.
As long as we continue to fight...
You can move now.
No! No!
Stop! Don't! No! No!
So you can speak.
I must say, what a clever idea.
No! No!
Stop! No!
Titans have suddenly appeared inside Wall Rose.
The recruits from the 104th Cadet Corps
scatter across the land to spread the news.
Meanwhile, Eren and the others head to their rescue.
And after returning to her hometown,
Sasha comes face-to-face with her past.
