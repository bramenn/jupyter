Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade In a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
my love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
So Aizen wasnt enough for you
You even had to hurt Hinamori this bad!
To make her grip her sword so hard that her hands bled!
Whatever are you talking about?
I told you
If you ever made Hinamori bleed, Id kill you!
That will never do.
Draw your sword in a place like this and Ill be forced to stop you.
C-Captain Ichimaru!
Stay back, Izuru
You dont want to die yet, do you?
Dont be stupid. Its not enough just to stay back.
Get lost, Kira!
Out of my sight and even farther.
If youre within ten miles of me
I cant guarantee I wont kill you by mistake!
An opening.
As expected of Toshiro Hitsugaya, Captain of Squad 10
A child prodigy of the sort that comes along
only once every few centuries.
How very dangerous
Youre serious, arent you?
Incredible!
What an amazing Spiritual Pressure.
At this rate!
Here I come!
Well, Squad 10 Captain?
How do you like being cornered?
I see
I shouldnt have underestimated you Toshiro Hitsugaya.
Or Ill end up regretting it afterwards.
No, not so fast
Because your true regret begins now!
You pushed me to it. Regret this in full!
Reign over the Frosted Sky!
Hyorinmaru!
A dragon of water and ice created from overflowing Spiritual Pressure.
Andit can even control the weather!
This is the first time I'm seeing it.
The most powerful zanpaku-to of ice and snow
wielded by Captain Hitsugaya
Hyorinmaru!
So much water! What speed!
I couldnt dodge it!
Captain!
Its over! Ichimaru!
Pierce his fleshShinso!
You sure you wanna dodge this?
Shell diethat girl.
Hinamori!
Matsumoto!
Forgive me, sir.
I was returning to my quarters as ordered,
but I sensed Hyorinmarus Spiritual Pressure and came back.
Please sheathe your sword, Captain Ichimaru.
If you do not I shall engage you from here.
Day is breaking
Only two days left.
Its true that Ichigo is improving with startling speed.
Compared with that of ordinary Soul Reapers,
his growth is hard to believe.
But that only concerns his fighting skill.
His spiritual power has not risen as high.
Okay! Warm-up exercises, finished!
Whered Yoruichi go, though?
I wanna get started soon.
Can he achieve Bankai
in only two days going like this?
Maybe I should extend the deadline?
According to the information I gathered,
after Rukia had entered the Seireitei,
her execution grace period was cut five days short to 25 days.
So after Ichigos three days of training,
the execution wouldve been the following day.
We had no time to spare.
But for good or bad,
when we came here, we were chased by a Cleaner in the Senkaimon,
and tore through the Dangai Precipice World.
That shifted the time axis in our favor
when we fell into Soul Society.
In other words, even after our three days of training,
well still have eight more days!
Its possible to extend the training!
But what do we do?
Kisuke developed that training program based on himself.
The only one ever to succeed was Kisuke himself!
Yoruichi!
Moreover, the 3-day period is what it took
for Kisuke to achieve Bankai.
And he determined that
a longer time period would be dangerous.
Yoruichi!
He said
Dont worry!
Mr. Kurosakis natural abilities are greater than mine!
So I believed him and began training Ichigo.
Hey! Yoruichi!
But theres no guarantee that Ichigos soul
can withstand the longer training period.
HEY! Yoruichi!
Come on out, I said!
Ill wait one more day
And if theres still no change in his spiritual power,
Ill just have to risk it
What did you say?
Did you not hear?
Then I shall repeat the notice.
Your date of execution has been changed once more, Ms. Rukia Kuchiki.
The execution will take place tomorrow.
If you hadnt come, Hinamori wouldve been dead.
Thanks, Matsumoto.
No
Wait, Ichimaru!
Instead of coming after me
Look after the Lieutenant of Squad 5.
He always disappears without telling me where hes going
a bad habit.
That still hasnt changed.
Gin Where are you trying to go?
That letter of Aizens
How much of it was forged?
Captain Aizen!
The power of Sokyoku that is going to be released
at Rukia Kuchikis execution
The plot to use that power to destroy Soul Society
Was that line true?
If it is true
If thats what Ichimaru is after Ill
Hell Butterfly?
Reporting to the Captains and Lieutenants.
A change has been made
concerning the execution date for prisoner Rukia Kuchiki.
The execution will take place 29 hours from now.
This ruling is final.
There will be no further changes. That is all.
Captain!
The execution and the release of Sokyokus power
If thats Ichimarus aim, I cant let this execution proceed.
Come with me, Matsumoto.
Were stopping the execution.
To all Captains and Lieutenants, reporting
a final change in the execution date of prisoner Rukia Kuchiki.
The execution will take place 29 hours from now.
I repeat. There has been a final change in the execution date
of prisoner Rukia Kuchiki.
The execution will take place 29 hours from now.
This ruling is final.
There will be no further changes.
Theres no mistake. Thats his Spiritual Pressure
He seems to be making steady progress.
But whats this sense of unease that Im feeling?
Something
I sense something ominous approaching.
I was wondering what you were doing, holed up in here.
Thats your zanpaku-tos true form?
Secretly training for Bankai? That looks like fun
Lemme train, too.
Renji!
Whatre you doing here?” Thats the look youre giving me.
Hell, no special reason. Were outta time.
So I just wanted someplace where I could concentrate on training.
Out oftime?
Whaddya mean?
Well, okay. I guess I'll tell you
They changed Rukias time of execution.
What?!
The new time is noon tomorrow!
I hate to admit it but my powers now aint good enough to save Rukia.
Thats why I came here.
Dont worry. I aint gonna mess with your training.
Ive already mastered manifesting it. Only a little more until Bankai.
Im just gonna do my own thing.
T-Tomorrow?
Buthell never reach Bankai by then.
Are you just gonna quit, Yoruichi?
Werent you the one who started me on this training?
Then dont be the first one to give up!
But Ichigo, if you cant reach Bankai by tomorrow
I told you! Dont talk about cant.”
If tomorrows the deadline
Well just finish it today!
His Spiritual Pressure!
This guy!
So tomorrow is the execution
I know Before the execution, Ill ask that Ichigo and the others
be allowed to return to the World of the Living.
I belong to the Kuchiki clan, after all. They might allow it.
The execution is tomorrow
When I heard that, I was surprised,
but strangely enough I wasnt sad.
It must be because of the dream I had last night.
That dream about the night Ill never forget.
