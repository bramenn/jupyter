Otter No. 11
Otter Human Meeting!
It's Spring...
Ahh... I want to be in love.
Rie-chan you're too straightforward.
What's wrong in being straightforward?
Don't you want to be in love, Naho?
Of course I want...
I envy Emi-chan for having a boyfriend.
Well, that's not my preference.
I hope I find a wonderful lover somewhere.
Here he is.
Are you hurt?
Hey you! Naho!
Watch where you're walking, dumb morons.
Hey.. Wait!
Oh my shoulder hurt.. It's a compound fracture.
Eeh! But we hit your left shoulder...
Compensation is 1 million... PAY IT.
I don't carry such an amount.
Don't mess with me.
Stop it.
Ha?
You prowler... Stay away from the ladies.
I'm but a normal Salaryman passing by.
LIAR!! You're wearing a strange Headdress. You're the prowler.
This is not a headdress.
I'm just a Salaryman who has an otter face.
Otter 11.
Hey what is this? Decide clearly, are you an otter or a human?
That's halfway.
Hmm... Halfway.
What's wrong in being halfway?
It's vague which to stay away from.

This world is charming because halfway people exist.
Halfway is rough on evil.

I hit a petty thing again.
Otter... The animal that smashes shells with rocks.
That beast's blood runs in my veins.
Thanks for rescuing us from danger.
Thank you.
It's OK.
And...
I don't know how to thank you.. Please accept this.
Rie-chan.. Naho-chan.. Good Morning.
Emi-chan.. Good Morning.. Lovely mood since morning!
I'm Otter Human.
Even if my face is otter.. As a human..
Clam is unacceptable!
