Yup, the Battle of Fairy Tail has been decided!
The Fantasia went great!
And everyone lived happily ever after!
But Laxus ended up being expelled...
This ain't sittin' right with me!
Speaking of which, you sure have bad luck with guys, Lucy.
We weren't speaking about that!
Why are you bringing that up now?
It's been one week since the Harvest Festival ended.
The city is finally back to its usual, calm self.
It's true that everyone was quite shocked when Laxus was expelled...
Natsu was whining about it like a little kid until yesterday.
This ain't right, Gramps!
Why'd you throw Laxus out?
The Day of the Fateful Encounter!
He's part of our family, you know?
Fightin's just part of being a family, right?
Enough of this, Natsu!
I wanna fight him again!
Next time I'll be strong enough to win against him face to face!
I said enough!
Think about the master's feelings!
Do you think he expelled Laxus because he wanted to?
But...
It's because it turned out Laxus was a Dragon Slayer like Natsu.
No... He is not a Dragon Slayer.
So...
We were all really surprised when we heard that.
According to the master,
Laxus was frail when he was a child,
so Laxus's father, Master Ivan,
embedded a lacrima that lets you use Dragon Slayer Magic in his body.
Dragon Slayer Magic lacrima?
Things like that exist?
Master said that he'd take responsibility for his grandson's actions and step down from being the master.
Everyone tried to convince him to stay, but...
Don't make Laxus's punishment any worse, please.
If Laxus found out that you quit, Master...
With a haircut signifying his repentance,
and an air of the past, it was Freed that managed to talk him out of it.
Speaking of Freed, he and the other Raijin Tribe finally opened up a little bit to everyone, I think.
Go ahead and use me as your model, I don't mind!
Don't go thinking anything strange now.
I don't mean nude, okay?
O-Oui...
Like this? Or how do you like this?
Hurry up and start painting.
Are you and Loke going out?
Are you? Are you? Are you?
He lllikes you...
Ugh...
He lllikes you!
He likes you! He likes you!
And, as usual, I'm mixed up with a bunch of weirdos.
Ever since the end of the Harvest Festival, I saw Erza being alone a lot.
Master, who exactly is he?
To think he'd have the same face as someone you know...
Sorry. I don't really know much about him.
He's quite the tight lipped one, he is.
Jellal...
So, things went like that for about a week...
But I had another big problem left!
Erza is the winner!
I knew it...
Lucy's in second?
And third place is Juvia!
Congrats!
Rent: Denied!
How about working?
Well, that'd be nice and all...
What'll I do...?
I wish I had a boyfriend...
What's with you all of a sudden?
Men... It's men!
Go without a boyfriend for a while and I start gettin' the itch, you know?
What're you all embarrassed for?
I-I'm not...
How many guys have you gone out with?
Maybe like... three?
Yup, a total lie.
Haven't you ever wanted a boyfriend?
Sure, a little...
But honestly, I don't really know...
You're so dang cute!
Listen up, everyone! Lucy's never had a boyfriend!
Worry not.
My cards have spoken.
Today you will have a fateful encounter.
A fateful encounter?
Erza, what's with the dress?
Next up is makeup! I can't stay like this!
Shooby doo bop!
That's odd. The Harvest Festival is over already, so...
Didn't you know?
A reporter for the Weekly Sorcerer is coming to do an interview here.
The Weekly Sorcerer is published every Wednesday!
With features on new magic and all the hot guilds,
plus photo spreads of beautiful female wizards,
it's the magazine about magic!
What?! The Sorce' is coming?
He said he was writing a special feature on Fairy Tail.
Interview... Special Feature...
Reporter...
Fateful encounter?
Oh my god!
A magazine reporter is coming...
My cuteness will knock him right out.
Ms. Lucy... Please, allow me to photograph your cute smile...
Finally, I'll be in a photo spread!
And that reporter is my fateful encounter!
Ms. Lucy, I want to continue this interview... forever.
And what's more...
If I can get a fee from doing the interview,
I might be able to pay my rent!
This is like killing two birds with one stone!
Totally...
I can do this! I can totally do this!
Natsu, Lucy's broke.
Maybe she ate something that went bad.
Or maybe she's snapped under the pressure of having to pay her rent.
I can't stay like this!
Snip, snip...
Snip.
Perfect-ebi.
You think?
It's not to your taste-ebi?
It's just... Maybe something a bit more cutting edge?
How can I put it?
Basically, you don't like it-ebi.
Well, it's not that...
I will go on a journey to train-ebi...
That's not it, okay?
How about I go to a bookstore and buy a hairstyle and makeup magazine?
Then I'll ask you again!
Ebi...
A fateful encounter, huh?
If I pick a book this way we'll end up touching the same book...
Or something like that.
So where's the development I've been promised, huh?
Go ahead.
No... You can have it.
But...
What?!
Fateful Encounter!
I don't need it!
Here!
Hey!
Now that was a shock!
I can't believe my fateful encounter would be with someone out of the blue like that!
No! I can't go using up my luck in a place like this!
Would you wait up?
Do you live in this city?
Yes.
I was wondering... Could you show me around?
W-Why me?
I'm writing a novel while traveling around.
A novel?
I use all the things I see in the cities I visit as sources for my novel.
Well, that's really admirable.
All those memories will make that pen fly!
Wait, are you also a writer?
Oh... Well, maybe just a little.
I see.
Oh, yeah. That book from before.
I'll give it to you as a present.
So... Would you take me around for a day?
Sorry... I'm really busy today.
I see... That's a shame.
I'm sorry!
It couldn't be...
This can't be my fateful encounter...
Shoot!
I forgot to go buy the magazine...
And came here instead of going back home...
Oh! Titania!
Holy... In the flesh!
Coool! Cool! Cool!
It's Erza herself, right here before me!
Coool!
Cool...
Who's this high-strung weirdo?
That's Mr. Jason, from the Weekly Sorcerer.
Isn't this just the way I usually am?
And after I went and got all dressed up...
No problem!
I want to capture you as you are naturally!
Coool... Cool! Cool!
My fated person? Probably not...
Anyway, no way I'm going to let my chance at getting a photo spread slip by!
Very cute!
My name is Lucy!
Erza there is my friend, see!
Would you answer a few questions?
I don't mind.
Ignored!
How many different requips are there you can do?
Over 100.
Coool!
Which one is your favorite?
Maybe the bunny girl?
Bunny?
Those ears are really cute.
Coool!
What're your favorite foods?
I can't do without cheesecake or souffle.
I knew it! Nobody knows who the heck I am!
I don't wanna hear you laughing about it!
Happy!
Why are you blue?
Because I am a cat.
I suck!
*stare*
Dang...
He's totally not my type.
What'll I do if this is my fateful encounter?
It's Gray!
Gray is here, in the flesh!
Who are you?
He's that magazine reporter.
Could it be... Are you...Juvia?
Coool!
Gray, why do you take off your clothes so quickly?
I do not!
Stop callin' people perverts!
Gray-sama, your pants!
It's kind of hot in here...
I might have to strip down myself...
So you're the reporter?!
Natsu! Natsu, the Salamander!
You're the one I wanted to meet most of all!
Cool!
Take it down a notch!
Hey, hey! You're always writin' nasty things about me!
Yes!
Like about the stuff I destroyed, or the stuff I destroyed, or the stuff I destroyed...
Cool! Cool! Cool!
Whoa! It's really you!
This is radical, to the max!
Can I shake your hand?
Shut up!
Coool!
Whoa, he's just too cool...
Truly a hero!
I've never seen such a cool handshake before.
What a pro.
Elfman, what is being a man to you?
And his answer... Being a Man!
So coool!
Team Shadow Gear, is it true you're in a love triangle?
And their answer... No comment.
Dang, this rocks!
Cana, do a photo shoot this time, okay?
Whatever! Have a seat and drink up!
I don't care how desperate I am, this ain't happening.
Master, what are your aspirations for the guild?
Um... To be devoted every day in our hearts to love and justice!
I smell a lie!
The Raijin Tribe has been dissolved?
No.
No way in hell!
We'll work hard to make up for Laxus!
You've had a makeover!
I'm aiming to win the next Miss Fairy Tail Contest!
I haven't heard from you two in a while!
Well, haven't you grown!
Go easy on us, got it?
Of course!
Hey, hey!
He's not paying any attention to me at all!
I have no other choice...
It's embarrassing, but it's my only option!
Attention, everyone!
I'm a cute li'l bunny!
I'll be the one to sing!
Shooby doo bop!
Gajeel?!
Not you again!
He's here!
Iron Gajeel!
Coool!
In this world, where you look like a fool for doin' what's right...
You always looked like a fool, you know?
In other words, it's right to be a fool.
So, partner... Can you hear me?
This is a song from my soul...
It's like lightning up my spine that never stops!
Shut up, Gajeel!
Why, you...
Enough with you singin' your crappy songs!
I got business with him!
I haven't sung anything yet!
Let me sing, you bastard Salamander!
Take this, you!
Come on, you two... We're in the middle of an interview.
It's a super battle between two Dragon Slayers unfolding before my very eyes!
The photo spread for this issue is gonna be a detailed analysis of it, definitely!
Cool...
Cool...
Please, look this way.
That's it!
A hands on report... Hands on...
Cool...
What a pro.
Oh, for Pete's sake!
I'll show you around town, as a fellow author.
Well, it's not really a novel yet. Just an unhatched idea.
Then, same as me!
What're you making such a freaky face for?
Scary.
It's the same face I always have!
Let's go on a job!
We have to get to the client's house by tomorrow morning,
so we'll take a night train.
Right now?
I can't.
Huh? But you're always complaining you don't have any money.
I can't today.
Because...
Would you like to get something to eat tonight around 9?
I'd like to talk with you some more.
I've got a date!
Oh...
Aye...
Hey! You don't have to be that depressed!
What's with them?
After Mr. Jason left,
they were all excited about going on a job with you, Lucy.
Huh? Why?
They said they found a job that'd be perfect for you, although it's not much.
I guess Lucy really isn't coming...
I knew she wouldn't show...
And yet, here I am.
Thanks for waiting!
Lucy!
I thought you had a date?
Anyway, what's this cheap job that's perfect for me?
It's 70,000 jewel, exactly your rent!
Your rent is 70,000 jewel, right?
This could last you for three months!
Natsu, it'll last one month. Don't you know what exactly means?
Then, what about your portions?
Without your house, where will we weight train?
Aye!
What's that supposed to mean?
Thanks.
I'm glad I came.
In the end, what's most important to me are my friends at Fairy Tail.
I guess he wasn't my fated person after all...
I came in her place...
Lucy's such a helpless romantic... This takes an experienced woman.
She's totally my type!
Again?
As usual...
It's only a little bit further.
So hang in there? Okay?
You can do it!
Just as my cards foretold...
Today you will have a fateful encounter...
Juvia's acting weird, don't you think?
Really? I think everyone else in the guild is being strange.
It's just the usual fighting, right?
I've got a sense that there's something different about it.
Anyway, let's mix it up ourselves!
Are you even listening to me?
Next time: Special Request. Watch out for the guy you like!
Okay! I'll take on Lucy first!
She seems to be avoiding you...
Something isn't right...
I wonder what I did?
