Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Ouch! Ouchy, ouch!
Gray!
Got it!
There!
Please lemme off!
You're the one who said he wanted to ride!
It'll be all right! I'll yell it out countless times.
I believe your every tomorrow will be shining.
The intersection of all people
Never giving up. And that's why we're not gonna lose!
When it seems like you'll be blown away by the headwinds,
grasp this hand, try to take a chance.
Because you're not alone anymore, got it?
Go forward, more and more!
Don't give up on your awesome dream!
That's right, don't cry!
Move on, my way!
Now, with the light shining down upon you.
Don't even think about something like giving up!
Even if you trade being hurt again for strength.
Your eyes, always looking straight ahead,
can surely see the light!
This is Akane Resort.
It's the most popular tourist spot in the Kingdom, located by the sea.
There's a giant amusement park and a five-star hotel next door.
There's a beach which will keep you coming back again and again.
And then there's the sea expanding out to the infinite horizon...
Using the tickets they received from Loke,
Natsu and the others are visiting and having some excellent time off.
Give me back my boxers!
Not on your life!
I said, Don't use Happy to cover yourself up!
Gray-sama... So bold!
The Tower of Heaven!
But today sure was fun...
Really...
Erza...
There is no such thing as freedom in this world...
A dream?
When did I fall asleep?
I really do feel more at ease while I'm in armor.
There's no help for a woman like me...
Erza!
Want to go have some fun downstairs?
Natsu and Gray are already down there.
They wanted to go win some games!
Oh, yes! They have a place like that, don't they?
In that case...
Do I look the part?
Um, maybe that's a little too flashy...
Whatever...
Let's go, Erza!
Sometimes taking a day to pamper myself... isn't such a bad thing.
17! Come on, 17!
You can do it, 17!
There's 17!
You've got to be kiddin' me!
17!
Sir, please refrain from...
But it stopped on 17 once!
It's so cruel!
17!
Crying isn't going to...
Go back to 17!
Sheesh, they're so immature.
Gray-sama...
Juvia is here.
You're that Phantom woman!
17! Come back now!
Sir, please stop.
Hold it, boy.
Casinos are places for grownups... For dandies! Get it?
Blocky!
Boy, let me tell you something.
There's only two paths that men can travel.
Huh?
Who are you?
Natsu!
Live on as a dandy...
Or stop and meet your end. Get it?
I heard that Phantom was disbanded.
Yes. Juvia is now a Free Wizard.
So I take it you want to join Fairy Tail, then?
Yes, Juvia does!
But after all that...
Well, I don't mind, but I'm not sure what the master would say.
Juvia will do anything!
I wouldn't say that so lightly if I were you.
Gray Fullbuster?
What's all the noise?
I guess the parade has started outside.
Right.
Juvia!
Why, you...
Who the hell are you?
Where is Erza?
Get it?
What?
A straight!
Awesome, Erza!
I'm really on a roll today.
Dealer change.
R-Right...
I have a feeling that I won't lose no matter who I'm up against.
Yup!
Then... why don't we play a special game?
Let's play a game where your life's on the line, Erza-neesan...
You're... Sho?
Sho, right?
It's been quite a while, Sister.
Sister?
You were... safe?
Safe?
Uh, well...
Erza...
Where is Erza?
You think I'll tell you?
I will not allow you to lay a finger on Gray-sama.
Juvia will be your opponent.
Juvia...
Danger is closing in around Erza-san.
Sure looks like it.
What? You found her already?
Oh, I see...
So I can clean up here? Understood.
Whoa, it went dark!
It's Dark Lineage Magic.
Dark Moment.
What's going on? I can't see a thing!
Natsu, where are you?
I'm here! But... where's here?
Good night, boy...
Don't give me that, you...
Natsu!
A gunshot?
What's happened?
Sho!
Huh?
Over here, Sister.
That's...
The people are in the cards!
Help me!
Intrigued?
Magic...
Yes. I can use it now too, Sister.
You... What have you...
Lucy!
Feelin' chip an' dipper?
Milliana... You can use magic too?
How's it been, Er-chan!
Let Lucy go! She's my friend!
Friend?
We were your friends too once... Isn't that right, Sister?
You were friends...?
We were, remember?
That is... until you betrayed us, Sister.
Don't abuse Erza so much, Sho.
A man who's a dandy should keep his emotions in check.
What a blockhead!
Long time no see!
You grew a pretty hot body there.
Are you... Wally?
I suppose it's not surprising you wouldn't recognize me.
Back then, when I was called Mad Dog Wally,
I was a lot more... rough around the edges.
You also use magic?
You shouldn't be surprised.
Once you get the hang of it, anyone can use magic.
Isn't that right, Erza?
Simon...
Erza, who are these people?
And why are they calling you their sister?
I'm not actually their sister.
We were all together in the past.
Together?
But haven't you been in Fairy Tail since you were really young?
It was before that.
Why are you here?
Why?
To take you back.
Release Lucy!
How about we go home, Sister?
Unless you do what we say...
Stop it, please!
Don't!
Erza!
Erza!
We've recovered our objective.
Let us return home.
You did it the right way?
I used a tranquilizer shot.
Hey, where are you taking Erza?
Give her back!
If you guys were up against Natsu or Gray they'd blow you away real quick!
Sorry, but they're the ones that got blown away.
They were overrated.
N-No...
Then they're...
As you imagine.
In another five minutes your body'll be completely bent backwards.
Speaking of which, Milliana, I have a present for you.
It's a kitty-cat!
I'm so glad!
Happy!
Milliana, bind Erza.
A kitty-cat!
Milliana, we're counting on you.
Sister...
You're coming back... to the Tower of Heaven!
I just know that Jellal will be pleased!
The Tower of Heaven...
T-They finished it?
Erza...
Erza!
Erza.
Argh, I'm gonna bust outta this thing!
All right!
Gate of the Giant Crab, I open thee!
Cancer!
Huh?
Cancer?
What? Then, Taurus!
Loke!
Come out!
I can't use magic... Is it because of this rope?
Ow! What is it now?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Wait, was that you?
Yeah, see, since I can't get out, I was trying to prick it with this paper knife.
Looks like I hit you.
I'll try it too!
We might be able to get free!
The knife from inside the card poked me?
Close-up!
Hey, I don't know why, but that means that stuff from inside the card can affect the outside!
I'm not sure.
Then does my knife look like it's sticking out?
No, it's still flat.
But if I felt pain, then its force can be felt outside!
Please! Trying cutting my rope with that knife!
Okay, I'll try.
Hurry!
Please don't rush me.
Whatever, just get on with it!
All right, they're cut!
Thanks! You saved me!
It was my pleasure.
Next, it's your turn to...
Sorry! I'll come back and save you, I promise!
Okay!
Natsu, Gray... They're fine, right?
Gray... No!
Hey, get a hold of yourself!
H-He's cold...
I-I-It'll be okay!
I'll fix you up, promise!
Please stay calm.
It's you, one of the Element 4!
Wait, Lucy!
She's not our enemy anymore.
That is correct.
Gray-sama was inside of Juvia.
I-Inside?
Not inside of you... Inside of Juvia!
Yes, that is true.
After it got dark all of a sudden, I figured I'd leave a double and see how things turned out, but...
In order for him not to be discovered by the enemy, Juvia protected Gray-sama in her Water Lock.
And thanks to your meddling, he got away!
Lucy, where's Natsu and the others?
I don't know about Natsu, but Happy and Erza have been...
Natsu!
What a creep!
Natsu!
Did something happen?
Is it normal to go shooting people in the mouth?
That hurt!
A guy could get hurt really bad!
Um, normal people would be totally KOed.
Such is the Salamander.
That damn blockhead!
I won't let him escape!
After him!
Sure, but where did they go?
He's got a nose on him that'd put animals to shame.
Blockhead!
Lord Jellal, I'm here to report that they've captured Erza and are heading here now.
However...
Why have you let that traitor live until now?
With your magical power, you should have been able to dispose of her easily.
Well, that wouldn't do.
The world would be too boring a place.
However, now that the Tower of Heaven is complete, allowing her to live would cause issues.
The time has come.
You will become a living sacrifice to our aspiration, Erza Scarlet.
Where am I?
Inside a ship, Sister.
A ship?
Yes. Inside a ship heading toward the Tower of Heaven.
Oh... So that's it.
Will you untie me?
I don't plan to resist.
I can't do that.
Because you're a traitor, Sister.
It's pointless. Milliana's tubes have the power of sealing magic.
You can't do anything about them on your own.
No matter how powerful you are, Sister.
I-I know...
Then would you at least allow me to requip into armor?
I'm afraid... to return to that tower...
Unless I'm wearing armor... the fear...
But you look good in that dress, Sister.
I didn't want to do this...
Sho...
I missed you! Really!
Sister!
Why... did you...
Jellal...
Sis, over here, hurry!
Sho, don't be so loud!
You're even louder, Wally!
Sorry, Milliana.
Erza, if we don't hurry, they'll find us.
Right.
But, if they find out...
I know... What they do to the kids that are found out...
Don't worry, there's nothing to be afraid of.
J-Jellal!
We're going to get our freedom.
Our future, and our aspirations.
Let's go, Erza!
Yeah!
Since Happy's been kidnapped, this time I'm doin' the preview all by myself!
So, calling to order the first Plan to Save Happy and Erza meeting!
The plan is simple.
Barge in through the front door and blow away the enemy!
The codename is CHARGE!
All right, let's do this!
Next time: Jellal!
Wait, Happy... Why are you...
You'll understand when you're older.
What? That doesn't make any sense.
