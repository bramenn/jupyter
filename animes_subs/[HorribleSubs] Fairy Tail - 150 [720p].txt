Why are you crying?
B-Because everyone is going to go away...
Mama, Papa, and my precious little sister, too...
You remembered.
Yeah...
I'm sorry. I...
Don't apologize.
I'm just happy that you remembered...
Michelle...
Yeesh!
This thing should be totally destroyed by now...
Warren, what's going on?
Half of those chains are still intact!
Hurry, everyone!
Oh, no! This is taking too long!
But all we can do is cut through them one at a time!
Come on, to the next one!
Just a little more!
Just a little more and my father's will can be carried out!
No! Princess! Wake up!
Natsu! At this rate, Lucy will...
Dammit!
I ain't gonna let you vanish!
Hang in there, Lucy!
You can stand, can't you?
Michelle is...
Yeah.
But if you're a Man, you cry only after you do what needs to be done!
I know!
Wake up!
They're cutting through the chains, so why...?!
We won't be in time like this!
Anyway, we're going to defeat the Six Generals!
I'll back you up, Natsu-nii!
Alright!
Klodoa...
Leave this to me. I'm not lettin' anybody get in our way!
You guys snap that stick in half!
I'm gonna knock the sneer right off this one's face!
Let's go, Romeo!
Yeah! I'm fired up!
Lucy and Michelle!
Damn you, Titania...
Why didn't you finish me off?
I can hear you... Who's there?
Your flames will never burn me.
In the end, your magic will run out.
Oh, is that right?
And yet, you're totally on the defensive. I got you shakin' in your boots!
Say what you like.
Loathe me. But also fear and respect me.
I received my power by making a huge sacrifice.
I'm as powerful as my father now!
Sacrifice?
Become a resident of the World of Nil, Salamander!
Genesis Zero!
I cast open the Gate of Wraithwail!
Travelers of nothingness,
devour that man's soul, his memories, his very existence!
Cease to exist, in the name of Zero!
Natsu!
Natsu-nii!
Fitting for two friends.
You're caught in a world of darkness,
while the little girl is trapped in time without an exit.
Lucy...
Do you like it, Lucy?
Yeah! It's the best birthday present ever!
I'm gonna make this girl my little sister!
Good! Be friends with her.
What should I call her? I know! Maybe Gonzales?
Oh, I think you should use a cuter name...
I had so much fun then.
In that big mansion... It was like a castle.
Nee-san, you made all kinds of clothes for me out of paper and flowers.
We went everywhere together. And we smiled wherever we went...
But...
I took it out on everyone and everything. I think I made everyone really worry about me...
All I could do was watch...
It was hard not being able to do anything...
Whenever I looked at you, I was reminded of Mama, and that became painful...
That's right. You stopped talking to me altogether.
Eventually, I...
I see... I left you behind.
But you waited all that time for me to come back, didn't you?
I'm sorry. She didn't mean to abandon you.
It's just that she's so sad now after losing her mother,
she can't bear to see you or anything, really...
I don't know how to talk to my daughter these days.
Someday...
I waited for years after that.
The once lively mansion was now deathly quiet.
Suddenly, everyone was gone.
In the end, the person who came for me wasn't you, Nee-san.
I was given life, as Imitatia,
and did as I was told, pretending to be Michelle Lobster.
My mission was to retrieve the Infinity Clock.
Before, you said you helped my father with his work...
That's true.
It was difficult using Uncle like that,
but I wanted to go back...
I just wanted to go back to those days...
That's all I felt...
I heard a lot had happened between you and Uncle...
But...
Families are a mystery...
No matter what happens, their feelings always keep them connected.
I'm sure she's alive somewhere...
I know she'll come back, so I want you to find her and give that to her...
Alright?
Uncle...
But magic is a mysterious and marvelous thing, isn't it?
Next time for sure,
I hope you can become her little sister...
I'm sorry, Michelle. It must've been so hard on you...
You don't have to cry, Nee-san. It's okay.
After all, you can hear them, can't you?
The voices of the people who love you...
Everyone!
I can hear them! I can see them!
Hold on, Lucy!
Faster! We have to go faster!
Alright, on to the next one!
What happened with the rest of the Six Generals?!
Warren! What's the status of Natsu and the others?!
Dammit, what's going on?! I've lost contact with Natsu!
What's going on?!
Natsu's disappeared!
The brat's existence was devoured in the darkness and wiped out!
Wait for me, Lucy! I'm on my way!
Natsu!
It's no good... I'm losing consciousness...
Something... I have to do something!
Struggle as he might, there's no way he can get out of there.
Goodbye, Dragon Wizard.
You... can go to hell!
You make Lucy and Michelle cry...
I can't keep crying forever...
Apologize to Michelle! Give Natsu back!
What's happening?!
It's blinding!
Was that...
Lucy's voice!
What is this?
The R-system?!
No... It's... Real Nightmare!
Oh, no! The girl...
With just one engraved seal left,
it must be impossible to have complete control over the Infinity Castle!
I was careless...
I heard you, Lucy!
What's going on?!
It's Lucy! She used the Infinity Clock to sic Real Nightmare on him!
Sacrifice, you say? My ass!
They say magic is in the heart.
The more feelings you throw away, the more power you can attain.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I literally never dreamed this could happen!
To think the girl would be able to take over the Infinity Castle?! So, toodles!
It escaped!
And you call yourself a Man?!
It's a stick.
When you think you'll be able to meet someone one day, you can't stop thinking about them!
There's nothing more painful than the sacrifice
of cutting out that feeling, that possibility yourself!
I get it...
So what are you sayin' you sacrificed?
The future... A future in which I'm reunited with my father...
Is he saying that in exchange for power,
he made something that could happen into something that's not going to happen?
That's a front-loading way of looking backwards. He must be sharp...
What the hell is that? Now you lost me.
If you wanna see your dad, go an' see him already!
You people caused a rift between me and my father.
Surely you haven't forgotten?
Repaying kindness with resentment? But that's no reason to make Lucy cry!
You got a roundabout way of doin' things.
You sacrificed the future?
Talkin' big about things that ain't even happened yet...
That pisses me off!
Warren!
What is it?!
Well, we went over a lot of things and...
Actually, we discovered something that we had to tell you about right away, actually!
W-What?! Say that one more time!
Impossible! He's overpowering me?!
I can understand how you're thinkin' about your dad,
but you don't gain anything from the power of feelings by tossin' them away!
It's somethin' that's engraved in you somewhere and you gain from that!
Wrong! Because you throw them away, because you lose them, their importance shines!
Why, you...!
You're warped every which way!
The way you look at things, the way you feel, it's twisted!
That's why the past, the future, even your own heart,
you can't face any of it head on!
You...
You say I'm not facing my father?!
Lucy did it to her father, Michelle did it to Lucy...
They tackled each other head on!
You've got no right to laugh at that.
Right from the start,
you lost to the power of feelings!
Father...
He beat the last one!
What about Lucy?!
No...
What should we do? We were too late!
Lucy's gone...
Why?! We made all the engraved seals get erased!
Give us Lucy back! Somebody answer me!
What? What do they mean I'm gone?!
Hey, wait! Don't tell me this is...
I've got a bad feeling about this!
What the...?!
Lucy-nee's voice!
I smell Lucy all over the place!
It's not telepathy...
Where are you, Lucy?
Has Lucy-san...
Then this huge fish castle...
No!!
This is too cruel... I've become food for Happy...
I won't eat you!
Stay calm, Lucy!
By using Real Nightmare to help Natsu, you only sped up the merging process!
What, it's my fault?!
Anyway, I finally got through!
Everyone, listen! A little while ago, I got a call from the guild.
Jean-Luc and the others found another way to save Lucy!
Jean-Luc?
The actually guy!
If the engraved seals aren't erased in time, and merging occurs,
then Lucy-sama must focus on remaining conscious and controlling Real Nightmare, actually.
We found out the one thing that can stop the Infinity Clock in this world
is the magic siphoned from the Celestial Spirit Wizard bio-links!
First, we need to break the spells that have all of them in a chrysalis-like state.
It's a simple method.
Will their sense of time be 100 years from now?
If it is, then the clock will break up into its component parts
and scatter somewhere again, apparently.
Then...
Hey, wait a second!
What'll happen to Lucy?!
We know what to do from the merging to release...
But if something goes wrong, all the parts will fly away somewhere?!
No...
Ain't there any other way?!
I'll try...
That way, a lot of people will be able to wake up from 100-year sleeps, right?
I may fly off somewhere...
That's the only risk?! I'm a Fairy Tail wizard.
I'm the daughter of Jude and Layla!
I'm Michelle's big sister! I'll do it!
Nee-san...
Michelle!
It's okay. I'm with you.
Yeah!
You're terribly wounded... If there's anything I can do...
Don't you touch me...
Tell me... Are you the one that called me?
I can hear it...
You?!
You...
Your eye...
I lost my sight so I could gain power.
Don't worry. Just from hearing voices, I...
What's your name?
Erik.
Erik...
Cobra of the new Oracion Seis, I presume?
We've already taken your comrades into custody, so why don't you come quietly?
The Council, huh?
Wait! This man is...
This man is...
What the...?!
You're going to resist?
That girl doesn't seem to be a wizard...
It can't be helped. Anyone who conspires with the Six Generals has to be arrested.
Alright, alright...
You go.
But...
Wait! It was you, wasn't it?! You're the one who called out to me!
Hey!
I don't know what you're talking about...
Who's that girl?
A comrade of yours?
No. Never saw her before.
Sounds like she was just wandering around here looking for her friend.
I see. Good.
You're giving up awfully easy.
Yeah, well...
But you know...
Friends are good things to have.
Just knowing that you have one has a calming effect.
Erik... You called me, didn't you?
Did you hear my voice...?
I finally heard your voice...
Men!
I'm glad you're alright!
W-Where are we?! On top of an octopus?!
Don't panic! We're joined together with Kanaloa-kun by the parfum of friendship.
I see. We're on the same side...
Listen, Natsu...
Lucy... Where's Lucy?!
Calm down, Natsu!
Warren and the others are looking for her right now.
How can I calm down?!
Lucy's scent! I'm sure of it! Go over that way, octopus!
Kanaloa-kun, if you would!
Sheesh, after all of my preparations, it turned out like this!
I shouldn't have turned the Six Generals over to that kid!
Now I'll just have to become Brain III and assemble the next Six Generals...
Huh?! A clock hand?!
You're not getting away. We'll sleep for eternity together.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop it!!
When I came to,
the Infinity Castle and Oracion Seis...
Our journey began with the hand of a clock...
The events surrounding the Key of the Starry Heavens...
After that, my room seemed empty.
It felt like it suddenly became very quiet.
But I'm not lonely.
I'm fine. So don't worry about me, okay?
Oh, one more thing...
Father, Mama...
Thank you for my beautiful little sister.
Alright! I kicked Brain II's ass!
Everyone got a piece of the action, huh?
Fairy Tail really is the strongest guild around!
The strongest guild, huh?
Say, Natsu, during the seven years that we were on Tenroujima,
I heard a guild called Fiore's Strongest appeared.
What's that?! Who the hell are they?!
Next time: Sabertooth!
Let's beat'em and take our strongest title back!
Boy, all you ever think about are showdowns!
