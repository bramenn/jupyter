Milika-san is living in my yard.
She declared that she's going to become my third girlfriend.
She weathers the cold, the bugs, and the stench of her own sweat,
resolved to stay until I fall for her.
I have to do something in order to protect my two-timing life.
Saki-chan, Minase-san...
I'm sorry for worrying you.
Hang in there.
I'll make sure Milika-san gives up!
She's completely gotten into tent life.
M-Milika's got tenacity.
I have to do something about her.
Oh, Naoya! Want some meat?
Milika-san...
Please, go home.
I told you, I won't be satisfied until I make you fall for me!
That's exactly the problem!
I'm already a two-timer.
I can't possibly become a three-timer!
Not as a human being!
Not that two-timing is all right, either!
Please understand.
I can't return your feelings.
Shut up!
I can't go home after being rejected by someone like you.
Please take down your tent!
No way!
I have my pride, too!
Lay as much as a finger on my tent...
And I'll throw red-hot coals at you.
Hiss!
N-Naoya-kun, we should retreat.

Tsun Is Dere
What a stubborn woman.
It's all right.
I'll make sure she leaves soon.
U-Um...
Maybe you don't need to force her.
We could convince her over time.
Minase-san...
True.
Who knows what she might do if we push her too much, with the way she is?
You think so too, right?
Yeah.
We'll take care of her slowly and surely.
We will.
Got it, Naoya?
Y-Yeah...
Milika-san's leaving.
Probably to use the restroom.
The only one around here is at the convenience store.
It's our chance!
Hello?
I'd like an immediate pickup of some unwanted goods!
Yes.
A tent, sleeping bag, and miscellaneous camping gear.
Naoya-kun...
Were you listening to us?
The address is...
That's too aggressive!
Why are you stopping me?
Could it be, Saki-chan...
You're okay with me dating three girls?!
Of course not!
Then we have to hurry!
Give me back my phone!
H-How does that work?!
Naoya-kun, calm down a little.
But...
I'm dating two girls!
We know that.
What are you talking about?
Don't you worry that if Milika-san stays for too long, I might fall in love with her?
W-Well...
B-But when she said she'd be your girlfriend, you said no.
I'm just a two-timing asshole, remember?!
Who says that about themselves?!
If I were in your shoes, I'd be worried that I might fall for Milika-san.
W-Well, I guess...
In general, someone in my shoes...
might be, a little.
A little?!
I'd be 80 worried that you'd be dating three girls.
Right?!
So we need to hurry!
Saki-chan, your phone!
Relax!
That's only in general!
S-Saki-chan...
Exactly.
It's only been a short while since we started living together,
but we've seen your effort and how serious you are.
Besides, you aren't even interested in liking her, are you?
Of course not.
But...
Then I'm not worried.
Minase-san...
Yeah.
I trust you that much.
Saki-chan...
Thanks.
I'm so glad you're my girlfriends.
D-Don't mind it.
So let's take our time.
But I...
I don't have the confidence to say I definitely won't fall for her!
Yoink.
What the hell is that?!
But I...
I decided I'd cherish you forever.
And yet I fell in love with Minase-san.
I'm a weak-willed loser.
I can't ever let myself forget that.
I have to keep that in mind when I act.
Milika-san's cute and tough.
She works hard on her videos, and she gets results.
I think she's amazing.
It's really pathetic, but if she stuck around, I might see more in her...
and even fall in love with her.
So even if she hates me or gets angry at me...
I know I'm pathetic...
I know I'm pathetic, but I want to make an effort to love only you two.
Naoya...
S-Saki-san!
You can't get any more pathetic.
But I'm glad you told me before you fell for her!
Saki-chan...
Damn it! Let's drive her out.
If she gets angry at you, she can get angry at me, too.
You two...
Thanks. I'll do it.
Okay!
Do it!
Dad
Girlfriend, Girlfriend
Rika, where are you?
You never told me you were sleeping somewhere else!
I'm at my friend's place.
You have a friend?
Her name's Saki!
I'm busy! Bye!
Hey, wait!
You're in deep trouble when you get back!
The pawn shop pickup says they'll be right here.
Okay.
We'll take care of the tent and stuff.
I'll hold Milika-san back.
We'll dismantle her tent and get her to go home.
I need to make sure Saki-chan and Minase-san
don't have to worry about me three-timing.
Before I start wanting to!
Seriously, please...
That's better.
Milika-san!
Naoya...
What's up?
Can we talk for a bit?
No way.
You're just going to tell me to go home or something.
I'm busy coming up with a plan to make you fall for me.
Wait...
Let's think together, then.
Are you stupid?
Damn it! It'd be the embarrassment of a lifetime
if a two-timing loser like you ends up rejecting me.
Can we talk?
O-Oh, yeah!
What did you tell your parents?
What does it matter?
Right!
Who cares about my parents?
I'm not afraid of them.
Left!
Are you hiding something?
Huh?
No, not at all. I'm not trying to buy time or anything.
You...
Look, Saki and Nagisa are being harassed by delinquents!
Huh?!
My shin...
M-Milika-san!
That's my sleeping bag!
Shit, she's already here.
What have you...
My tent and barbecue set, too!
All my stuff!
Naoya, what are you doing?
Hey...
H-How dare you?!
T-Take this down!
Sorry!
Hey, let me go!
Let me go!
Saki-chan, Minase-san, hurry! Now!
Okay.
Got it.
How dare you do this to me?
I'll mess you up so bad, you'll shit yourself!
I'll shit myself now, then!
No!
Damn it...
No!
Pervert!
I'm being raped!
W-Wait...
Somebody!
I'm being molested!
Someone, help me!
He's after my G cups!
What's going on?
A groper?
Huh?
Is that Mukai-san's son?
Is she all right?
See?
The whole neighborhood will think you're a pervert if you don't let go.
I don't care!
Wh-What?!
S-Seriously?
You're going to be an outcast your whole life!
If that worried me...
I wouldn't be two-timing!
Huh?
Two-timing?
What's going on?
Are they in an abusive relationship?
Don't go screaming that out loud!
Saki-chan, is it true?
He doesn't mean anything by it!
Just hurry up and load the truck.
Okay.
Do you have any idea...
how much that camping gear cost?!
Serves you right for messing with me!
I'll pay for it, of course.
How much do I owe you?
Don't look up my skirt!
A million yen.
Pay me one million yen!
Th-That much?!
Well? You can't pay that much, can you?
Sh-She has to be lying!
It's actually about 200,000 yen.
All right.
I'll work to make the money.
What?! It's a million yen!
But in return, you have to promise you'll stay away from me.
Naoya...
Naoya-kun...
Um...
We're done loading up.
Here's the payment.
Take it!
Hey!
You... You did it.
Wh-What's your problem?
Why would you go so far?
You're just a two-timing loser!
It's true.
I couldn't choose between the two of them.
That's why I vowed to make them both happy.
Y-You're...
I'll do anything for them!
Fine. I'll work, too.
I'll help, too.
Thanks, both of you.
Wh-What's wrong with you?
You're a two-timer.
You aren't just a loser?
Here. I wrote an IOU.
Now that we're going to pay you, you'd better stop following Naoya around.
Well..
Well? What's wrong?
Milika-san?
I-I...
I don't need this!
I'm not going home! Ever!
What?!
H-Hey!
What do you mean, you're not going home?
It's not your problem!
It's a problem for me if you stay at my place.
Shut up!
Y-You're paying me to go home and to stay away from you.
I-I don't like that.
Rika!
Crap!
Dad!
Milika's dad?
How did you find me?
I asked around at school.
What are you doing here and not at home?
Shut up!
I have my reasons.
I was staying at this kid's place.
Who is that guy?!
He isn't your boyfriend, is he?
I'm not her boyfriend.
I already have two girlfriends that I care deeply about.
What does that even mean?!
I'm a two-timer!
You didn't need to mention that!
Huh? What?
Rika, you fell in love with a two-timer, and you're crashing at his place?
It's not that I l-like him!
I-I guess I wouldn't mind trying it out if he begs, though.
I won't.
Shut up!
Hey, Nagisa-chan...
Yes?
Do you think Milika's kind of...
fallen for Naoya?
Right?
I had that feeling, too.
She definitely likes him more now, right?
It'll be bad if she actually falls for him, right?
Don't date a guy like that.
Leave me alone!
Naoya!
How am I supposed to leave you alone?!
Let's make Milika go home.
Right.
He's a two-timer! It's not right!
Um...
I have no intention of dating Milika-san.
Please leave.
Wha...
Are you saying my daughter isn't attractive?!
What an annoying dad!
She may be selfish, but I raised her the best I could as a single father.
No, she's attractive.
What?
What?!
I've only just met her, but she's got backbone and determination.
More than anything, at her age, she's already gotten 50,000 subscribers on MeTube.
Milika-san is attractive.
You didn't need to say that!
Look, her heart's skipped a beat!
But that doesn't mean I'd go out with her.
Huh? MeTube?
Wait, Milika...
Crap!
Are you...
I-Is this...
My daughter's breasts are being revealed to the whole world!
Real Name Hoshizaki Rika
You're completely showing your breasts!
This is why I've been hiding it!
I'm sorry!
Looks like we're headed for a family meeting!
Take her home, Daddy.
Th-These shameful videos!
Just a second.
I don't think that's true.
Uh, hey!
Her videos aren't just her revealing herself.
Her creativity, the ingenuity of her editing, her dedication to her audience...
She's a entertainer, through and through.
Quit commenting on everything!
You do get it...
Hey! Don't blush at that!
In any case, once we get home,
you're going to explain your sleeping somewhere else and your videos.
Good going, Daddy!
Hey, wait!
Come with me.
Stop dreaming.
Let me go!
She's so stubborn.
The videos and the whole thing with Naoya
are things that I'm doing on my own, for myself!
No one can tell me what to do!
You don't even know how much you're worrying me.
If you won't stop with your selfishness...
I won't have it!
My phone!
The guy is one thing...
But I can't have you revealing yourself to the whole world!
H-Hey... You wouldn't...
This channel and all the videos on it...
Hey!
D-Don't...
That's my only...
I'm deleting it all!
Naoya!
Are you sure you want to delete your channel? Yes No
Give that back.
Milika-san's dad,
do you have any idea how much work it takes for a high schooler
to get 50,000 subscribers?
She puts an incredible amount of effort into recording.
To an ordinary high schooler like me, she really is amazing.
I don't like where this is headed.
That may be...
But the way she bares her breasts...
What's wrong with it?
She chose to do it herself!
Sure, I caused a lot of trouble trying to get her to leave, too,
by selling her camping gear.
But deleting her videos is too much!
Naoya!
Don't do anything else!
I'll protect her now!
She's...
Y-You...
Naoya, you've gone and done it now!
What do we do about her?!
Done what?
Well...
There's something I need to think about carefully.
I'm going home for now.
So...
Dad, the next time you try to delete my channel, I'm going to disown you.
S-See you.
What's Naoya-kun going to do if Milika-san becomes serious?
Girlfriend, Girlfriend
Th-This could get ugly.

Episode 7
The Girlfriends' Challenge
A Girlfriend's Two Choices!
Do you like being the pursuer or the pursued?
Naoya's always pursuing me, so the pursued.
The pursuer, obviously.
I pursue so much, they can't run away.
How you're true to yourself is attractive, Milika-san.
Naoya!
I'm going to chase you down.
The girl's in love!
