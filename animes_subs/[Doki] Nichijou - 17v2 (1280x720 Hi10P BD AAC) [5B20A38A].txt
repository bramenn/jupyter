Hey!
( !)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
All right! I'll say it!
You are my best, best friend!
(Fly!) When I joke around a bit,
(Shine!) You joke around more in response.
(La La La) Nothing is better than this!
(Why!) Even if something bad happens,
(Fine!) I immediately forget about it!
(La La La)
Always keep it going!
Being together 24 hours a day isn't a problem.
Just like twins, or a parent and child, or clone cyborgs.
Then isn't there no reason to clear your eyes?
Those are completely, completely different issues.
(Fight!) Even when I get in a fight with you,
(Down!) even when I get really down,
(Shy!) even when I feel like I want to be alone,
before I realise it, you're right there; we'll be together even in death!
I wonder why it is.
I want to be with you.
When I'm with you,
time goes 100 times faster!
It's fun, isn't it?
It's way too fun!
As expected of my best friend!
What is it?
The synchro is amazing!
Always making an uproar,
bothering the neighbours a lot.
What time is it now?
And then yo de le hi hoo!
I don't get it at all!
So re doh si la!
It's better than I imagined, the absolute best!
Even if I say this and that, we're still friends. (Hooray!)
Amazing friendship, the absolute best!
Cha Cha La Cha La Cha Cha!
In the desert where the bright red sun descends,
there a large monster lived a carefree life.
One morning when he woke up,
he heard the sound of a caravan far away.
He suddenly cried out,
I want to see the sea! I want to love someone!
A monster has a heart, too.
Go on and leave. Get out of the desert.
Go to a land with love and the sea.
A new sun is burning,
in a land with love and the sea.

Word Of The Day
Narration: Nakai Kazuya
Mai-chan, let's go home together!
Can I stop by a fire hydrant?
Now, now, that's no place for a school girl to go!
Oh, that's right, Mai-chan.
Do you want to stop by Daiku Coffee?
They changed the system quite a bit in there,
so it may be a bit difficult for you, Mai-chan.
But I can teach you all about it.
Oh, Mai-chan...
That's...
Asymmetry.
Well, that's true and all,
but that's beyond the intended purpose or fashion!
I was just being dumb.
That's way over the top.
Mai-chan, from left to right, everything is just messed up!
But I guess that's just Mai-chan's way.
What should I do for today's menu?
I heard green onions were on sale, so maybe something with that?
But Professor doesn't like green onions.
Nano! Nano!
Nano!
Look, Nano!
I caught a crow.
Good heavens!
What are you doing?
That's dangerous!
You'll get pecked!
It's fine. Just wait a moment.
It wasn't there.
I might die.
It's not here, either.
My scarf suddenly disappeared.
Hello.
I'm a crow.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
It's a good thing this is a well-mannered crow.
That's because it's a crow.
I am honoured to receive your praise.
I wonder if it'll drink strawberry milk.
You think so?
It would be cute if it did!
A mosquito...
Unbelievable.
For it to exterminate bugs!
Well, it was the natural thing to do.
He's quite a crow.
Oh, Sakamoto-san, where's your scarf?
I can't tell what he's saying without his scarf.
I shall ask him.
I see.
I see.
It seems that he wants my scarf.
I see.
It's not yours!
Professor, did you put Sakamoto-san's scarf on the crow?
Oh my, how terrible of me.
Well, if that's so, then I feel bad for Sakamoto-san.
I'll go make another one!
That would be nice.
It's done!
Biscuit 1.
That's not a scarf at all!
By the way, Professor, what kinds of abilities does Biscuit 1 have?
That's a very good question, Crow.
He has a rocket punch.
Here we go!
Ready! Set!
Launch!
Professor, you should get on with making a scarf for Sakamoto-san.
Wait a second.
After all, there's still the left hand!
Ready! Set!
Launch!
Kill.
I'm going to kill these guys.
My, I had a wonderful day today.
I might have been too mean.
Please give this scarf back to Sakamoto-san.
Even if it was just for a short while,
I was happy to be able to speak the words of a human.
Crow...
Don't leave, Crow!
Professor!
I hope we'll be able to meet again.
Well then, I bid you good day.
See you again!
Crow!
Crow...
He took it with him!
I can't do it, Manager!
No, it's all right.
Just leave it to me.
But...
What?
You can't trust me?
That's not it...
I trust you completely, Manager.
All right... Give me a hand, then.
Well? How is it?
Yesterday, I dug a trap behind the gymnasium.
It's filled with Super Glue.
I'll lure her there with this letter and trap her.
I shall capture you today, Shinonome Nano.
She's here!
All right!
I can't believe that Sakurai Makoto was Sakurai-sensei's brother.
I should find a way to get information about Sakurai-sensei from him.
That kid...
He can play Go Soccer!?
Interesting.
Hey, Sakurai.
Yeah?
Does she have a boyfriend?
No future!
It's always like this!
I'm terrible!
I'm terrible!
Well, no, but...
Here it comes!
Oh no! This can't be!
Excuse me...
Sorry about that.
Just forget about it.
Oh, right: you play Go Soccer?
I do.
Sensei, could it be...
What are you saying?!
I'm just your senior as a Go Soccer player!
Sensei, you played Go Soccer?
Of course!
I may not look like it, but I was actually the MVP in high school!
Sensei, our Go Soccer club doesn't have an advisor.
If you become our advisor, I'd completely assist you with my sister!
Like I said, it's not like I like her or anything...
If you don't become our advisor, I'll tell my sister that you like her.
Why, you!
Well, which is it?
Will you become our advisor?
Or won't you?
Well... Being an advisor seems like a lot of work.
Hey, guys!
Listen up!
Don't move!
I've gotta go after him!
Sensei!
Takanojou-kun is stuck in a hole behind the gymnasium!
Eh!?
I need you to come immediately.
Hey, Takasaki-sensei is...
Sensei!
All right, listen closely.
All right!
Nakanojou is...
Yeah, it could be a hole in one!
Also, his hair has come off!
Draw it on.
I'll try.
Hold on!
What about that?
Hey! Tea...
I think it's more important to prevent someone from revealing another's private affairs...
Because that's what it means to be a teacher!
Takasaki-sensei!
Yes!
I won't say anything.
Also, I'm waiting for you to become our advisor!
Way to go.
Annaka, let's go!
Okay!
Let's hurry!
That's what it means to be a teacher.
It's this way!
This way?
I guess I got a little ahead of myself.
I feel bad about cutting his hair.
I guess I'll go save him.
He probably has no idea that I'm the culprit.
What?
Huh?
What is this?
Huh?
What is this?
Huh?
Something's wrong!
What is this?
I can't move!
Huh?
My hair...
What?
What, what, what?
Run away!
Help me!
My hair...
Swim, Swim,
Sharky, Sharky, Chomp!
Sharky, Sharky, Chomp!
If that happens, do this!
Chicchi is like this!
What is this?
Help me!
My hair is...
Huh?
What is going on?
Help me!
What happene -
What was that just now?
Help me!
My hair...
What, what?
Help me!
Hair...
What's going on?
Help me, please!
Geez, that was dangerous...
This is weird!
Save me!
What's going on?
My hair...
Help me!
I'm heading out now!
Today, I definitely won't respond!
It's all Mai-chan's fault.
She's always fooling around,
and I'm always responding to it!
At this rate, it'll be an endless loop of jokes and responses!
We're supposed to be pure enough to put flowers to shame!
And yet...
I can't even have a normal conversation like a high school girl.
From now on, I'm not going to respond to anything!
My resolve is harder than diamond.
Oh, Yukko, good morning.
Oh, Mai-chan, good mor -
Double glasses!
This is strong.
Unlike the other days, today is strong!
But I won't give in!
Because I will... We will change!
Mai-chan, selamat pagi!
All right, now is the time to engage in some flowery girls' talk.
Hey, Mai-chan, did you watch Muscle Elegy yesterday?
W-Which one?!
Where are my glasses?
This is some rapid-fire stupidity!
It's like she's waiting for me to respond!
No!
You must not respond, Yukko!
This is a trap!
What's wrong, Minakami?
You've got two pairs of glasses on!
Tanaka, you bastard!
He took my response!
The response that only I can make!
No, wait. It's not mine.
That wasn't my response.
Oh, right.
First period today is Language.
Yeah, I heard Nakamura, the science teacher, collapsed again.
Oh, I wonder if she's all right.
Oh, right.
First period today is Language.
No, you just said th -
That was close!
Why did she say the same thing twice?!
That was frightening!
This girl is frightening!
All right, everyone stand up.
Stand.
Bow.
Take your seed.
All right, I'll begin the lesson.
Take your seed...
What does that even mean?!
Open to page 82.
Everyone ignored it!
Would anyone like to read?
Here.
M-Mai-chan!
All right, Minakami.
Okay.
Silence surrounded the mountain as it began getting dark.
A natural calamity struck us from behind.
From the place where our journey began...
The fact that she's actually reading it means...
If she's actually reading it, then it means...
It means...
It means...
You memorised it all!?
Responding...
I'm sorry for shouting!
I'll go stand in the hall!
Yes.
It's fine this way.
This is my path,
and...
Yukko.
The truth is...
The glasses had no purpose!
Professor, that's not good.
If you don't sleep in your futon, you'll catch a cold.
Come on, Professor.
Just a bit longer.
Just a bit longer?
I've been had!
Sakamoto-san.
Sakamoto-san, you should go to your bed, too.
In the end, she'll bring it along.
I'm the three of spades!
I may be the weakest in Daifugou,
but if there's a reversion, I suddenly become the strongest!
If you're a man, you have to aim for that!
Next time on Nichijou: Episode 18.
Look forward to it!
