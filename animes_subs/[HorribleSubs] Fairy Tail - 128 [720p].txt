It is near...
It is near!
Time is etched, and then chaos descends!
That dream again?
Time is etched... and then chaos descends?
So, what about a grave?
About Lisanna's grave in the cathedral...
What should we do about it?
Are you gonna destroy it?
I dunno about that...
The church said we could do what we want with it.
I remember now... We're the ones who made it.
Do you have to bring that up now?
Well, I suppose it'd be nice to leave as a memento.
Just change the inscription, or something.
I just thought about this at the church, but isn't it about time?
For what?
Oh yeah, paying respect to the archbishop or somethin'.
I know!
It's an important festival for the church, right?
This archbishop person only comes out in front of people once every few years.
A huge number of pilgrims gather just to get a glimpse of him, even from far off countries.
You don't know anything, do you, Natsu?
Can it already!
Is that the truth?
Yesterday, at dawn, the Akaza district church erupted in a fiery explosion.
There have been more than 30 cases now.
And yet we still have no clue who is behind it.
We've analyzed a number of the destroyed churches...
Many other countries are watching us carefully at this time.
We must discover who is responsible and arrest them in all haste.
The good name of the Enforcement Corps will be tarnished at this rate.
And it will be we, the Magic Council, that will take the blame.
Make every effort.
Yes, sir.
Father's Memento.
How awful... Again?
Some kind of trouble?
It's a string of church bombings!
Sounds quite dangerous to me.
Oh, I know him! We met him during that Nirvana business...
Hasn't changed a bit in seven years...
What's wrong, Natsu-nii?
He said he was tired from working in the fields, so he's taking a nap.
Strange that serial bombings like this just pop up...
We've been out of the loop for seven years, so...
Thanks to that, my prediction powers don't seem to be working right.
I can only see vague, inconclusive things.
Really?
Yes, really.
What smell is this?
Look who's awake.
Lucy-nee, you've got a visitor!
Lucy-nee's the one over there.
Thank you so much.
Who is she?
Um...
You are Lucy Heartfilia?
Yes, that's me... And you are...?
Who... am I?
Michelle Lobster!
And?!
Someone you know?
Don't go making her cry off the bat.
I'm sorry... It's been quite a long time, so I suppose it's no surprise you don't remember.
Would you like a tissue?
What a beauty... Who is she?
See, I really don't...
Let me start over. I am Michelle Lobster.
It's been too long, Lucy-neesan!
N-Neesan?!
The shocking truth! Lucy's old man had an illegitimate daughter!
No, no... The Lobster family and the Heartfilia family are distantly related.
Oh, so you're Lucy's relative.
I see now.
But, why call her neesan?
Guess that's what they mean when they say a world of difference...
I don't really get it, but you're Lucy's daughter, then?
How'd you draw that conclusion?!
I'm just kidding, sheesh.
So wait, why are you addressing me like I'm older?
Because you are.
Wait... You clearly look older than I am.
But...
Natsu, are you following what they're saying?
So it's like, that Time Ark thing?
No...
We had our time stopped for seven years on Tenroujima,
but for everyone else time moved forward, right?
When you consider Lucy's actual age, it's not strange
for Michelle to call her neesan as if she's an older relative.
Natsu seems to be refusing to think about it.
My, my...
I finally... I finally am able to meet you!
Now, now... And by the way, what's that case?
It's...
I've come to give this... to you...
I've been searching for you forever in order to give it to you!
Stop makin' her cry! And you call yourself a Man?!
I call myself a girl!
Boy, this thing is heavy.
What's with her?
Looks like we got proof she's related to Lucy... Just as noisy...
So, what is it?
It's a memento of your father, Jude Heartfilia.
I helped Uncle Jude for a little while with his work.
And I was there when he passed away...
He asked me to pass this along to you.
Father's... last request?
He was always worried about you after you went missing.
But he said that he knew you were still alive out there, somewhere, and asked me to find you.
He passed away peacefully, as if going to sleep.
Ever since that day, I've been searching for you.
And now, I've finally met you!
With this, I can fulfill Uncle Jude's dying wish!
What's inside?
I don't know.
All I was told was to give this case to you, so...
Father...
Open'er up!
Why don't you see what's inside?
She searched like crazy for you, remember.
Why don't you let her see this thing she took all this trouble to deliver?
Sure.
Um...
What the heck?
This wrapping...
I think it's got a spell on it.
That must be what I smelled earlier.
Carla?
Is something the matter?
No... Never mind...
What is this?
Is it something that Uncle Jude valued?
Dunno... I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Gotta be a weapon!
I don't think so.
I remember now!
So, it is a weapon?
No.
Then, what is it?
Your guild seems like a fun place.
My father really is forgetful sometimes.
I can't believe he forgot to tell you about Fairy Tail!
Well, I found you were in the guild right away.
Oh, right. But we'd all disappeared.
So, you're a Celestial Wizard, Nee-sama?
I really like this job!
Lucy-chan, that's dangerous!
And Fairy Tail, too!
Sure, a lot of them lack any delicacy...
But they're all good folks, and if anything happens they band together and fight!
And they value their friends above all else.
Uncle Jude was really proud of you.
Thank you for coming to see me, Michelle.
Ta-da! This is my castle now!
It's thanks to my father that I've been able to live here.
Wait over there, I'll make some tea.
If it's not any trouble...
No trouble at all!
Honestly, I'm overjoyed.
I lost my mother early, seven years flew by before I realized it...
And my father...
Who would have thought I'd have a relative?
Well, everyone in the guild is like my family, kind of...
But honestly, I...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
What happens to Iris after this?!
That's what the tears are about?
And hey, don't read that without permission!
Nee-san, you write novels?
Eat or talk: Pick one.
But, what is this thing?
I couldn't find any information on it.
That's so cool. I envy you.
You've got a dream for your future. You're already a wizard... What a fulfilling life.
You think?
Yes!
I don't have any dreams.
So, what are you going to do now?
Why don't you stay here, then?
You can stay here.
But, are you sure I won't be in the way?
Not at all!
Then I'll look for a job here in Magnolia and we can share the rent!
Um, need a tissue?
But hey, if you want work, why not work at Fairy Tail?
Me, work at Fairy Tail?
Michelle Lobster came to deliver a memento to me from my father.
Cheers!
Like an older, younger sister that suddenly showed up.
Cleaning, laundry, sewing, cooking...
She can do everything, and really makes my life easier.
She doesn't speak much about herself, but she seems somehow helpless.
Although there's a lot of things about her you'd mistake at first glance.
Something just makes you want to protect her.
I've got to up my game.
Mother, I wonder if Father got her to come to me so I wouldn't be lonely?
Work! Let's go, Lucy! ...he says!
Asuka-chan, you came today?
She's taken a real liking to me.
Mustache, mustache!
Hey, hey!
Natsu's looking for you.
Time to round up some bandits.
Bandits?
You're late, Lucy!
Time's a wastin'!
I would like to come see this job!
No way! It's dangerous!
But, I would like to see what it's like being a wizard...
It's a blast!
Especially the part about never knowing what'll happen with this team.
Me? I don't mind.
But, what will the Master say?
Master?
V-V!
You heard the man.
4th, what say you?
Sure, I'll let you go.
I have no objections, either.
Everything is an experience.
And you get the most out of things that other people say you're not ready for.
Remember how you went off on an S Class quest right after you joined, Lucy?
Now that you mention it...
Okay. Well, why don't you come along?
Yay!
Everyone will be together, and if anything happens, I'll protect you!
Alrighty!
This'll be the Bandit Hunt in Honor of Lucy Getting a Little Sister! I'm all fired up!
According to the request flier, the victims now all suffer from nightmares.
Sounds like they had a real number done on'em.
The soldiers from the kingdom scoured the mountains,
but they all came back crying like babies, it says.
Yeah, I knew this sounded dangerous...
Oh yes, is anyone else hungry?
You are? I'm fine, thanks.
It's amazing that you're more reliable than the kingdom's soldiers!
When you put it that way, I suppose.
I borrowed it from the client!
Your driving is nuts!
Here's the plan.
First, in order to catch the bandits off guard, Lucy and I will ride in the front,
to provide the illusion of two women traveling.
Natsu, Gray, and Michelle who is here to observe, will hide themselves in the back.
After they surround us, Lucy will use her sex appeal to distract the ones in front,
and in the meantime, Natsu and Gray will clean up the guys in the back.
For the rest, we'll attack on both sides and...
Hold it a sec!
I can't go riding in no carriage!
Oho? You have an objection to my plan? Some nerve you've got.
I'm not budging from this position!
What's the matter?
He can't handle transportation.
That's an odd weakness.
Figure it out yet?
Put your clothes back on!
If you'd like, I can handle the reins.
That means you'll be a decoy, you know.
It's dangerous.
It'll be easier if we concentrate our attack power in the back, right?
And I want to be helpful, too!
What'll we do?
Oh, my...
More customers?
Quite a large haul today.
In the end, this is the compromise...
Quiet already.
This is all thanks to Erza and her annoying plans, anyway.
Complain to Erza, then!
No thanks!
You tell her.
Figured you'd say that.
Here they are.
Don't leave my side, okay?
Here we go... Erza plan, step one!
Right!
Well hellooo there, fellas!
All set?
Sure.
And what's this Erza plan, again?
We're like, totally lost!
Step one, success!
Oh my, how indecent!
This girl is just...
I can't believe this!
My skin is just as shiny as yours!
Same for me!
Enough with Miss Ugly, let's get the cargo.
This wasn't in the plan!
Maybe they've got cosmetic supplies!
Me, I want sweets!
Sorry, but we're the cargo!
It's a man!
He's cute!
Fools!
How dare you make a mockery of my plan I stayed up all night thinking of!
I'll arrest you all at once!
Stop right there, criminal scum!
Stayed up all night? Sheesh...
You're wizards?! You tricked us!
You're not what we expected, either.
This is unforgivable.
Onee-sama!
How dare you defile we pure maidens with your filthy deceit!
How dare you look down on us just because you were born a woman!
Onee-sama, so cute!
I see now...
I guess this is what people were having nightmares of.
It's time for your punishment!
Get down, Lucy-neesan!
Hey, what are you doing?
Now! Fleuve d'Etoile!
Huh? Hey, what's the deal?!
Out of magic power? That shouldn't be...
Here we go, Happy!
Aye, sir!
Dazzling Blaze of the Fire Dragon!
So, will you come with us without resistance?
Wow! I'm dazzled!
Your team really is strong, Nee-san!
Yeah, I'll try and work hard too next time.
How was it?
Wizards are amazing...
Guilds are a lot of fun!
Yup. We make a ton of racket, but there's never a dull day.
So, what'd you find?
I got an acquaintance of mine to look into things.
Laki's gone to get the report.
Oh, speak of the devil.
Good work.
Sorry about making you handle this kind of stuff.
At any rate, this is what they found.
The Lobster Family really was a wealthy plantation family concentrated in the Zentopia Church Parish.
Guess I was worried for nothing.
Well, there was the time with Mest... I mean, Dranbalt.
But it's still a relief.
Hold up a second. The Lobster family was a wealthy plantation family? Why the past tense?
That's because a number of years ago there was a terrible incident.
Oh, you mean that.
Then, Michelle is a survivor?
I don't understand this at all.
Burnt to the ground, and this time corroded?
If I consider the distance between each parish, and the varied magic traces,
I can come to no other conclusion than there are multiple culprits.
No...
Who is he?
He seems to have been out when the tragedy happened.
What? But I heard there was a body discovered here...
Yes...
But I was sure this church only had the one priest...
Then, who was the victim?
He's very insistent that there was no one there.
Um, Lucy-neesan... I've been thinking.
What?
As long as you can pay money, guilds will do what you want, right?
Guess so.
I was thinking, why not request the guild to investigate that memento?
That's so smart of you, Michelle!
I see.
Never heard of a wizard asking a wizard for help!
Hand over a request flier upstairs.
We'll pass it on.
Good idea, Lucy!
Who's gonna volunteer?
Putting in a request for the guild?
I got permission!
I want to do something to help you understand what Uncle Jude wanted to say to you.
Okay! Then, I'll take it on!
Don't break it now. Understand?
Quiet, you! I know that!
So, it's a fateful union?
They've both lost their families...
But...
You went and researched her identity... Not bad.
Well, I am the Master, after all.
This is how I got us through these seven years.
Speaking of which...
There's something else that's worrying me...
Hey!
Are you okay?
What?
What in the world?
Something's appearing!
It's letters.
Those ancient letters?
In that case, get Levy-chan to...
She's not here! She's off far away with Shadow Gear on a job.
And so is Fried.
It's trying to tell us something...
Father...
Can't you read those characters, Gramps?
Lucy... You'd be better off not getting involved with this.
What do you mean?
But, Father...
I'm going to solve this riddle, no matter what!
Sheesh... Challenging Laxus to a fight, again?
You just never learn, Natsu.
Hey, it's not just me! Gajeel's the same way!
But you challenge Erza to a fight indiscriminately, too!
That's what it means to be a man always striving for the top!
That's what it means to be a man who doesn't know his place.
Got it?
Next time: Raging Battle! Natsu vs. Laxus!
Then, what about Lucy?
Lucy's still fighting with that short stick.
So after becoming an invisible figure, she wants to be a stick figure?
