Dream of life
Can you hear my heartbeat
Baby I trust you my friend
Are you seriously going on hiatus?
Mashiro is drawing with no intention of going on hiatus.
You saw him in the hospital, didn't you?
Mashiro probably won't be happy if all of you go on hiatus for TRAP's sake.
Yeah, probably not.
He might blame himself.
That's why we shouldn't tell him about this.
Anyway, if the Chief Editor doesn't go back on his decision about putting TRAP on hiatus,
we'll also put our four manga on hiatus.
That's what we've decided!
How long will this hiatus last?
Until Jack prints TRAP again, of course!
No objections.
How will you be able to keep your assistants until that happens?
You won't be able to continue paying them, right?
T-That's true...
I don't have enough to keep paying them until April.
I'll take care of that.
I've got tons of money and nothing to spend it on.
I'm glad it can come in handy.
That's what happens when someone sells 8.5 million copies over ten volumes.
How much do you want him to back down?
I am also dissatisfied with a hiatus until April.
If the Chief Editor said that the hiatus will only last until Mashiro gets out of the hospital, would you resume drawing?
Whether it's April or until he's discharged, we won't draw until TRAP appears in Jack again.
Hiramaru, you're just being an opportunist here.
Shut up.
W-What?!
We've all united together because we resent the steps the Chief Editor's taken.
It's not that I don't want to draw manga...
Liar.
Well, how about it?
I won't go for that.
If you're going to lay out conditions, persuade the Chief Editor first.
Looks like they're committed to this.
So, if the hiatus looks like it will last for many months, we will simply move to another magazine.
Should we say that yet?
D-Don't be ridiculous! We'll all be fired!
Is that so?
Well, Yuujirou's been doing a good job for me...
Then I'll just keep going and let my manga pile up.
I want to keep drawing, you see.
Please do so.
Nakai, Aoki, do you get it?
For hideout, going on hiatus won't work the same way as it does for a popular manga such as CROW.
You might be discontinued if you take this chance.
T-That'll be bad...
I don't mind.
I would rather willingly cancel our manga than deal with a Chief Editor who makes such unjust decisions.
I believe that he's wrong.
Yeah! Miss Aoki is the best!
Bravo! Bravo!
I like you, Aoki.
I'm telling you...!
There's no point in talking here with just the editors.
We'll go to the Chief Editor and let him have it.
Yes! Let's tell him clearly that we're taking a break.
Hey, wait!
We'll talk this over with the Chief Editor,
but you guys shouldn't come along.
Why?
It'll get complicated.
Like that huge mess with KOOGY.
Why can't they come with us?
I don't agree with the Chief Editor on this one, either.
Also, I have a hard time imagining these two quitting their boycott anytime soon.
Of course not!
Yuujirou is a reasonable man.
Even so, you'd better continue drawing your manuscripts.
The Chief Editor may take back his decisions about TRAP at any time.
Roger!
I know.
Wha...?
Hiramaru, you also need to keep drawing.
Got it?
W-Well, of course! How could you think I wouldn't, Mr. Yoshida?
Chief, may we have a word with you?
What is so important that my two lead editors need to speak with me?
Niizuma Eiji, Hiramaru Kazuya, Fukuda Shinta, and the team of Aoki Kou and Nakai Takuro...
in protest against your decision, have declared that they will also go on hiatus for the duration of the time that TRAP is on hiatus.
In other words, this is a boycott?
Yes.
Of course, we'll keep trying to convince them.
However, they are resolved in their decision.
At this point, they definitely will go on hiatus.
If the manuscripts fail to make their deadlines, that is the responsibility of the supervising editor,
and therefore, it becomes my responsibility as Chief Editor.
Well, again, if you remove the hiatus on TRAP, the four manga will resume
TRAP's hiatus is a settled matter.
Put forth your best efforts to see that those four manga's manuscripts continue to come in.
That is all I have to say.
But Chief...
This is something I have already decided.
Chief!
Don't worry, Mom.
I know my own body best.
You never listen to me!
Good afternoon!
Miura!
Hi!
How are you feeling?
The Chief Editor said he won't print TRAP even if I keep drawing,
but I won't give up until the very end.
I'll finish it by Friday like always!
If the manuscript gets finished, I'll come and pick it up.
After his surgery, if he properly finishes his manuscripts,
the Chief Editor might re-think his decision and resume printing earlier than he said he would!
Y-Yeah.
Won't you at least make the hiatus only until Mashiro gets better...
instead of until Ashirogi Muto graduate from high school?
If you do that, then it may be possible to convince Niizuma and the others
Don't make me repeat myself.
What are you doing?
Make sure your authors do not let their manuscripts fall behind.
Shujin.
Sorry, but can you come by early tomorrow to take the manuscript to our office?
Mashiro, take it easy...
I know.
I'm sorry, ma'am. I should be trying to stop him...
No. I know full well that he won't stop.
He's stubborn, just like his father.
I shouldn't tell him about the boycott.
He'll just blame himself.
Come in.
Hello.
Miho!
Then I'll come by on Friday to get the manuscript.
Yes, please do.
I'll go home, then.
I have to make dinner for your grandpa.
Well, let's go, Miyoshi.
Oh, right.
You can stay, Kaya. Takagi, too.
What are you saying? We'll let you have some time alone together.
Kiss him!
Kiss!
See ya!
Oh, Kaya...
My surgery's been scheduled for this coming Monday.
I see.
Mashiro.
Here.
I'm worried about your surgery, after all.
Thanks.
On the day of your surgery, I'll skip school and come here.
You don't have to do that.
It's a surgery with a 99 rate of success.
Huh? What about the 1?
I'm definitely coming.
It'll be okay, right?
Yeah.
We're high school seniors, aren't we?
Yeah.
Um, why are you saying something so obvious?
Kaya just said...
Kiss him! Kiss!
C-Could she...!?
A-Azuki, because I have a 1 chance of dying, are you going to...?
Huh? What are you saying?
I don't think you'll die.
Why did you say that?
S-Sorry! I mean that I could die without having kissed
That's not it.
I wonder if I'm being strange.
I don't think I want to kiss you.
Oh, not like that.
I've never felt like I've wanted to.
I think I understand.
Really?
When I'm with you, it's like the inside of my head goes blank,
so I'm not thinking about that at all.
It's like, I'm just happy that we're together.
I'm glad.
I feel that way, too.
Is that really for the best?
I feel like I'm not treating you right.
It's fine.
I'm leaving him in your care, Doctor.
He'll be fine, ma'am.
Please don't worry so much.
Yes.
Don't make that face, Miyoshi.
I'm the one who should be nervous.
Yeah...
Would friends and family please wait in another room?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I'm going in.
Good luck, Mashiro.
Even you're worried.
I'll be fine. I have your good luck charm.
Roll him in.
Okay.
I'm glad your surgery went well.
Yes, I can leave the hospital soon.
Don't push yourself.
I have a present for you two today.
The first volume of Detective TRAP!
It just got delivered today.
A-Awesome!
It's like a real manga!
It is a real manga!
This'll be lined up in stores all over the country, right?
Of course!
Aren't you Mr. Obvious today.
It's no good. I can't read it with tears in my eyes.
Saiko, let's hurry up and resume serialization!
Yeah!
You're just being stubborn about handing it over.
Are you okay with betraying your readers like that?!
I apologize, but it's already settled.
Hail boycotting!
So you won't change your mind, then.
Of course not.
So you'd better change the Chief Editor's mind.
I truly apologize.
Please wait a bit.
Chief.
What?
The printing office won't wait any longer.
I know it's not in there, but I won't believe it until I see it.
Yeah.
It's kinda lonely.
Hm?
Huh?
What?
It's not just TRAP!
CROW, KIYOSHI, Otters, and hideout door aren't in here, either!
W-Why?!
Miura, what exactly does this mean?!
Since TRAP has been forced to go on hiatus, they are also boycotting.
The reason put here for us is Due to sudden illness,
but the reason put for them is Due to circumstances of the author.
Isn't it going to be a big problem if Jack gets published like this?
Oh, all you authors are awesome!
Can't wait to see what happens on Monday.
Really awesome!
In any case, we've taken a break for one week.
I'll use that time to draw an even better manuscript.
Well, now I can rest for a week.
You're the one who seems to be the happiest about the hiatus, Hiramaru.
Fukuda and the rest have said that they will go on hiatus until TRAP is printed in Jack again.
That's what they're demanding.
I won't have that!
It's not right for everyone to have to take a break for our sake!
Right!
Mashiro, if you get too excited, your stitches will...
Most importantly, the readers...
What about the readers who look forward to those manga every week?!
I understand how you feel.
Will you accept a hiatus until you're discharged?
W-Why are even you talking about that?
Chapters 20 and 21 are ready!
I'll even have chapter 22 done by Monday!
I know, but...
If we can convince the Chief Editor with that condition,
Fukuda and the rest may stop boycotting,
because they are the most upset about you having to go on hiatus until you graduate.
I don't want them to have to take a break.
If that's the only way...
I'm very sorry. In regard to that matter,
as explained in the publication it is due to authors' circumstances...
This is Jack's Editing Department.
I'm sorry. Regarding your inquiry of the hiatus this week...
Well, of course this would happen.
Jack has five titles on hiatus.
It would even make the news.
Akira! Yuujirou!
Why are you just sitting there and chatting?!
Answer the phones!
The phones were off the hook this morning.
Things calmed down a bit in the afternoon.
I see.
If this mass hiatus continues next week, it'll be an even bigger problem.
You may not be able to accept it, but...
Miura.
Can you call Fukuda and Niizuma here?
Don't give me that shit!
If they've finished, then just knock them down and grab the manuscripts!
That's an old-fashioned way of thinking.
Listen up! If next week's issue still has those four manga on hiatus,
prepare to be fired!
It's not just you. The Chief Editor's head may roll for this!
Well, it's not like we can just...
I will try to obtain it.
Miura's calling me, so I'm heading out for a bit.
Aren't I more important than Miura?
Yes, in terms of office hierarchy.
Please stop your boycott.
We're fine with a hiatus until I'm discharged.
Are you really fine with that?
We don't have a choice.
I don't want to, but it's my fault for getting sick.
Ashirogi themselves are saying it.
You should end this.
Wait a minute.
Do we have your guarantee that if we stop the boycott,
TRAP will resume as soon as he gets discharged from the hospital?
Er, not yet.
What's with that?
If Ashirogi is okay with that, then I am, too.
Really?
Then I'll put my neck on the line to convince the Chief Editor.
I didn't agree with him on this in the first place.
I don't really care about your neck, though.
All right! Fine!
But if TRAP isn't resumed after all this, I'll really lose it and wring your neck myself!
Y-Yeah!
That's how it is, Hiramaru.
I-I'm so glad. The readers are waiting for Otters...
Good job on convincing them.
However, TRAP will only resume after Ashirogi Muto graduate from high school.
Chief!
Yuujirou, don't get so fired up!
We still have time...
It's not something that'll be resolved with more time!
I will send CROW and KIYOSHI to the press.
What should I do?
I want to get their serialization resumed as quickly as possible.
They really are serious.
What can I do for them as their editor?
It got announced, huh?
Yeah, but that was planned over six months ago.
And our second volume has been postponed until after we resume.
He got ahead of us again.
Has the Chief Editor still not agreed yet?
N-No...
That's not fair, since they already agreed to stop the boycott.
I'm sorry.
Chapter 25 is finished.
A-All right. I'll look at it right now.
Amazing. The quality hasn't dropped at all since he's been in the hospital.
On the contrary, it's improved!
TRAP is really good.
Even so...
But you know,
at this rate, they'll have stopped boycotting for no reason!
Which means that if it isn't resumed once he gets out, then Fukuda really will go crazy.
He's kept up with his manuscripts, though.
Mashiro's working hard.
By September, we'll have about 10 unpublished chapters.
No matter how many we'll have, all we can do now is make manga.
That's it!
I don't know if it'll work, but it's definitely worth trying!
We don't talk much, do we?
If our dreams come true and we g-get married...
it might still be like this.
Probably.
Probably?
Even if we stop being so shy, we're just normally quiet people.
Does that sound okay to you?
Yeah, it's fine.
I think so, too.
What's most important now is to keep working hard, without giving up.
Congrats on your discharge!
Sorry for worrying you.
Then, let's go.
Yes!
Finally, huh?
Sorry, Mom.
I'll be heading to the editorial department before going home...
Oh, it's fine. I understand.
Go on.
Then, I'll be going.
Yeah.
I am also dissatisfied with a hiatus until April.
It's not something that'll be resolved with more time!
An editor's job is to receive the manuscript from the authors...
and to make sure it's put on the page.
These are the manuscripts he drew while in the hospital.
One per week.
He handed them in one by one without a drop in quality.
On the contrary, they got even better!
I have 11 chapters here.
Which means that if you start publishing them now,
they'll last until the end of the year!
Mashiro has also made a complete recovery.
More than anything, the fact that he drew all of these while in the hospital...
proves his strength to continue serializing!
While you set all this up, did you stop to think about what you would have done in the worst case scenario?
I refused to let anyone stop me!
I also went along with it!
M-My uncle, Kawaguchi Tarou, said that until you get serialized, it's about conceit, effort, and luck.
Once you've managed to get serialized, it's physical strength, emotional strength, and finally, guts!
Kawaguchi Tarou read too many sports manga.
Fine.
I will gladly accept your gutsy manuscripts.
I will resume TRAP as quickly as possible!
Thank you!
Thank god...
We did it!
Those three really did it.
Guts, of all things... Is this the 80's, or something?
Miura.
Th-This is the same thing you did before the serialization meeting...
Takagi, Mashiro.
Yes?
You pushed it way too far!
S-Sorry.
You did well. You tried really hard!
I can finally draw manga again!
Aoki and I won't lose, either!
But being a pro is really tough.
Resumption and Low-Rank.
I had a dream about going on a date with Aoki!

The fight doesn't end until I fulfill my dream
I wonder how far I've come now?
In ten years, I'll be living the dream
It's the scenario I wrote for myself, so I'll have no regrets
But life isn't that easy, and it's full of obstacles
Still, I swear to myself that I won't ever back down
I have a dream that I absolutely want to achieve
So I fuel my passion until I succeed
There will be meetings and partings along the way
But I'll simply believe in my strength that you've taught me
And rise back up again and again and again

In this world, every day is dull and full of nonsense
I cover my ears, trying to mute the noise
Why do people hurt each other?
In the contradictory, overlapping shadows
on the recesses of my heart, fallen into despair
While carrying this pain in my chest,
can I really dream of tomorrow?
can I really dream of tomorrow?
Remembering the rainbow I found after the rain,
