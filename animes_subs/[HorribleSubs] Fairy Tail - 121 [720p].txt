Everyone, brace yourselves and listen well!
I have an extremely important announcement to make.
What?
From the day after we return to the guild from Tenroujima...
I'm gonna introduce a women's only dress code!
You gotta choose between a nurse outfit or a school swimsuit!
I ain't heard about this!
I see. Sounds like fun.
Don't encourage him!
You're supposed to be mad about this!
Master... This is no time for jokes.
I'm sorry! I was just caught up...
Zeref...
The Right to Love.
The Zeref... is standing before my eyes...
Is this a dream? Or reality?
The keys!
Bring the keys!
We...
We can't move...
There's no need.
I am awake.
Maybe I'm not one to talk,
but how many lives did you take in order to get these keys?
Such a tragedy.
Those keys were nothing more than illusions.
W-What?!
Just one of the stories made by a sect of the believers in the Black Wizard Zeref...
The Keys To Resurrect Zeref.
Were you fooled by that dusty old fairy tale?
I was never asleep in the first place.
The man you see before you is the Black Wizard Zeref.
You were never asleep?!
I used my eye and saw you!
I saw you, not even able to defeat one of my servants!
Then I can skip to the chase.
That was what I was capable of...
You see, 400 years ago I saw countless wars of man... Countless deaths...
But, after a certain day, I learned the value of life.
Ever since then, the more I feel the value of life,
the more my accursed body steals people's souls.
In order not to steal people's souls, I cannot forget the weight of a human life.
I sidelined myself.
You're saying you were fighting while valuing life?
Yes... And because of that, I can't use my magic anywhere close to how I'd wish to...
But that all changes if I forget about the value of life.
You were the people who pulled the trigger.
Acnologia will herald the end of an era.
Your evil deeds have summoned it.
Acnologia?!
What in the world are you talking about?
You all shall be punished.
W-Wait!
I still have things I want to ask!
Your first sin is summoning Acnologia!
And your second sin...
Repent.
Meldy...
You don't seem very cheerful...
It might be difficult right now... But let's forget everything.
Forget about Grimoire Heart, and Zeref...
Look, dolphins!
Tell me, Ultear.
Is it true you were the one who destroyed my town, Ultear?
My family... My friends...
You took them all, Ultear...
That's right.
I was going to tell you everything, one day...
I thought that I was on just the first lap of my life.
Then, when I went to the World of Great Magic
and perfected the Time Ark, I would start the second lap.
I believed that I would redo everything that happened in the first lap...
That's why I was able to do such horrible things, and stray so far from the path of humanity...
The second lap would be my true life!
Your true life!
The two of us would be happy...
It was all... for that.
I know.
It was all just what I planned.
To other people, I'm a devil.
Piling sins on top of sins, I'm a fool of a woman with delusions of a happy life...
I'm not... going to ask you to forgive me.
But, let me tell you that I'm sorry.
Yeah... You must hate me enough to kill me.
But...
Because, I'll disappear from this world...
Ultear!
You will find happiness... I'm sure you'll be happy...
I love you, Meldy...
Ultear!!
The sea...
Inside of my mother.
A fitting place to meet my end.
Meldy?
Let's live.
A Sense Link?!
I know all the sadness and pain you feel, Ultear!
You are the one who raised me, Ultear.
That isn't going to change!
I forgive you!
I forgive you, okay?!
So never say anything like that again, understand?!
Please, don't leave me alone!
I love you! Let's live on, together!
M-Master Hades is...
D-D-D...
Know your place, trash.
Fall to the pits of hell.
It's here... Acnologia!
What?!
Like-I-said! The S Class Wizard Advancement Exam is on hold!
I can't accept that, Gramps!
Why is it on hold?
Make me S Class, damn it!
You're not even a candidate! You mean Levy, got it?!
What else can I do?
A lot's happened.
A member of the Magic Council infiltrated the candidates,
and Grimoire Heart disrupted everything...
I guess we have no choice.
Hey! You're really okay with this, damn it?!
And you shouldn't be so worked up about it.
Argh! I so wanted to be S Class!
Don't worry! You'll make it next time for sure, Gray-sama!
A Man has to know when to call it quits...
Well, I ain't givin' up!
I'm gonna be S Class, no matter what!
Gray, Elfman, and Levy all gave up, right?
Then I'll become S Class!
I'm gonna be S Class!
Calm down, Natsu.
Guess I got no choice...
Let's start the final test right now, special!
Beat me, and I'll make you S Class, Natsu.
Seriously, Gramps?!
Okay! I'm all fired up!
Here I come!
I give!
What're you doing?
Well, I was wonderin' whether you were the real deal.
I am! How rude!
Don't bully her too much, I'll feel sorry for her.
Such insight... As expected from Laxus.
You should learn from him.
Y-You think?
You think, you think?
Enough! I told you I'm the real Lisanna!
Okay, okay! My bad!
I'm kind of scared just to say hi, Carla.
Huh? What are you scared of?
I'm sure you've heard a bunch of stories, but he's not a bad guy deep down.
Erza-san!
He's just a little awkward at times.
Right! I'm going to introduce myself!
Oww...
A medicinal herb spring, huh?
It definitely works itself into these wounds...
Cana, is your right arm okay?
The right arm I borrowed Fairy Glitter with?
Looks like my rental's up.
Yeah.
Um, Lucy... I'm sorry.
About what?
You know... When I left you behind and went to Mavis's grave... I...
I'm not upset about it!
Well, I am.
I'll regret how I betrayed my friend for the rest of my life...
You didn't really betray me or anything.
Just a little prank like that happens all the time in the guild, right?
If you keep thinking about it the way you are,
it's going to be hard on me, too. You know?
I think I'm going to try telling my father the truth,
even though I didn't become an S Class wizard.
What's with the bored look?
'Cause this is a total snore-fest.
You don't understand. Fishing is a man's romantic adventure.
Yes! Everyone loves fish!
I never said you could eat them!
The hunter's instinct, driving up...
The feeling of being one with nature!
A serious battle of eat or be eaten!
This, indeed, is a man's playground!
I hooked something!
Good, Natsu!
Pull, pull!
Gildarts!
Hold on a sec!
Natsu is finally awakening his manly spirit of romantic adventure!
Cana said she's got something important to talk about!
Natsu, Happy... You guys come with me.
The fish!
Everyone's food!
What is it?
The reason I came to the guild was... to search for my father, you know?
Actually, that's the first I've heard of it.
So then, you're saying your dad was in Fairy Tail?
Y-Yeah.
You can do it, Cana!
Go back, you two!
It's you, Gildarts.
A lot happened, and I was never able to tell you.
W-Wait a second!
You're...
I know it's a lot to just accept...
Whose kid are you?
Sara? Naomi? Claire? Feena? Mary? Eliza?
No, no... The hair color's off...
Emma, Lyra, Jean, Sydney, Kate, Yuko, Francoise...
You old geezer! How many flings have you had?!
I-I know! You're the spitting image of Sylvia!
Like, you're the same sex!
God, you're making me angry!
I can't believe that such a philandering loser is my old man!
Anyway, so now you know! Bye!
W-Wait!
That's all I wanted to say.
I'm not saying we should be family or anything, got it?
I'm fine with things staying the way they are...
You're Cornelia's child...
I'm sure of it.
Let go of me.
Why did you keep quiet all this time?
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.
And time just flew by...
Cornelia is the only woman I ever loved.
She's the only one I married.
She left me after getting frustrated from me always being away on jobs, 18 years ago.
I heard that she had passed away.
But to think she left a child...
I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was you.
It's okay.
I purposefully hid it from you. Sorry about being so selfish.
I finally feel a weight has been lifted off my chest.
I had a daughter this close to me...
Don't be like that...
I'm not saying you should take responsibility for me or anything.
Let's just stay as we are.
But, let me say this, just once...
I'm glad I got to meet you, Father.
Cana!
I'll never let you feel lonely again!
Never again!
From now on, when I go on a job... or out drinking...
It'll be together with you, always!
That could get a little annoying.
So... Please give me the right to love you!
Her father, huh?
When I get back, maybe I'll go see him again.
We all stood there under the warm sun.
Year 784, December 16th.
Tenroujima...
Its destruction came so quickly...
Natsu, I've got something I'd like to talk with you about...
What's up? Why're you so fidgety?
I guess asking Natsu isn't going to help...
No, there's always the slight chance a miracle could happen!
What are you muttering to yourself about?
U-Um, I... If I'm going to hold Carla's ha...
You and Carla?
Quiet! Not so loud!
Next time: Hold Hands!
Oh, that? That's easy!
If you're a man, just give it a shot, make it or break it!
Yeah, I don't want anything broken is why I'm asking...
Well, then you've got the wrong guy.
