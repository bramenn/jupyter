Yes, and they're the wild hunters.
They're all specially trained to catch all of the ghosts within twelve days.
Each of them has been highly trained to catch all of the ghosts within twelve days.
And you have to catch this year's ghosts before the year ends.
Does that mean they're going to come to Blytonbury too?
Then we can see them here in person?
Yes, even the other teachers are in high spirits too.
Professor, what are you looking at?
We were actually dragged in to helping her make a weapon for the Wild Hunt.
Why's she making that?
Please forgive me! Okay?
Though it's really just taking some stuff to our room.
Though it's really just bringing stuff to our room.
What do you mean? You're doing it alone?
Fine! Bring it, cage!
From the days we were little, we were obsessed with just one thing!
We've been obsessed with a single thing ever since we were kids!
Stanbot?! They multiplied!
It's not like Constanze has asked you either.
Have you finally given up on Cons yet?
You're getting in the way of my work.
You need it to make your boat, right?
So I cannot simply tell you its location.
It is most certainly not an issue of money!

Are you seriously taking that without paying?!
Laypeople are scary.
You don't need to go that far!
Man, watching you kinda made me think that really anything is possible.
Man, watching you made me think that anything really was possible.
I tried to come up with the ultimate magic mecha.
Though I guess there's no way this would work... right?
How could I possibly let such an entertaining chance slip?
How could I possibly not make use of such an entertaining chance.
This is the place from the rumors, right?
If you buy some of these goods, they'll ward off at least some of the negative ghost mojo.
It seems that talk of a ghost sighting in the plains around Blytonbury was trending online last night.
It seems that talk of a ghost sighting in Blytonbury's fields was trending online last night.
I think that drew all these occult fans here.
It must've been fake.
Was that the wind?
Did you just feel a chill?
Let's raise anchor!
Isn't it kinda noisy?
What the hell is this thing?!
Our burning souls turned into magic power!
The shining seven stars of justice!
Complete!
They must be idiots.
You mean we used it up for the transformation?
But we had so much before!
Attention hunters!
The Wild Hunt is going to be ruined if something isn't done.
Magic at a hundred-twenty percent!
Miracle Magical Shining Tornado Punch!
Wild Hunt is the best!
It was all an experiment to cause a panic and measure the reaction of emotional energy, fuel spirit.
Just what are you trying to do here?!
Just what are you planning to do?
There's nothing you can do to stop me from reaching them.
There's not a single thing you can do about it.
This is the Wild Hunt?
Yes, and those guys are the wild hunters.
They're aces who are specially trained to catch all of the ghosts within twelve days.
You've got to catch all of this year's ghosts before the year ends.
Does that mean they're coming to Blytonbury too?
On the final day, the twelfth night.
Then we get to see them here in person?
Yes, even the other teachers are in high spirits.
So thrilling and exciting!
Professor, is something the matter?
Huh? Oh, nothing at all.
Huh? That's Constanze's...
Wait up!
Hold on! You dropped this!
Ouch...
Whoops...
Take action!
Take action!

Is Constanze here?
Oh, Akko. Cons is out right now.
Oh...
You need her for something?
Actually...
I broke her Stanbot.
She's gonna be pissed.
Thing is, she dragged us into helping her build a weapon for the Wild Hunt.
Why's she working on that?
Cause she's gonna be in the Wild Hunt.
Seriously?! For real?
Professor Croix gave her special permission to enter.
Wow, that's awesome.
Ah, that...
Ow...
Whoa, what is all this?
Constanze!
U-Um...
Sorry!
I broke your Stanbot!
I'm really sorry! But it was an accident!
Forgive me, okay? Please!
I'll help you out with anything you want in exchange!
Wait, wait! Just calm down!
We can talk this out!
Are you okay?
That does sound rough.
But we all know that Akko's help is anything but.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Yo.
What're you doing?
Running some errands in Stanbot's place.
Though it's really just taking stuff to our room.
Gimme that! I'll do it.
She leaves me no choice but to force my help down her throat!
Constanze!
I brought it!
Wow, that looks amazing!
Sorry!
Here you go!
I cooked for you!
Constanze!
Constanze!
Constanze!
Constanze!
Constanze!
Constanze!
Let me out! I can't help you like this!
What do you mean? You want to do it all yourself?
Fine! Try and hold me back, cage!
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Whoa!
This is what she's using for the Wild Hunt?
Hey, I was just thinking...
Aren't we kind of similar?
Ever since we were little, we were obsessed with just one thing!
It didn't matter what anyone else said about it!
We just go straight down the path we've chosen!
Don't you agree?
Come on, there are some things you can't do alone...
Akko! Bother!
Constanze wants to be alone!
Stanbot?! He's multiplying...
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
H-Hey
Go away!
Go away!
Hold on!
Go away!
Go away!
Hey, that was fast.
You don't need to force yourself to help her.
It's not like Constanze has asked you, either.
Even I know that, but still...
You just want to bother Constanze then?
No way! Of course not!
Then just let her do what she wants.
I think she just honestly prefers being alone.

Hey, Akko.
You finally give up on Cons yet?
I want this.
Not happening. That's an important cooking utensil.
It's not a toy.
Plus, you're getting in the way of my work.
Shoo, shoo.
Hey.
Have you heard of the Wild Hunt?
Here! The orichalcum whisk!
You need it to build your boat, right?
When I explained why we needed it, he let us borrow it until the Wild Hunt ends.
After I said you'd be participating...
That's incredible!
He got all excited.
The Planta Tartarica Barometz grows on sacred land that is forbidden to trod on.
I cannot simply tell you its location.
Listen: this is not an issue of money.
It is most certainly not an issue of money!
Barometz?!
I know what that is! It's the plant that grows into a golden sheep!
Barometz
There is no plant as efficient as Barometz Soft fleece surrounds its supple meat
Fountain of Polaris
The magic fountain that reveals the path of light located at Luna Nova. It bestows the great magic power of the stars unto the witch with hidden radiance.
It's on one of the Chariot cards!
I know where to find it too!
Leave this to me!
Hey!
You're taking that without paying as much as a penny?!
But you said it wasn't an issue of money!
Metamorphie Faciesse!
Here! A Planta Tartarica Barometz!
I'm not really skilled or clever like you are, but I'm confident in my stamina and ability to take action.
If you let me handle the things you aren't good at, don't you think we'll be able to make something truly amazing?
It's fine to do some things alone,
but together we'll be able to do the impossible!
Are these... materials for the ship?
So then...
You want me to collect them, right?
Okay!
I'll do it!
Let's work hard together, Constanze!
Akko, what are you doing?
I thought up an idea of my own, so I drew a picture of it.
Show it! Show it!
Impossible. Cannot be done.
A childish delusion.
Oh, stuff it!
You can't expect me to be as good as Constanze.
Are you an idiot?
Amateurs are scary.
Beginning to doubt sanity.
You don't need to go that far!
Go away!
Sorry, did I wake you?
Man, watching you kinda made me think that anything really is possible.
So I tried coming up with something like an ultimate magic mecha.
But yeah, I guess there's no way this would work... right?
Constanze?
Ghost hunt.
How could I possibly let such an entertaining chance slip by?
It's today!
The final day of the Wild Hunt!
The rumors were about this place, right?
I think I felt a presence just now!
If you buy some of these goods, you'll get spared some of the bad ghost mojo, probably.
What's going on?
It seems that talk of a ghost sighting in the plains around Blytonbury went viral online last night.
I think that's what drew all these occult fans here.
It's not like normal people can even see the ghost hunt.
Who the hell let it leak?
Things are gonna get messy.
It couldn't be...
Look!
They're here!
I wonder when it'll start.
When are they supposed to appear?
It must've been fake.
Just a bit longer!
You think?
Is the wind picking up?
Did you... just feel a chill?
All right! Captain!
Let's raise the anchors!
Bon voyage!
They're here!
It's Constanze and Akko!
Constanze!
Damn awesome!
That's the stuff!
Go.
Isn't it getting kinda noisy?
Hey, what the hell're those?!
Those are...
Captain, there's trouble!
What in the world is this thing?!
Got it!
Constanze! Let's do that!
Let's Metamor-formation!
Burning souls turned into magic power!
The seven shining stars of justice!
A believing heart is our magic!
Magic Suit Grand Charion!
On stage!
What is that?
Those guys are such morons.
So cool!
We nailed it!
My idea was a perfect success!
You're a real genius, Constanze!
Why aren't we moving?
We're out of magic power!
You mean we used it all up for the transformation?!
But we had so much of it!
That's it!
Attention, hunters!
If this goes on, the Wild Hunt will be ruined!
Please, lend them your strength!
Magic at one hundred and twenty percent!
Now, Constanze!
Grand Charion Big Wheel!
Miracle Magical Shining Tornado Punch!
Wild Hunt rocks!
We did it!
I guessed correctly.
What it is that you did.
An experiment. You caused a panic among the people to gauge their rise in emotional energyfuel spirit.
Am I wrong?
Just what are you plotting?!
You'll find out soon enough.
That no matter what my goals are...
There's not a single thing you can do to stop me.
For me?
It's thanks for helping her out.
Really, you didn't need to do this.
So cool!
And slow.
But I'm flying on a broom!
You call that flying?
Thanks, Constanze!
