In order to stop the out-of-control Laxus,
Erza, and even Mystogan, challenged him in battle.
But after an unexpected turn of events,
Erza headed to destroy the Thunder Palace on her own,
while Natsu and Laxus began a confrontation with the guild on the line!
Yo Ho! Steer that rudder! Hard to port!
Yo Ho! Our high-flyin' lives are every which way!
When the sun goes down, there's a bon voyage bash.
It ain't sad at all.
As long as we're alive, we'll meet again somewhere!
Blast straight through a headwind, set off!
Stay strong until the tears dry up! A man gotta be tough.
Friends, friends, laugh one day!
As proof of our strong, strong bonds!
Now, grab that map to the shining future!
Warren!
Where is he?
Damn it!
Triple Dragon!
198...
199...
If I want to destroy them all at once, I still need more...
I'm already out of magical power.
And I'm also out of time.
What should I do?
There's not even three minutes until the Thunder Palace activates!
What'll you do, Natsu?
Ain't nothing... gonna happen!
Shut the hell up!
Unless I have another 100 blades...
I can't... simultaneously...
Hey, can everyone hear me?
Warren?
This is an emergency!
Look up at the sky!
It's in my head?
Telepathy?
Wake up you lazy bums!
Warren?
The sky?
What the heck are those?
And if there's anyone still fighting, hold up for now!
What's this?
There's a voice in my head...
That's Warren's telepathy.
He can speak directly into people's minds.
Listen up, everyone!
We gotta destroy those things floating in the sky with all the magic power we got!
It's a magic spell from Laxus that'll attack the city!
There's no time!
Everyone do it!
What's this?
Those are Laxus's...
Warren, why do you know about the Thunder Palace?
That voice... Erza?
You're okay?
Gray!
I see, so it was you.
Yeah.
Took me a while to find the guy.
Erza? You're not turned to stone?
So, if Erza's okay...
Everyone is safe.
Worry not.
Juvia is also okay.
So is Bisca, Alzack.
I see...
Thank goodness... Really...
Sorry.
My telepathy can't reach all the way to the guild.
We'll have to do it with the people who can hear me.
Destroy those things up in the sky!
Damn you, Warren!
Did you forget what you did to me?
Max?
I'm sorry about that, man...
I was, like, really trying to save Erza and the others, so...
This is Droy!
Can you hear me, Alzack?
I-I hear you.
I'm sorry about before.
You think that's gonna cut it?
You hit me with a sneak attack!
And you, Wakaba!
We're not gonna forgive you, Laki!
Save the fightin' for later!
You're one to talk!
There is no time now!
Destroy the things floating in the sky!
You don't get it, do you?
When I don't hold back, I'm way stronger!
What? As if!
You always attack first, think later!
That sounds more like you!
Everyone, listen!
This isn't the time to be fighting!
The people of the city are in real danger!
We have to all work together to protect the city of Magnolia!
If we combine our powers, we can overcome anything!
That's what I've learned after coming here.
I know I just joined Fairy Tail recently.
But my feelings for this guild are as strong as anybody's!
Fairy Tail has been my dream since long ago...
It's always been my goal.
Even now.
So, please...
Let's all work together...
Let's protect our guild...
Lucy...
And if that won't convince you...
I'll destroy all the lacrima myself!
Listen up people!
You really gonna let the newbie one up you like that?
She's not new any more...
She's got more Fairy Tail spirit than any of us!
Lucy, you're exactly right.
We'll settle things later.
I can't argue with that, now can I?
Thanks to you, I'm thinking straight again.
Are all you folks ready?
You guys...
Everyone...
Warren, we'll settle this after those things are destroyed.
Makao, you can't handle this! Take a nap!
Oh, yeah? Wakaba!
You sure prance around a lot for an old man.
Let's go, Happy!
They have Body Link magic protecting them!
If you attack them, you'll get damaged yourself!
It's gonna hurt!
Even if it hurts, I'll do it anyway!
I always looked up to Fairy Tail...
And I've gotten to be such good friends with everyone...
Sure, a lot of things have happened...
But everyone has always been so warm.
This guild is where I belong.
It's my home.
My heart yells out This is where I should be!
So I'm going to fight!
Because it was Fairy Tail that made me strong!
Right on!
Let's go!
Aye, sir!
I'll handle the 200 to the north!
The rest of you destroy all the ones around the south!
Don't leave a single one left!
Ice Make Lance!
Demon Blast!
Go forth, my blades!
Max Speed Attack!
What's this?
Some kind of fireworks?
Fairy Tail just keeps doing things flashier and flashier each year.
We did it...
See?
I told you so.
Everyone okay?
Honestly...
You people are so reckless.
Birds of a feather, you know...
We really are a great guild.
And we'd be even better if Laxus got over this rebellious phase.
No kidding.
Alzack, are you okay?
Droy?
Yeah. Thanks.
What part of this guild needs to be changed?
We're all in the same circle of friends.
You never even tried to join that circle! How're you gonna become the master, Laxus?
How am I going to become the master, you say?
By force!
Laxus, that's enough!
The master... Your grandfather... He's already...
That's about enough, Laxus.
Fairy Tail will never be yours now.
Oh, yes it will.
Yeah... Trying to force a bargain was pointless...
I should have relied on my own power from the start!
This overwhelming power is my very identity!
So when I beat that power, you'll finally give in, Laxus?!
Iron Fist of the Fire Dragon!
You'll be first!
Bring it on, Fairy Tail!
I'll devour you all!
He really is strong...
Resound, my summoned thunder's boom...
Crap... I can't move...
Fall from the heavens and turn all to ashes!
Raging Bolt!
Natsu!
Who was the strongest in the guild again?
Oh, I'm sorry. You can't answer because you've been turned to dust!
Weren't you his ally?
Something's wrong with you being happy he's wiped out.
Although he ain't been.
Gettin' rid of him is my role.
Gajeel...
Another snack shows up.
Disappear, disappear!
Anyone who stands in my way should just disappear!
I'll handle Laxus.
Stay back.
I've got a personal grudge with him.
His monstrous strength is the real deal though.
He's got Makarov's blood running in him.
I don't like it, but we've got no choice.
We'll fight together!
You're joking, right?
I'm gonna defeat Laxus!
I mean, how could I ever team up with you?!
Take a look.
Is that the Laxus you know?
Disappear! Disappear!
That's an enemy of the guild.
We have to stop him here to protect the guild.
The rest of them are down for the count after the counterattack from the Thunder Palace.
Do you realize what will happen if we don't stop him here?
You're gonna protect the guild?
Whether I protect the guild or destroy the guild, it's my choice!
Didn't you say that there wasn't room enough in the sky for two dragons?
There isn't.
But with all this annoying lightning, you can't fly in the sky.
Okay, but I'm only teaming up this once, Gajeel!
You got that right!
We'll settle things one day!
Let's do it!
Use your breath!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Pillar of the Iron Dragon!
Sword of the Iron Dragon!
Brilliant Blaze of the Fire Dragon!
Spears of the Iron Dragon!
Demon Poles!
Roar of the...
Roar of the...
Fire Dragon!
Iron Dragon!
That's the power of you working together?
I'm shocked you can call yourselves Dragon Slayers.
Didn't we damage him at all?
Impossible!
No matter how strong he is, after being hit with all that Dragon Slayer magic...
I can't believe it.
Well, it's simple really.
I hate the old man's lectures, so I kept it a secret.
But I'll show you special.
N-No way...
You've got to be kidding me.
Roar of the...
You're also a Dragon Slayer?
Oh?
Still alive?
Just stay down already.
My body...
I'm all numb...
You two, Erza, Mystogan,
the old man, the trash in the guild,
all the people in Magnolia...
I'll make them all disappear!
What's with this crazy magical power?
This power... It's Gramps's...
It targets everything the caster sees as an enemy...
Master Makarov's Ultimate Spell of Judgment!
Fairy Law!
That's right!
Fairy Law!
The spell that destroyed Master Joze in one hit...
Stop it, Laxus!
Laxus!
Stop it, Laxus!
Levy!
You idiot!
Why are you here?
Laxus!
The master is...
The master... Your grandfather is...
So please, stop this!
Come see him!
On death's door? Gramps?
He's gonna die?
Laxus!
Perfect timing!
Now my chance of becoming master just went back up!
The bastard...
Disappear, Fairy Tail!
I'll build it up again from scratch!
It won't lose to anyone! Everyone will cower in fear before my ultimate guild!
That's...
Why, you...
How could you?
Fairy Law is invoked!
That time we laughed, saying we're both like each other,
we even kindly overlooked the little lies.
If we lose a place to go back to together, I don't care.
Because I'll protect that smile.
The meetings and partings numerous as the stars in the sky...
All the things I don't want to lose...
Right now I feel like I don't need any of them.
I just want to see you by my side,
all my happiness and sadness.
Let's start from here.
Let's start our tomorrow.
Let's do it like we've just been reborn.
Like flowers blown in a summer wind,
let us bloom brightly in this instant.
