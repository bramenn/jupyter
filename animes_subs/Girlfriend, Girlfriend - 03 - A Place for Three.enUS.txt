Our life of two-timing cohabitation is off to a start.
Right off the bat, Saki-san had suspicions about me.
I saw things I shouldn't have seen, and I locked myself in the bathroom for hours.
But living with Naoya-kun makes me really happy.
To stay together, we have to keep our relationship a secret at school.
Secret Two-Timing
I have to pretend Naoya-kun and Saki-san are strangers...
But I accidentally made lunch for the three of us.
We can't even eat together...
We shouldn't be acting like strangers just so that we can keep our secret.
Yeah.
The roof gets crowded.
Let's eat together up here in secret.
Okay.
Quietly, so no one notices us.
You don't have to do that for me.
Don't worry about it.
But Naoya-kun already offered to date both of us.
I'm happy enough as it is.
Wouldn't expecting us to have fun together at school be asking for too much?
W-Would it?
Did you hear something?
Shoot!
Besides, you made this lunch because you wanted to eat with us at school, right?
W-Well...
M-Minase-san...
You're too modest!
Pipe down!
Anyway, isn't that true?
It's true that eating lunch together...
Delicious!
Yeah!
I'm so glad!
Let's eat together!
Is someone up there?
You're not allowed up there.
Shoot! Let's bounce!

A Place for Three
Let's find a place to have lunch together.
But I was the one who made the lunch without even asking.
Never mind that!
Yeah!
Let us do this for you!
Naoya-kun, Saki-san...
Where's a good spot?
Hey...
I know of a quiet place at school.
You do?
I spent a lot of time alone in middle school.
What is this sad information?!
L-Let's check it out.
Right!
What do you think?
It's a restroom!
It stinks!
Well, a little.
Not just a little!
I can't eat in a place like this!
B-But...
The cleaners don't come to the schoolyard restroom often,
and no one uses it during lunch.
That's nasty!
Isn't there anywhere else?
Th-Then...
Behind the restroom?
It still stinks!
I'm getting both male and female restroom stank!
I thought it might be less dirty than inside.
Eek! And there are creepy bugs!
H-How about somewhere that doesn't smell?
O-Okay.
How about here?
It's still a restroom!
The club building restrooms are relatively clean.
I don't think they smell much, either.
But it's still a restroom!
Also, Naoya, what are you doing, coming into the girls' restrooms?
I-I-It's to eat lunch with you guys.
Sheesh! Get out!
Oh, be careful when you go in or out.
I swear...
What do you think they were doing in the restroom?
I wonder...
I-It's not what you think!
Saki-chan...
Please take me somewhere that isn't a restroom.
In that case, there aren't any safe places.
There must be plenty of other places!
I know. How about the gym storage room?
That might work!
There are more people there than in the restrooms.
It'll be fine. People don't go there during lunch.
But no one would come in while you're in the restroom.
Could you stop comparing it to the restroom?!
Sorry.
B-But I don't want people
finding out about our relationship just to satisfy my selfishness.
Nagisa-chan...
That's not being selfish.
But even if it is, that's okay, too.
Whatever it is, let's first see if we can do it.
It might turn out to be easy.
Even if it's hard, we'll figure it out!
A-Are we really eating in the gym storage?
Sure!
It's locked, though.
I have no choice!
The window's open over here.
You can stand on me to get in.
O-Okay!
How is it?
My eyes!
No looking at her panties!
Okay, we're in.
And now, with this...
We can hide when someone comes in.
Oh, five centimeters to the right.
Saki-san?
Yeah, this seems good.
Naoya-kun...
Minase-san,
this relationship started with my own selfishness.
There'll be a ton of problems, but I'll work to deal with them.
I don't have any regrets.
I'm just glad I get to be with you, Minase-san.
Naoya-kun...
I'm definitely the one being the most selfish and causing the most trouble
by dating both of you.
No kidding!
Nagisa-chan's selfishness is cute by comparison.
That's true.
Sorry.
Thanks, though.
I want to eat with the three of you.
Okay, let's eat.
Okay.
Time to eat.
I'm stealing your rolled eggs!
Saki-chan?
Yum!
Nagisa-chan's lunches are the best.
I'm glad you like it.
It's delicious, Minase-san.
This is such a weird situation, huh?
It's fun, though.
I mean, it's not not fun.
Saki-chan...
Yes.
I look forward to doing this more often.
It's so dusty in here, though.
Let's clean up sometime.
Should we bring snacks?
I'll work hard on lunch, too.
Happiness...
Yummy lunch...
Girlfriend, Girlfriend
Bliss...
Omelet rice lunch!
Cutlet sandwiches!
Holy!
Tempura rice ball lunch!
Nagisa-chan always makes the most intricate lunches.
I wanted to make Naoya-kun happy.
You're so adorably selfless!
S-Saki-san...
I need to try to make you both happy, too.
No, not at all.
Is there anything more you'd like me to do?
No, you're already doing too much.
No, I want to do more for you.
If you need money, I'll do any kind of work!
Any kind of work?
Nagisa-chan...
It's fine.
But if it comes to that,
I'll take part in sketchy clinical trials or work on a tuna boat!
You, too, Naoya! That's enough!
Sheesh.
Nagisa-chan sure does like Naoya, huh?
Saki-chan...
I'm sorry I made you feel left out.
Huh?
Uh, n-no...
I think I've been getting complacent.
I'll tell you what I like about you every day!
I never asked for that much!
B-But tell me one thing a day.
All right.
Lucky...
I'll tell you, too, Minase-san!
My point is...
You must really like him to work so hard for him.
You do, too, don't you?
Huh? Well...
I think I'm doing a decent amount for Naoya, too.
More, please!
Okay!
I suck at doing the chores.
I'll take care of it.
I'm in heaven!
Wait...
Saki-chan?
I haven't been doing shit.
A-Am I in trouble as a girlfriend?
Between Nagisa-chan, who's cute and devoted and big-boobed...
and me, who does nothing...
Naoya's going to fall more in love with Nagisa-chan than with me.
Two-timing is bad, huh?
It is.
Naoya!
The End
Saki-san?
I can't!
S-Saki-chan?
I gotta keep up with Nagisa-chan!
Girlfriend, Girlfriend
Huh? Sakisaki?
Sorry, I'm skipping club today! Thanks!!
I have to think.
What do I want to do for Naoya?
What would make him happy?
***s always please a man
Put on a ***y ***
I can only think of sexy things.
Let him squeeze your ***s
Gently touch his ***
*** his ***
Naoya!
Saki-chan!
I was worried. You suddenly disappeared.
Never mind that!
Naoya, is there anything you want me to do?
No. In fact, is there anything you want me to do?
Huh? No...
Should I buy cake or something?
Cake?
I want cake!
I bought some cake.
Yum!
I made some tea.
Thanks...
Wait, this is wrong!
I'm just going to have to compete against Nagisa-chan in cooking.
I'll make something fancy.
Sparkling Deliciousness!
Sparkling Deliciousness!
Sparkling Deliciousness!
I've been wanting to try these!
I'm home.
What did you buy?
Gummies!
Wait, I didn't buy cooking ingredients!
Whatever! I'll just feed him some curry!
You just have to chop stuff up and toss it in the pot, right?
Now I just wait.
I'll watch some videos or something.
3 Hours Later
Let's give it a shot.
Yay! I got an SSR!
Yay!
Thanks, everyone!
A-All these donations...
Her evil boobs are making a killing!
It's burnt!
I'm sure burnt curry is good, too.
H-He's right.
What if I'm actually a bad girlfriend?
What if Naoya actually... goes for Nagisa-chan?
I'm out of options.
TUE
S-Saki-chan!
We're doing it!
Doing what?!
What else would you do in this situation?!
W-Wait, Saki-chan...
I thought we promised not to do these kinds of things.
You want to, though, don't you?
I'll keep it a secret for you.
H-How's that, Naoya?!
Can you stop yourself now?
Saki-chan...
We can't.
I can't lie like that to Minase-san.
Let's not.
I'll hear you out if there's something on your mind.
U-Um...
How can you be so calm?
I-Is it because my boobs are so small?!
Do you prefer Nagisa-chan's giant boobs?!
Saki-chan!
Saki-chan! What's wrong?
Saki
Saki-chan...
Wait!
S-Saki-chan!
I'm going home
Saki
I'm going home.
Neighbors
Do you prefer Nagisa-chan's giant boobs?!
Girlfriend, Girlfriend
Do you want Nagisa-chan's giant boobs?!
Huh?!
Huh!?
Naoya-kun, is something wrong?
Minase-san...
Saki-chan left home.
She left? Why?
She asked me if I prefer your huge boobs.
I don't get it!
Wait, if Saki-chan left home...
Does that mean I'm living with Naoya-kun by myself?
Is this the beginning of our life together?
Kiss me.
Sorry to worry you.
I'll make sure Saki-chan and I make up.
Right, of course.
She's not replying to my messages. And it's late at night.
I'll try talking to her in the morning.
O-Okay.
It's my chance to be alone with Naoya-kun.
But if I'm thinking of Naoya-kun...
Is there anything I can do?
Thanks.
But I have to solve this.
So...
I'm not going to rest or sleep until we make up!
Please don't put yourself in danger!
Saki-chan must be worried about my relationship with two girls.
Are you really...
I'm going to stay up all night to write a love letter to her!
Could I at least make you a nutritious meal?
Saki-chan!
Let me talk to you, please!
Saki-chan!
Shut up! Don't talk to me!
Then read this letter I wrote for you!
So heavy!
I'm not reading that!
Fine...
My Feelings for Saki-chan: Chapter One!
My love is...
Don't read it out loud!
Naoya-kun...
I'm not done yet.
I'll give you 100,000 yen worth of gacha pulls from the game you like!

I used my savings!
If you talk to me, I'll give you my account.
Ten pulls, twenty pulls, thirty pulls...
Oh, your money...
There, I did them all!
Wait...
Not a single five-star!
Don't expect to buy me off like that!
That didn't work.
You're going too far.
Saki-chan! Saki-chan!
You're disturbing the neighbors!
I bought cakes from a bunch of popular cake shops.
Let's talk properly!
I-I don't want any!
You should take a break.
Saki-chan... Saki-chan...
I went all over town and took a ton of cute cat and dog videos.
Th-There are plenty of those online!
Were you up all night again?
Saki-chan... Saki-chan...
I organized my notes... from class... for you.
I have zero interest in that.
Seriously, take a break!
Saki-chan...
Saki-chan...
Sa... Saki-chan...
Please...
T-Talk to me...
You haven't slept for three days.
Jeez!
Go have fun with big-boobs Nagisa-chan.
I-I see...
You're worried about your breast size.
W-Well... Not really!
That doesn't bug me!
My private account on Quitter!
There are all sizes!
You don't have to do that!
Gross.
Next...
Naoya-kun!
Please, you're going to collapse.
Please.
Take a break.
Naoya-kun...
I'm all right.
A-Am...
Am I not good enough?
I'll make every day fun, even without Saki-san.
I'll do anything for you, Naoya-kun.
I'm honored that you feel that way about me.
But I decided that if I'm going to go out with both of you,
I won't give up on either one of you.
Sorry.
Minase-san?
It's not fair.
That's what I like about you, Naoya-kun.
Minase-san...
All right, fine.
Let me do what I can, too.
Saki-san! Saki-san!
What?
W-W-Wait!
M-Minase-san?!
You...
Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you doing?!
Now you can talk!
Minase-san...
Sh-Shoot!
Good luck.
All right!

A Girlfriend's Two Choices!
What's your favorite season? Summer? Winter?
Summer, for sure.
Because there's summer break!
It's not one of the two choices, but I'd say spring.
That was the season when I met Naoya-kun.
This girl's lobbing some huge foreshadowing into the preview!
