He's gotten stronger again.
He's shining even more brilliantly than before.
But there's a smudge that's getting in my way.
He'll get strong.
Someday, he'll be strong enough to be rid of it.
But...
This shell can only be broken by those who go on adventures.
I'll leave this in your hands, Ottarl.
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?
Aiz Wallenstein Sword Princess
Bell-sama!
Sorry, I didn't mean to...
You surprised me!
I had no idea you used a transformation spell.
Yes.
So unless they know about this ability, no one can recognize me now.
If they don't see me for a while, they'll probably think I died in the dungeon.
I see.
But are you okay with that?
Yes. As long as you know who I am, Bell-sama,
that's enough for me.
More importantly,
are you okay with this?
I was tricking you!
I took advantage of your kind heart and betrayed you.
If you just forgive me like this, I'll...
Don't worry about me.
Come on, let's go.
My name is Liliruca Arde.
Nice to meet you.
So you're the supporter I've heard so much about.
Bell-kun told me all about you.
I'll go make some tea downstairs.
Oh, but we only have two cups.
Oh, there's no need to worry about that!
You and I can use the same cup!
I guess even you tell jokes like that, Goddess.
Oh...
First...
Let's hear your resolve.
Miss Supporter, can you swear you'll never make the same mistake again?
Yes. I swear.
To Bell-sama, to you, and more than anything, to myself.
He saved me.
I'll never betray him again.
I don't want to.
Understood.
I believe you.
I'll be honest, Miss Supporter.
I don't like you.
Of course I don't!
You were lying to Bell-kun about so much,
and now you're trying to win him over.
I really don't like you.
What's with that glum look, anyway?
Let me guess: Bell-kun was too nice,
and refused to blame you at all,
so now you're being crushed by your guilt, right?
In my opinion, you're just being selfish.
All right.
I'll judge you in Bell-kun's place.
Please watch over Bell-kun.
Keep an eye on Bell-kun so he won't get scammed by any more weirdos.
Just so we're clear, this isn't for your sake.
After this, I'm sure of that if I don't do something,
Bell-kun will just get tricked by someone again!
And in the end, guilt is just the question
of whether you're capable of forgiving yourself or not.
If you've really changed, then prove it with your actions.
Hestia-sama...
I'll let you into the party.
And I'm leaving you in charge of babysitting him.
But!
I'm back!
Be sure of one thing. Know your place
Sorry I'm lat
G-Goddess?
So once more, hello there, Miss Supporter.
I hear you've been very good to my Bell-kun.
You've joined this race way too late.
So keep your hands off my Bell-kun!
You thieving beast!
Oh, not at all. Bell-sama is always nice to me, too!
I'll rise to any challenge for Bell-sama, even a Goddess!
Yeah, I'm not going to lose!
G-Goddess? Lili?
That's right! I need to go to Eina-san and meet the guild!
Bell-kun!
Bell-sama!
It's your fault Bell-kun ran off!
What? You were doing the exact same thing
I'm glad.
Bell-kun!
Bell-sama!
Um... where's Eina-san?
Bell-kun?
Bell-kun?
What?
Excuse me.
Oh, the Sword Princess.
What are you doing, Bell-kun?
It's rude to just run off like that.
I'm sorry, but um... um...
Why... how...
Miss Wallenstein wants to talk to you, she says.
You were being attacked by orcs in the dungeon earlier, weren't you?
Y-Yes. How did you know?
This was lying on the ground after you left.
I wanted to give it back.
Then you're the one who saved me?
I've been wanting to apologize.
You were hurt because I let that minotaur escape.
I'm sorry.
N-No!
It's not your fault at all, Wallenstein-san.
Actually, you're the person who saved my life.
Actually, I'm the one who needs to apologize,
because I kept running instead of apologizing.
I'm sorry.
You're working hard at dungeon exploration, aren't you?
It's amazing that you made it to the 10th floor so quickly.
No, that's not true.
I have to get stronger,
but I have a long way to go.
I'm no better than a beginner at fighting,
and I can't get anywhere towards reaching my goal.
I'm no good, and... um... um...
There's no one who can teach you how to fight?
N-No...
Then...
Want me to teach you?
Um, so Wallenstein-san...
Aiz.
Yes?
Call me Aiz.
Everyone does.
Would that bother you?
Not at all!
A-Aiz-san...
B-By the way, um...
What should I do for training?
What should we do?
I've been thinking ever since yesterday about what we should do, but...
Your weapon is a knife, isn't it?
Do you use kicks or martial arts?
N-No...
Let me see your knife.
Like this?
Like this?
Like this?
Aiz-san... are you an airhead?
Um, I think we should go over...
She really is an airhead.
Sorry.
No... it's not your fault.
Let's fight after all.
That's right.
How you responded there.
Be sensitive to different things in the battle.
If you are, you'll learn to fight whether you want to or not.
You're a coward, aren't you?
I think it's important to be a coward in order to protect yourself.
But you're afraid of something besides that.
Don't lose focus.
Don't create blindspots.
Keep an eye on everything around you.
Your skills and strategy are lacking.
Can you stand?
P-Please let me try again!
Not enough.
This won't be enough to fulfill their orders.
You look a little tougher.
Now, then...
Excellent.
I choose you.
Master this.
Bell-sama, how deep shall we go today?
Oh, since we're taking tomorrow off,
I want to get as deep as we can.
Sorry to make you take a day off for me.
It's not your fault.
You need to find a place to stay, right?
And I have something to do, too.
Bell-sama, why have you been exhausted and beat-up even before
you go into the dungeon lately?
Oh, well...
Get back, Lili!
Yes, Bell-sama!
Lili!
Keep an eye on everything around you.
Don't create blindspots.
Bell-sama, that was amazing!
This looks a little rough.
Shall we run away for now and regroup?
No.
If I keep being scared, I'll never catch up to her!
I want to catch up to her, no matter what!
Stand.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry...
I passed out again.
Can I ask you something?
Why are you able to get so strong, so fast?
I-I'm not strong...
I just... well...
There's a person I want to catch up to,
and a place I want to reach, no matter what.
That's why, I think.
I see.
I understand. It's the same for me.
Let's practice afternoon naps.
In a dungeon, you need to be able to fall asleep anywhere, at any time.
Um... are you...
Sleepy, maybe?
It's part of your training.
Yes.
You're not going to sleep?
I am!
E-Excuse me...
So fast!
I-Is that the power of a first-rate adventurer?
Go, Bell! A real man always goes after women in their sleep!
Kiss her!
G-Grandpa!?
It's the height of impropriety to not do anything in this situation.
That girl is waiting expectantly for you to do something!
Wait, Bell-kun!
I didn't raise you to be the kind of boy who goes after women in their sleep!
I'll never let you kiss her!
Now get away!
This is a man's battle now!
Wait.
Wait?
What am I doing?
It's done, then.
Where are we going, Aiz-san?
You seemed hungry. Let's eat something.
No, I'm fine...
Don't worry.
I'm hungry, too.
Two fried potatoes with red bean cream.
With extra cream.
And double extra red beans.
What are you doing?
Goddess!
It's a different one every time with you, damn it!
And now, at last, finally, of all people...
This woman, too?
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
So you're saying it's just two more days, right?
Yes.
It was only going to be until the Loki Familia's next expedition started.
Please, Goddess!
Fine.
If you're that insistent...
Goddess!
But! Wallenwhatsit!
If you try to pull anything with my Bell-kun,
the deal is off. Got it?
Yes.
You're not allowed to try and seduce him, got it?
Huh?
You're not going to get your hands on my Bell-kun, okay?
I got to him first, after all!
Goddess!
Why am I being so bold?
You have a good goddess, don't you?
Yes.
Hey, you there!
Get away from him!
What are you?
What the hell are you doing here?!
