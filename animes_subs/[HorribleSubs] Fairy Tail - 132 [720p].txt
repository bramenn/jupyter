W-What?! Legion?!
Then the ones that attacked us are from Zentopia?
Yeah. I'm positive.
Why would Fiore's largest religious organization attack us?
I don't know, but he said some crap about a crusade...
Who gives a damn about all that?!
Lucy, I swear we'll get that memento back for you!
Yeah.
Don't be so glum.
You were being controlled by magic...
I'm sorry. I couldn't do anything to help...
No, it's not your fault, Michelle.
It's because...
It's because... I was weak...
The church attacks that happened soon before Zentopia's anniversary event...
A mysterious clock hand and a sinister line...
That Legion was after...
I don't like it.
I don't like that they made light of Fairy Tail,
an' I hope we don't let it just end with our asses gettin' kicked...
What happened with the members that were sent in pursuit?
According to Warren, all of the teams lost track of them.
But it's not over. It's just begun...
Now you're talkin'! Now we can look forward to gettin' payback, 100 times over!
Right?!
Yeah!
Key of the Starry Heavens!
The crusade they mentioned...
Legion is trying to accomplish something big...
For that, the clock hand was necessary.
And the words that were inscribed on it...
Time is etched...
and then chaos descends...
What's wrong, Carla?
Nothing. Never mind.
That clock actually exists somewhere...
Do they mean to use it for their crusade?
Chaos descends... My guess it's a reference to that crusade.
Natsu, are you okay? Are you following the conversation?
Oh, shut up!
Then rules are unnecessary here.
That's right up my alley!
Listen, everything works more or less because the world has rules, right?
Like when someone takes something that's not theirs, they're a thief?
Like, lock your door whenever you go out?
All of our freedoms were built upon the foundations of certain rules.
Without them, everything would be pure lawlessness.
Is that what they're trying to achieve with their crusade?
Sounds like things are gettin' crazy again...
In the first place, you can't call robbing someone
of their property an act of holiness.
A clue...
Maybe Legion is looking for another part of the clock now...
If we can find out what their purpose is,
the meaning of the memento will also become clear.
All we can do is investigate. And maybe that'll tell us where they are...
Or maybe they'll notice us sniffing around and come for us.
I like that thinkin'! Let's go!
But where should we start investigating?
I'll try doing a divination.
That should narrow it down at least.
Did you hear that?! That's my daughter!
Yeah, yeah...
I have the update, sir! Nothing out of the ordinary at the two other parishes.
Good work.
Is it possible that another place
besides the three that we supposed will come under attack?
I cannot say for sure.
But from the results of our investigation
of the incidents up to now and the latest divination...
Who's inside?
According to the priest, no one is here at this hour.
Excited! Hot! Rich!
So you're the one...?
Don't think I'll sit quietly and let you do me in, monster!
Please sit quietly and let me do you in!
A scream?!
How can that be?!
Oh, no! Hurry!
Well, well...
The Detention Corps is working hard in the wee hours of the morning...
Are you the one responsible for the string of attacks?!
What is that?!
It's huge!
What the devil are you?!
Well, my name is Jackpot...
Yes, there we go!
Washtubs it is!
Hot!
Totally hot!
On top of that, Rushing Down the Path of Evil!
Oh, yeah! Lightning bonus!
Who is this clown?
Let's go again!
Here it is! Oni Flash!
This is totally hot.
He disappeared!
What was that?!
Was that the serial attacker?!
So it would seem... And his jocular manner makes him all the more fearsome...
So, sorry, but... can we ask you to do it?
Well, I don't mind...
We couldn't ask anyone but you to do somethin' this dangerous.
We'll partner you up with just the right person.
Look at him sneaking around again in the middle of the night...
Oh, don't be so hard on him.
Cana-chan, did you hear that?
A little bit.
How about going with Papa?
What could be better than a father and daughter trip, right?
Why don't you go by yourself?
You're always so mean to me, Cana-chan...
Get going!
See you later!
Why don't you try being a little nicer to him?
You've got to be kidding!
Yeesh... He's so cool when he acts with determination, but...
Tonight, too?
It seems his nightmares become worse by the night...
And sedatives don't work either?
Are you awake?
How do you feel?
Mmm... It was that dream again..
Tonight as well?
Yes... It's a terribly ill-omened dream...
But what is it trying to tell me?
Already, I am afraid to sleep.
But if you don't sleep, it will affect your health.
The anniversary event is also near...
Please summon the cardinals, just in case something happens to me.
Don't talk like that!
In order to lead the people, it sometimes becomes necessary
to make difficult choices.
And that is the duty of the Archbishop of Zentopia.
I kind of remember seeing this before...
It's the Heartfilia mansion.
Was it put up for sale?
It's in good shape, considering seven years have passed.
Then it must be kept up periodically until a buyer is found, huh?
The administrator of the estate says they haven't been able to find a buyer...
Probably because it's too luxurious...
This brings back memories...
I used to think of this as a castle back then...
And it hasn't changed...
Michelle, you've been here before?
We used to play a lot together...
Oh... That's... right...?
Nee-san, you used to make clothes for me...
Right, right... I may have...
Clothes?
She must be better with her hands than I thought.
That's cute.
Although the clothes were made with colored construction paper and flowers...
Oh, jeez...
How do you make clothes with construction paper and flowers?!
Well, think...
Go home!
I'd like to get to the reason we're here. Do you mind?
No objections!
Um... Where should we start?
And what are we supposed to be looking for?
That's the reason I had so many of us come here.
We'll spread out in groups of two and thoroughly search every room.
Look for clock parts, old clocks, anything that reminds you of those words,
books that have something to do with ancient Potamelian, anything...
Examine anything that makes you think, How about this?
There's still a lot of furniture left, huh?
Yeah. I was told that some of it is priceless and some of it is just junk...
What's this?
I think this was done shortly before my mom passed.
I just remember being told to sit like that...
It was hard on me to think about her afterwards...
And I took it out on other people and things...
I think I made everyone worry about me...
Oh...
I just decided! One day, I'm gonna buy this house back!
And then I'll restore it back to the way it was, as much as possible!
Back to... the way it was?
Yeah!
Is something wrong?
No. It's a lovely idea. I think Uncle Jude would be pleased.
I see... My dad...
It's like a library!
This is my father's study.
He collected more books than me.
Maybe...
Hmm...
Easier said than done. With this many books...
To My Daughter...?
Nee-san, look at this!
This is a strange book...
All of the pages are blank.
The title is To My Daughter... and there's no publication data.
Then there's some magic at work on the book...
By the way, Nee-san...
Is he sleeping?
No, he's tuning in.
Old Master Crux should be able to learn something.
Diao!
Well?
Indeed, this is decidedly nothing more than an old bundle of paper.
There's no magic involved, let alone characters written in invisible ink.
Furthermore, your father bound these pages together himself.
I see... Did you learn anything else?
There is one more thing.
From ancient times, there have been certain rules
when it comes to this particular type of riddle.
For example, this title...
What if it's an anagram?
I see!
So we try putting the letters in a different order, right?
I wouldn't know a potential clue if it bit me in the ass!
I'm hungry...
What are you guys playin' a game for?
Natsu-san!
Keep your silence.
We're thinking!
What's that? A puzzle?
We're trying to decipher an anagram.
Anagra...? Oh, that.
Well, it is like a puzzle.
Huh, that looks like fun! Let me...
What do you think you're doing?!
We were trying to think!
Oops.
We were on the verge of getting a flash of inspiration!
Erza-san is serious...
She's the type that really focuses on this kind of thing.
Jeez! You scattered the cards all over the place...
Ah... Is this...
Diao!
Those four letters... Myth, correct?
Myth?
Indeed.
Like an old legend...
I think we're gettin' there.
What can we do with the remaining letters?
Duo... Great... Myth...
That's it! There are two books referred to as The Two Great Myths!
The author is Will Neville.
One book is titled Life of the Clockwork and it's got those words in it!
Is that the book you had in your room, Nee-san?
Uh-huh. What a coincidence!
As for the other myth...
Ta-daa! It's called Key of the Starry Heavens!
Isn't that a picture book?
It's not just any old picture book! It's really magical...
At any rate, doesn't the word key strike you?
Yeah. Maybe there's some kind of hint inside the book.
Like another anagram? I guess it wouldn't be that easy...
But if we look at it from another way, we may be able to learn something...
No...
Carla?
I don't know if it has to do with that clock hand...
And what is that kitty-cat over there holding?
A book about a rabbit and a turtle.
I think this book is really magical, too.
Would you give me that book?
You're after this book?!
That's not really a funny joke.
W-What the hell is that?!
The door handle expanded!
You've got a rather limited power of expression, it seems.
You couldn't say the door handle doubled in size, which broke down the door?
I don't believe it! He's...?!
You mean...
An Exceed! But was this guy in Extalia?
No... I bet he was sent to this world at the same time we were, Happy!
Why, you... Who the hell are you?!
I am the head of Legion...
Samuel.
So you sniffed us out right away and came runnin', huh?
Then give us back the clock hand!
Never.
What?!
Anyway, you've done exactly as I predicted.
I knew you would come here.
And that you would find a clue.
As indeed, you have.
I'm a genius.
That guy's gettin' on my nerves...
We'll have to attack before he gets the chance...
Erza-san!
Right.
Ice Make: Lance!
Victory goes to the one who makes the first move!
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
Wait a...
No!!
What are you doing?!
I just decided to buy this house back!
Hold it! That guy repelled our magic!
I'm the spearhead of Legion...
Dan Straight is here!
Another weirdo...
Did you get a good look at the power of my shield?
Magic shield Ricochet!
It blocks any and all attacks, then scatters them about!
Ricochet... So everything bounces off of it...
Then we can't just attack willy-nilly...
One false move and Lucy will be buying back a mountain of debris!
We got one pain in the ass comin' in after another!
They're going to attack.
No matter how many times they attack, nothing will change!
I'll destroy that thing before it can repel my attack!
I told you to stop it!
Dan, that girl has the book.
Lucy-san!
I'll lure that guy outside!
No! It's too dangerous, Nee-san!
Here's the book! Steal it if you can!
Th-Throb!
You're beautiful!
Throb!
Beautiful! This wizard is too beautiful!
She's shot me right through the heart!
I can't stand it! I can't stand it! She's crushed me!
By the way, what's your name?
Lucy...
Lucy! I can't stand it!
Lu! Cy!
You've touched me to the quick!
Can I call you Lu-tan? Lu-chan? Lu-pi? Lun-lun?
Whatever...
It's begun...
Whatever!
That voice! Those eyes!
That mouth! That hair!
That chest! That waist!
Those legs!
All of it makes my Fibonacci sequence chirp! It spells out...
That's love!
W-What are you talking about?!
Love!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Cut it out! Don't butt in!
Go, Lucy and Michelle. We can't let them take that book!
R-Right!
Everyone, I need you on support. Leave this to me!
I-I think we were overwhelmed by that...
Our brains were at a standstill...
Huh. You've got a lot of confidence in yourself.
You'd do well not to underestimate us.
Let me hit'em, too!
You protect Lucy!
Run, Lucy!
Let's go!
Right!
I'm not done talking to you!
Don't destroy the house!
Hmph.
Alright. Certainly, the framework of this building...
Dan, I'll leave Titania to you.
Okay.
Come on, then!
Even physical attacks bounce off?!
Alrighty!
What?!
What kind of magic is this?!
I heard you scream.
You're pretty cute yourself, but the difference between
you and Lu-tan is greater than the width of an ocean!
What's your deal, jackass?!
Our time is about up. See you again, Titania!
Hey! Wait a second!
What was that?!
It was from the study!
Erza!
Nee-san, we have to hurry!
R-Right...
When did he...?!
Just as I predicted. The answer came forth simply,
based on your mental state and the structure of this abode.
No one wants to hear your mumbling!
Natsu!
Natsu-san!
Bastard!
How dare you do that to Natsu-san?!
Exactly as planned...
Natsu!
Are you okay?!
Son of a bitch!
Wait a second!
Happy! Where's Natsu?!
Is he alright?!
I stepped on him.
He's tiny!
Now, why don't you stop running around?
What did you do to Natsu?!
I'm able to change the size of anything I touch...
So, would you hand over that book without any more fuss?
I don't like to do things Mary's way.
I would prefer to avoid having to get even rougher on you.
What?!
Happy!
Get the book and escape!
Aye, sir!
Hey! Get back here!
Go! Go!
Not clever by half...
The book is right here.
Hey!
He figured it out right away!
How?!
Everything is cause and effect. I can read the calculations.
That's why I can see through everything that you people do.
You can have the book back. I memorized its contents.
Hey...
'Til we meet again, Lu-tan!
Next time, let's go on a date, just the two of us!
Dan... Have you gained weight again?
He left the book here...
Meaning he doesn't see us as any kind of threat.
Condescending bastard...
I swear I'll get them back...
Turn me back to normal!
Turn him back!
Dad...
What are you trying to tell me?
What am I gonna do about this body?!
Natsu, you're gonna be dead weight this time around.
What's that?!
After all, at that size, you can't put out much more fire than a candle, right?
Hmph! If I put my mind to it, I can even barbecue underwater!
Even when you threaten, it just comes off as cute!
Happy, you're gonna get it...
Next time: Traveling Companions!
Huh? Natsu, are you angry?
Of course I am!
Even an angry Natsu is cute...
