A hero...
Hey, villain...
Go beyond!
Plus...
Ultra...!
I really have gotten weaker...
In my prime... five hits would have been enough.
But it took more than 300 hits.
And now...
Now, villains...
I'm sure... we'd all like to end this as soon as possible.
Weaker?
No way.
We've been completely overwhelmed.
I can't believe he did that to my Nomu...
He used a cheat?!
Hands up.
No Quirks allowed.
If you use your Quirks, I'll kill this guy.
Kaminari!
He got us.
We let our guard down completely.
An ambush after they made us think we got all of them.
I can't believe we didn't predict this.
I don't wanna kill someone who's an electric-type, like me,
but I guess I have to, huh?
An electric-type...
He was probably the one Todoroki said was jamming communications.
I'm going over there.
Don't move a muscle.
You and Kaminari...
Huh?
What are you
I mean, even if you aren't a hero, there are a ton of jobs you could do.
You're in great demand, right?
Well, it's just an innocent thought.
I'm just wondering, why is someone like you a villain?
I see.
Jiro can attack without moving as long as she gets her plug in!
It's fine if you don't want to answer.
Give it up.
Did you think I wouldn't notice?
A kid's naive thinking only works on dumb adults.
Novice heroes shouldn't make light of hostages.
If you two don't put up a fight...
Someone else's life...
Now.
Don't move.
Hey, what's going on?
He's not any weaker at all.
Did that guy... lie to me?!
What's wrong?
You're not coming?
You said you'd clear this or something, right?
Come and get me if you can.
All... Might...
As expected.
It looks like there is no need for us to fight.
Midoriya!
We should get out of here now!
It'll be worse if we end up getting taken hostage instead!
No...
He's... bluffing.
It's almost lost under the cloud of dust...
All Might is...!
I can't... move anymore...!
That Nomu thing was too strong...
Frankly...
I'll go back to by true form.
Just a little more...
Well, what's wrong?!
Hesitate!
If I can stall...
If only I had Nomu...!
That guy...
Shigaraki Tomura!
Please calm yourself.
Looking carefully...
Looking carefully... I see that he was definitely weakened
I see he was damaged by Nomu's attacks...
from the damage of Nomu's attacks.
Besides...
We still have underlings who can be used.
There are likely only a few minutes left before reinforcements come.
If you and I work together...
we still have a chance of killing him.
Yeah...
Yeah, yeah...
That's right...
You're right.
Right.
We have no choice but to do it.
I mean, we have the last boss right in front of our eyes.
All Might will do something about the main bad guys.
Let's go help the others!
Midoriya?
I'm the only one who knows...
The mist guy is probably more dangerous.
All Might has most likely...
If the mist guy toys with him...
You're coming, huh?!
This is revenge for Nomu!
Jeez, holy shit!
Hurry!
Everyone... hurry!
He s fast!
I'm the only who knows the predicament he's in!
Midoriya!
They're broken... even though I controlled it earlier...
But... I made it!
The hidden part of his body!
As long as I aim at that...
Get away from All Might!
This hand is...
I won't fall for that again!
They here?!
This attack...
Could it be...?
Sorry, everyone!
Sorry we're late!
I gathered all who were immediately available!
Iida!
I, class 1-A representative...
Split up and protect the students!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Aw man, they're here.
It's game over now.
Shall we go home and try again later, Kurogir?
Someone whose Quirk can capture them all from this distance...
Shigaraki Tomura!
This is...
I may have failed this time...
What the pros deal with...
What they fight against...
The world of evil...
That was an experience... that we were not ready for yet.
I wasn't able...
That's not true.
If it weren't for those few seconds you bought me,
I would have been killed.
You saved me again.
All Might...
I'm so glad...
My goodness...
I can't believe we let them escape after they made such a big show of trespassing.
They caught us completely unguarded, huh?
More importantly, we must make sure the students are safe.
If this many pro heroes have gathered here...
Midoriya!
Oh, Kirishima...
Are you all right?
Young Kirishima...
But wait, he'll find out!
Crap! Wait! Damn it!
K-K-Kirishima, wai!
We want to make sure that all the students are safe...
We will deal with the injured here.
That makes sense.
Roger that!
Hey, he said to gather in front of the gate!
Thanks
You saved me, Cementoss.
I am a fan of yours, too.
Cementoss!
Quirk: Cement!
He can manipulate the cement he touches like clay!
He's super strong in modern society!
Let's get you to the nurse's office while keeping you hidden.
But man, you act recklessly every time, huh?
If I didn't act recklessly, I would have been killed.
That was how strong the enemy was.
Ouch...
I was shot in both arms and both legs...
We lost completely...
Even Nomu was defeated!
All the underlings were defeated in an instant!
Those kids were strong...
The Symbol of Peace was healthy...
You were wrong, Master!
No, I wasn't.
We were just not prepared enough.
Yes, we underestimated them.
It's good that we did it under that cheap League of Villains name.
By the way...
He was not retrieved?
He was blown away.
What?!
More precisely, without coordinates to his precise location...
I did not have time for that.
After all we did to make him as powerful as All Might!
Well, I suppose it cannot be helped.
That's unfortunate.
Power...
That's right.
There was one child who was as fast as All Might.
Oh?
If he hadn't gotten in the way...
That brat...!
Brat!
Of course you have regrets.
But this was not a futile exercise.
Gather the elite.
Take all the time you need.
We cannot move freely, which is why we need a symbol, like you.
Shigaraki Tomura.
Next time, show the world that you are to be feared.
Other than the boy with both legs seriously injured, everyone else seems unharmed.
Ojiro.
I heard you were fired up this time.
You were strong by yourself, huh?
I thought everyone was by themselves.
I survived by using hit-and-run tactics.
Where were you, Hagakure?
In the landslide area!
Todoroki was super strong.
I was surprised!
Anyway, I'm glad you weren't hurt.
I almost froze her...
That was close.
Where, do you think...
I see...
So the people you fought were also just hooligans?
They underestimated us'cause we were kids.
Where-
So it was All Might who put the hole in the dome after all?
That's some crazy power.
Yeah, as expected.
Where do you think I was?!
Where?
It's a secret!
Let's have the students return to their classroom for now.
We won't be questioning them right away, anyway, right?
Detective, what about Mr. Aizawa?
Comminuted fractures in both arms and a facial fracture.
Fortunately, there does not seem to be any serious brain damage.
However... his orbital floor had broken into small pieces...
That's what he said.
Ribbit...
No...
What about Thirteen?
Thirteen has been treated.
The laceration from the back to upper arm was bad,
but his life is not in danger.
All Might will also survive.
Recovery Girl's healing is enough to treat him...
Deku...!
What about Midoriya?!
Midori...?
Oh, treatment in the nurse's office is enough for him, too.
Oh, good...
Now, go back to your classroom.
Okay.
Okay.
Sansa, I also have some business in the nurse's office.
I'll leave the rest to you.
Yes, sir!
It's a cat.
Not a dog, huh?
Tch!
Bakugou, he said to go back to the classroom!
I know, bastard!
We need to make some drastic improvements to school security, don't we?
Yes.
A warp Quirk is already very rare...
Detective Tsukauchi!
We received word that someone thought to be a villain was captured in a grove of trees on school grounds.
How is it?
He has no apparent injuries and seemed docile, not resisting capture.
He does not respond even when called out to, so he is thought to be mute.
Principal...
Of course!
Some people might complain, but you police have more authority.
Investigating is what you're good at.
I'm counting on you!
Teams, proceed with the investigation of the school!
Because of the situation this time, I can't really scold you...
I'm not sure...
I hope I still have at least an hour...
All Might...
Well, it can't be helped.
These things happen.
Excuse me.
All Might, it's been a while.
Tsukauchi!
You're here, too?
All Might!
Is it all right to show that form...?
Yeah, it's fine.
Why?
Because he's Naomasa Tsukauchi, my best friend in the force.
What's with that introduction?
Sorry to cut to the chase, but All Might, can you give me details about the vill
Wait! Please, wait!
More importantly, are all the students okay?
What about Aizawa Eraser Head and Thirteen?
Other than that boy, only a few students had light injuries...
I see.
If you three heroes had not risked your lives...
You're wrong about one thing, Tsukauchi.
The students also fought... and risked their lives.
All Might...
Experience a real fight so soon..
Have there even been any first-years who experienced a real fight so soon,
survived, and learned of fear and the world of adults?
have there been such first-years before?
The villains did something dumb.
This class is strong.
They will become strong heroes.
I am certain of that.
Well then, thank you very much!
Sure.
Be careful on your way home.
Yes.
The attack on USJ by the League of Villains...
Deku!
But...
I had no way of knowing that at the time.
It doesn't matter, as long as I get to the top!
I will refuse him completely.
I'm gonna go for it with everything I have, too!
