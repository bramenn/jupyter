Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
Our guild was attacked by the official guild Phantom Lord.
Fairy Tail has never gotten along well with them, but...
They beat up Levy's team and kidnapped Lucy!
So an all-out confrontation began!
That's right, we can do it!
Let's go for even more who-knows-what!!
The door to mystery is right in front of us
The whole world's a wonderland
which we're already wondering!!!
This excitement gets my heart racing
It's wonderful!
Who am I, I wonder?
What is real, I wonder?
Why can't I see tomorrow, I wonder?
The only part leveling up is my curiosity
We can't just throw away our daily life together, right?
Tell me! S. O. W.
Living itself will be our training!
So, we can make it!
Let's search for even more who-knows-what!
We can't be satisfied with just the normal answers
This magical wonder life
Our future is wondering!!!
We'll do our best living our life
the way we want to!
Let's wondering!!!
Fairy Tail!
Lucy Heatfilia!
Card Magic!
Lighting, Reverse Tower, Lovers!
Jolt of Fate!
Ring Magic...
Twister!
Man! Man!
If you're a man, then you're a Man!
I don't get it.
What's with that arm?
It's a Take Over!
His arm's Taken Over by a monster...
That's Elfman!
The one who absorbs the power of monsters he defeats into his arm...
That's...
Beast Arm Elfman!
That's...
It's him...
The Iron Dragon Slayer...
Iron Gajeel!
How dare you hurt Levy!
Nab!
He even took out his own guildmates in that hit!
Hey there, Trash.
The Iron Dragon Slayer, Gajeel the Great, will face you now.
Man!
Maybe I'm trash, but I'm a Man!
Elfman, huh?
Not bad.
A Man must be strong.
Then how about this?
Damn him... His own comrades?
Where do you think you're lookin'?
Gajeel!!
Gajeel was blown backwards!
I've never seen that before...
I'm Fairy Tail's Dragon Slayer.
Elfman, give this guy to me.
Why, you... Not only do you use me as a floor mat,
you plan on interfering in our Man-on-Man battle?
Pillar of the Iron Dragon!
Natsu!
This guy busted up the guild and hurt Levy and the others...
Eat this!
Ooh, they're havin' fun, aren't they?
Must be nice being young.
Excellent.
Natsu! I'll let you have that manly battle!
But in return...
Right! I'll knock him good!
That didn't affect me.
Doesn't look like that to me.
You sure?
Hey, now...
That's just nuts.
Come on, bring it. You're not affected either, right?
You know me pretty good there...
You're one hot and uncomfortable guy, you know that?
Shut up, you hard-ass.
I'll crush you!
Don't get ahead of yourself, you scrap-iron bastard!
Oh? Just as the rumors say... That's some decent power you got there.
Ouchy, ouchy...
So? Is that all you got, Salamander?
Don't worry'bout that.
This was just a greeting.
Before our Dragon's fight!
Heavy...
Now I'm fired up!
Got a bit of a destructive streak in you, huh?
Oh, jeez...
It's started.
This ain't good.
What's going on?
That's master Makarov's anger.
The Giant's Wrath...
No one can stop him now.
The entire guild is shaking!
That's the Man, Master Makarov!
Prepare yourselves! As long as our master is here, we cannot lose!
Jose!
Well, well...
What is the meaning of this?
Answer me!
It has been a while, Makarov-san.
Not since the regular meeting six years ago?
I'm afraid I made a fool of myself then.
Liquor really does me in.
I did not come here to chat, Jose!
You're just a thought-projection?
Damn you! You ran from the guild?
A battle between two of the 10 Great Wizard Saints would surely cause a cataclysm.
I would prefer a simple, sensible victory.
Where are you?
Come and fight me fair and square!
Lucy?
Why?
Why, you ask?
Even though she's part of your own guild?
You're saying you have no idea who Lucy Heartfilia-sama is?
Don't!
Damn! I never sensed this guy's presence!
The, the, the sadness!
What's this?
Something fell down!
The sadness is too great!
Where does this sadness come from?
Is it the sadness of a great wizard disappearing?
What the heck?
My power... I've lost my power!
My magic...
Gramps!
Gramps!
Master!
The sadness...
Yes.
This is the magic of one of the Element 4, Aria-san of the Heavens.
He can empty his opponent of magic.
In other words, his magic is to nullify.
This battle is already mine, wouldn't you say?
M-My magical power..
My magical power!
Master, hang in there!
What's happened?
What in the world? I can't sense any magical power at all from him!
You mean he's now nothing but a little old man?
But, why?
Gramps, get it together!
Well, this is boring. And right when things were heating up.
I can't believe it... How did they beat Gramps?
What the hell do they have up there?
Their master's been beaten?
Seriously?
Hey!
Did you hear that?
We can do this!
They're at less than half strength now!
And we've still got Gajeel and the Element 4!
This is bad...
Now's our chance! Crush them!
Don't get cocky!
Damn it, they've...
Take this! Triple Element Combination Magic!
No!
Cana!
You gotta do better than that!
Macao...
You fool! Don't force yourself at your age!
Don't call me old!
I can see where this is going.
This is bad. It's not just about attacking strength...
Our moral is critically low as well.
Retreat!
Everyone return to the guild!
Erza!
You've got to be kidding me!
A Man does not withdraw!
I can still fight...
I can fight as well, Erza!
No! Without the master, we cannot defeat Jose!
Retreat!
That's an order!
Oh? Already running with your tails between your legs?
You never had the guts, you Fairies.
Retreats are sad.
All too sad!
Aria? You're always creeping me out.
But anyway, good job getting the old man.
It was all Master Jose's plan.
H-How wonderful!
Don't cry at every little thing! You're annoying...
So, did they catch Lucy?
It is a sad story.
The girl named Lucy is being held in our headquarters.
What?
What's the matter, Natsu?
Gajeel!
We'll finish this one day, Salamander!
They caught Lucy...
Retreat!
Move it!
Are you a fool?
You think I'd retreat now?
I'm here to get revenge for Levy's team!
Please...
Erza...
All we can do now... is pull back...
The hole the master left is too great!
It's Salamander... and a cat!
Hey, you...
You and me are gonna talk!
Natsu, what are you going to do?
I'm going to save Lucy, obviously.
Tell me.
Where is Lucy?
H-H-How would I know? Who is that?
It's hot! It's hot! I'm burning!
Say it.
I don't know nothin', seriously!
It's hot!
If any more of my friends are hurt...
You'll be nothing but a pile of ashes...
I never heard of the wench!
I mean, I don't know about the young lady!
Oh, that so? Too bad.
Time to make charcoal, I guess.
Aye!
But our headquarters is up ahead. She may be there...
Say that in the first place, sheesh.
Aye.
What is... Where am I?
Awake, are we? Lucy Heatfilia-sama...
Who are you?
I am the guild master of Phantom Lord, Jose.
Phantom?
That's right! I was captured by the Element 4!
I know that this filthy cell and shackles are quite rude of me,
but you are you currently a prisoner, so I hope you understand the circumstances.
Remove these at once!
Prisoner? How dare you do that to Levy-chan's team!
What's that supposed to mean?
Ew, ew, ew!
See? You don't want to stay in this cell, yes?
If you cooperate, I'll transfer you to the suite.
Why did you attack us?
Us?
Oh, are you referring to Fairy Tail?
Just in passing... A side effect.
Our true objective was to obtain a certain someone.
And that someone just happened to be in Fairy Tail, so we crushed it on our way... That's all.
Someone?
Oh, my...
You're much denser than I figured the daughter of the Heartfilia family would be.
I mean you, of course.
The Daughter of the Heartfilia Konzern, Mistress Lucy.
How did you know?
It seems you hid this fact from the people of the guild.
Why would the daughter of one of the wealthiest families in the country
take on such cheap, dangerous jobs?
Is this a kidnapping?
Oh, no... Nothing of the sort.
We were requested to bring you back with us.
By none other than your father himself.
No... No way!
Why would he?
I'm sure it's because he wanted to search for his beloved daughter who ran away from home.
Quite normal.
No way...
He's not the kind of person that'd care about that!
I'm never going back, you hear me?
I'm not going back to that house!
Oh, my... What a troublesome little lady we have ourselves.
Release me this instant!
I cannot do that.
Because...
I kinda need to go to the bathroom.
Oh, what's this? That's the oldest trick in the book.
No... Seriously...
Please, help...
Fine then.
Go ahead.
No way!
There are plenty of ways to deal with that old trick.
A bucket, huh?
Wait, seriously?!
I've never seen such an improper lady!
And I am a gentleman!
It's best not to underestimate the old tricks!
Then, take care.
Too bad for you...
This is a sky cell!
You did me a good one there...
Now, come to me!
I'm going to punish you.
I must show you how scary Phantom can be!
I heard his voice!
He's here, I know it!
Natsu!
Lucy!
Lucys are falling from the sky!
You're nuts, you know that?
Natsu... I thought you were here...
You okay?
Yeah... Somehow...
Thank goodness. Let's go back to the guild.
What? This is the headquarters... We should-
But Erza said to retreat!
She's scared!
I ain't afraid of them at all!
The master's been severely wounded!
I'll pay'em back for that too!
You can't handle it by yourself, Natsu.
What did you say?
You can't handle it!
Don't say it twice!
Everyone's injured!
Not me!
Nab broke his arm...
Because he's weak...
Even Macao!
'Cause he's an old geezer!
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
This is all... This is all my fault!
But, I still want to be in the guild...
I love Fairy Tail!
Hey, what's the matter? What is it?
Lucy...
Sure you can be in the guild. What's the problem?
Natsu, let's go back.
Uh, okay...
I guess so...
Lucy, come on, stand up.
Don't pull her so much.
Then I'll carry you on my back,'kay?
Now you're making Natsu cry!
No, I'm not!
Now you've gone and done it, girly!
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
chasing after your profile left only in my revolving dreams
You said, I never want to see your face again, when you left me
But the tears on your cheek said it all
Every time you felt like you'd be swallowed up in the waves of contradiction
you always held back your tears, you know?
What a strong person, they said, but everyone overestimated you
and before you knew it you lost sight of who you really are
Then the sun I thought would always be near me collapsed
and the light shut off...
Rubbing out the truths and the lies of one day, altogether
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
still, ironically, chasing after your profile in my revolving dreams
He's late. It's way past the time we were going to meet.
Hey Happy, early are you?
No! You're late, Natsu! What were you doing?
Huh? But my stomach told me this was just about the right time.
You tell time by your stomach?
Next time: 15 Minutes!
I'm pretty peaked, let's get something to eat!
What about my shopping?
Fish are on sale today...
Where, where, where?!
