Still up?
She's no girlfriend!
Average Sleep: 3hrs/day
But only if you go out with me, Kazuya-kun!
Ruka-chan offered me a deal...
Go out with her.
Huh?
And on Mizuhara's orders, I found myself dating her on a provisional basis.
Weekly Dates
Meanwhile, I stopped seeing Mizuhara completely,
and the frosty winter began to set in.
Now
You have a new message.
Where are you?

You're late
I'm waiting for you

She's no girlfriend.
She's a client!

The terms: two phone calls per day, no leaving her on read,
and always like her tweets!
Gah!!
This gives me no bragging rights,
plus it comes with the fear of having my fake relationship with Mizuhara exposed!
Did I make a deal with the devil?!
No girlfriend could be this scary!
And after all that talk about how important love is,
how could Mizuhara tell me to go out with her?!
I guess I was just a client in her eyes after all.
M-Mizuhara?
What the hell is wrong with me?
I need to find some way to distance myself from Ruka-chan.
Lab and Seminar Wing
College Wing 2
Auditorium Cafeteria
Right now, my college life is on a one-way trip to nowhere.
Did you see the season premiere of Terrace House?
It made me wonder just how many Japanese really want to be a model.
Zoom
Surprise!
Wha...
Ruka-chan?!
Wh-What are you doing here?
Well, you wouldn't contact me, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.
Man, if Kuri happened to see this...
Kazuya-kun?
C-Come with me a sec.
P-Please! Let's try not to let Kuribayashi find out!
Huh? Did I mess something up?
Surely you understand that showing up on campus is bad news!
But I don't think we can keep this hidden forever.
Besides, I was just a rental girlfriend.
Who knows if he even liked me for real?
Th-That's not the issue.
But okay, I understand.
I'm the one who said I was okay with a trial.
It's not like I want to put you on the spot, so I'll stay away.
Th-Thank you!
All that aside...
Wanna go catch a movie this Saturday?
Love Clouds! It's a romance flick!
A-A movie?
Squeeze
Christmas is coming up, too. All couples grow closer in winter!
It's the season for us!
I-I guess I could do a movie.
Really?!
At least there'll be an armrest between us.
Yay!
Hey, could you stop clinging to me?
Please, I know you love it.
Rub Rub
What's the matter, Chizuru?
You're spacing out.
Huh? Sorry, where were we?
We're thinking of having a pajama party for Christmas, the three of us.
Oh, sorry. I have plans over Christmas.
What?!
No way! With a boy?!
Wow! What's he like?! C'mon, tell us!
I-It's not like that!
Okay, okay. We won't pry.
We're used to you being secretive.
But do let us know if you have good news!
Jeez, you two!
That should do it.
What's the plan for Christmas? I'd like to go see some night lights!
I'm going on a trip with family over Christmas. Really sorry.
What? I don't believe you!!
This can't go on all the way to Christmas, or she'll really get the wrong idea!
What? I don't believe you!!
I'm breaking up with you.
I'm breaking up with you.
Just kidding.
I need to distance myself...
Christmas, huh?
Last year, I spent the entire time at home studying for entrance exams.

Here's your gift.
Merry, merry Christmas!
Merry, Merry Christmas!
Oh, I know!
If I make a booking right now, I
Mizuhara
What? She's already booked for Christmas Eve?
Well, she's fairly popular.
And I guess great minds think alike.
She's on top of the charts among rookies, after all.
Come to think of it...
Mizuhara Kamiya Shimizu
Why is she even working as a rental girlfriend?
For money, I guess?
Mwahaha
But she said she wasn't making all that much,
and she's living in this run-down building.
She's not the type to get off on wrapping boys around her finger, either.
Come on.
Well, no point in thinking about it. Time to sleep.
No way I could figure it out...
Man, looks like I'll be spending another Christmas alone...
That's all the end-of-year payments done...
That number's looking awfully low. Lots of it went to Mizuhara.
It's my own fault, though.
Guess I'll have to find a job for real.
Mizuhara?
Look at her all dressed up! So pretty!
Wait, why am I hiding?
Yikes, a date? I didn't want to see her working!
Why am I looking away?
But I have a feeling I shouldn't look...
I can't believe a hottie like that is booking a rental girlfriend, though.
I shouldn't interrupt.
I didn't know why, but a massive doubt crept into my mind at that moment...
An all-too-cruel possibility I'd stumbled upon on that sacred day.
Something I wanted to look away from'cause it'd turn my world upside-down.
At the same time, I was dismayed at myself for not even considering it until then.
Maybe Rental Girlfriend Mizuhara Chizuru has a boyfriend.
It took but a few seconds for those dark thoughts to completely consume my mind.
Rent - a - Girlfriend
What?
Is that her boyfriend?!
Why'd the thought never even cross my mind?
Who ever said a rental girlfriend couldn't have a boyfriend?
Come to think of it, I know nothing about Mizuhara's personal life.
And there's a chance they're dating in secret.
And Mizuhara being single was about as likely as pigs flying to begin with!
Wait, no way!
Mizuhara can't have a boyfriend!
She... can't...
Sorry, I lied about when my last train leaves.
Bad girl. Santa won't come see you this year.
Shall we get going, then?
Yeah!
What'd you do over the weekend, Umi-kun?
Futsal, mostly.
Sounds cool! I wanna try it, too!
I'll call you next time I go. It's really fun.
Yay!
So his name's Umi, huh?
Eco-Friendly
How shady.
I-I'm so sorry!
What am I doing?
If Mizuhara saw me, what would she think?
Is that seriously her boyfriend, though?
There's still a chance he's renting her.
And it'd be mighty deceptive of her to act all affable with clients
while dating a pretty boy in real life...
If I'm gonna date a guy, he's gotta be hot.
Snicker
Would Mizuhara really betray us like that?
That'd be way too cruel!
Go, Kinoshita!
Mizuhara Chizuru
Client Association
Expose Mizuhara Chizuru!
Being that pretty is not an excuse!
I need to do this for the bros!
A movie?
What a trite idea for a date. What is he, some well-adjusted fellow?
Aquarium (Very Trite)
Why would anyone pay to rent her and just watch a movie for two hours, though?
It's really unlikely that this is a rental date, I guess?
Knows a thing or two about rental dates
Lots of people here, huh?
This should be good.
I can't just stand around here!
Now Showing The Redemption of a Twenty-Year-Old
That was too deep for me.
Gloom
Who even was the culprit in the end?
Does she watch stuff like that all the time?
The twilight scene was beautiful!
It was one long cut, and the tension was palpable!
I hear the director insisted on doing it that way.
Really? I'd love to see it one more time!
They're having a jolly good time!
They're getting cozy!
They're on the same wavelength!
Sullen
Wow, she says it's perfect!
Compatibility fortunes?
That's great.
Hey, what do you think of this one?
Oh, looks good.
They're buying gifts for each other?
I've never seen her with such a happy smile...
Look at those two!
They're both gorgeous!
The guy's so hot.
I'd love to have that someday.
They're, like, the ideal couple.
Lucky them!
Rattle
Seriously, what is going on here?!
Has taken more damage than he can handle
I haven't seen them hold hands yet.
Right.
A lovey-dovey couple doesn't need to hold hands.
Their hearts are already linked.
Again...
I told you to write what you want to eat on the whiteboard out front, didn't I?
Sorry, it was a busy morning.
There you go again, all about work all the time.
You can eat your meeting minutes for dinner.
I don't think they'd be very filling.
I bet I'll start craving stew late at night.
Then I'll make some and wait for you.
She's spending the night at his place? They're practically living together?!
I should stop already.
I've seen and heard more than enough.
Now
Kibe Yoshiaki
merry xmas
He sent one again...
This stings, Kibe!
Hurts more than usual this year.
Well, duh, of course she'd have a boyfriend, even if she works as a rental girlfriend.
Mizuhara is really pretty.
I should just go home.
What am I doing?
I followed them all day like a creep.
If they'd found out, I would've been taken to court.
Who do you think you are? That's simply stalking!
We're through now! I want nothing to do with you!
Oh, man, the self-hatred's hitting hard.
Wha... Umi-kun?!
Panic
Stay cool! He doesn't know me!
Whistle
Whistle
Whistle
Whistle
Whistle
Hello? I'm calling about the thing we discussed.
Oh, he's here to make a call.
Is that so? Glad to hear it.
Oh, her? I'm with her now.
Mizuhara? What're they talking about?
She's extremely beautiful, and just as wonderful on the inside.
I-Inside? Inside where?!
She's satisfaction guaranteed for whoever sees her.
Sees her? Satisfaction?
Does he know about her job? But he's sounding awfully aloof about it...
Oh, her outfit?
I'll check her measurements later and text you.
Measurements? Outfit?
This isn't about her job!
What the hell? What the hell has he been talking about?
Yes, it'll be easy.
Where will people see her? A gentleman's club?
Nah, I'm overthinking it.
Mizuhara wouldn't be fooled like that.
But she is too nice for her own good...
Maybe he took advantage of that?
Also, she's learned to let out some very alluring voices recently.
Talk to you later.
That's it. This guy's totally plotting something.
Mizuhara...
Mizuhara!
Jerk...
Mizuhara...
Damn it, I don't know how to go out there!
He's her boyfriend.
What right do I have to poke my nose in their business?
But there's no doubt he's a scumbag.
She's learned to let out some alluring voices, my ass!

You're the key player!
I won't let that guy have his way with our Mizuhara!
Wha...
Wait..
M-Mizuhar
Ow!
Y-You!
Why are you here?!
W-W-W...
W-Weren't you about to kiss just now?
Huh? Kiss?
Why would Umi-kun and I kiss?
He was just about to fix up my earring.
Earring? You weren't gonna kiss?
A-Anyway, he's a scumbag trying to take you, his girlfriend, for a ride!
What? Girlfriend?
What are you talking about?
Huh?
Do you know him, Chizuru-chan?
Uh, w-well, he goes to my college.
I-If he's not your boyfriend, then what?!
Why else would you be on a date with such a pretty boy on Christmas Eve, of all days?!
What?
And you were talking about late-night stew and whatnot!
H-How did you...
Uh... That was, erm...
Stew? Are you talking about the script?
U-Umi-kun!
S-Script?
Shh!
Oh, was I not supposed to mention that?
What script? Mizuhara?
I'm an actress.
An...
actress?!
Or, well, I'm just starting out.
I work that job because acting school costs money, and it serves as good practice.
Umi-kun is in that school with me. He's a fellow actor.
Blown away
Fellow actor?!
I just had him help me with the script reading assigned to us while shopping.
Script reading?!
Oh, look at the time. I need to head over to the shoot.
Oh, sorry about all this, Umi-kun.
H-H-Hang on a damn second!
What was that phone call in the restroom all about, then?
Phone call?
You were talking about Mizuhara's voice and stuff.
Oh, gosh, you heard all that?
I was just recommending Chizuru-chan to a director I know.
I'm glad it wasn't a big deal.
Yeah, sorry again.
Later.
Sheesh, you're such a moron.
Didn't you stop to consider you might be jumping to conclusions?
How long were you following us, anyway?
Since I spotted you at the station...
The station? That was this afternoon!
That's simply stalking. Don't you have anything better to do in life?
I'm sorry, seriously.
I did decide to leave.
I was convinced you two were dating, and I didn't wanna bother you on your date.
But when I started thinking you might be getting tricked by a scumbag, I...
I just couldn't ignore it.
That's so stupid! Who are you, my boyfriend?!
I'm sorry, Mizuhara.
I'd understand if you never wanted to see my face again.
Honestly, who do I think I am?
Even I can't believe myself.
Worst Christmas ever.
An actress... Mizuhara's amazing.
She really does live in a completely different world.
I truly have... fallen...
Here.
U-Umi-kun only had free time today.
And I figured I needed a guy's opinion if I was picking something out for a guy.
A phone case?
I-I mean, you've been using your broken phone without a case.
It looks awful like that.
Mizuhara?
Th-That said, our secret belongs to both of us.
And I feel bad that I left you to deal with the Ruka-chan issue alone.
I-It's not a gift or anything, okay?
Just a token of my apology.
And so...
H-Hey, what are you crying for?!
I told you, it's not a gift or anything!
Sorry, it's just...
This is the first time a girl's ever given me anything on Christmas.
I've always been a hopelessly moronic loser...
Aw, he's crying.
Did he get dumped?
Aw, jeez.
But, together with Mizuhara,
my life is starting to take on new color.
Oh, it's snowing.
Mizuhara!
You're taking anything but the subway back home.
Wha?!
You're so childish
Puts men to shame
Already a chief at her young age
Sensei!
I need your help with homework!
Mizuhara, an actress?
I know nothing about showbiz.
Don't be modest, Kazuya-kun.
I know you have a ton of movies on DVD.
Wow, that's surprising. What kind of movies do you like?
The ones I saw in his place were, like,
Magic Mirror Something or Stop Time and Something.
Ones with really long titles.
Wait, those aren't movies!
I saw that one coming.
On the next episode of Rent-a-Girlfriend!
Lies...
I-I can explain, Mizuhara!
Stay away from me.
