Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
My love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Hinamori!
Wha-?! I-It cant be!
Captain Aizen!
Captain Aizen No No
Captain Aizen!
Whats all this racket, so early in the morning?
Oh? This is a terrible situation, isnt it?
Be careful
Be careful of Squad 3.
Especially
when Aizen goes out walking alone.
So, it was you!
Kira Why?
Im the lieutenant of Squad 3.
No matter what the reason,
I cannot allow anyone to raise a sword against the captain.
Pleaseget out of my wayKira!
I cannot.
Move! Get out of my way!
No!
Cant you hear me? I said to move!
Cant you hear me say no”?!
Deflect it
Tobiume!
Releasing your Zanpaku-to in a place like this
How thoughtless!
Do you realize what you are doing?!
Do not confuse public matters with private, Lieutenant Hinamori!
I see
Then I have no choice.
I shall dispose of you as an enemy.
Raise your head, Wabisuke!
Dont either of you move.
Hitsugaya
Arrest the two of them!
Hitsugaya!
Hinamori! Is this any time to be clashing swords with each other?
Shouldnt your first priority be to lower Capt. Aizen down from there?
I will make the report to the General Captain.
Put those two under detention. Take them away.
Sorry, Captain of Squad 10
that you had to waste your time on one of mine.
Ichimaru
You were about to kill Hinamori, werent you?
Now What are talking about?
Ill tell you this now
If you allow any of Hinamoris blood to spill
I will kill you!
Thats scary
Id better keep a close eye on her to make sure no bad guy gets to her.
Whats going on?! Captain Ichimaru! Captain Hitsugaya!
Oh! Whats this?!
Captain Aizen is
What in the?
Get Captain Aizen down.
Y-Yes, sir.
What the-?!
Hanataro! What are you doing, sleeping on my knee?!
How disgusting!
My only good pair of pants is slimy with your drool! Bastard!
Damn it!
Hes exhausted.
Dont give him a hard time over a little drool.
I-Ichigo
A-Are you all right, already?
Yeah. Thanks to Hanataro.
Your aches and pains are gone too, right?
Huh? Ohnow that you mention it
It looked like he was up treating your wounds early this morning,
even though he was tired to the bone.
I see I guess he was helping me out before I even knew it.
Hmm? What is it?
Things are gonna get even harder than its been, hereafter.
The enemys probably getting very irritated about now.
Youre serious about doing this, arent you?
Your heart is set on it, I hope.
Sheswaiting.
I didnt come here to tour the sewers, after all.
Please stop it! Please stop!
You shouldnt come on to me like this.
I-Im sorry
Oh! G-Good morning
What the heck were you dreaming about?
I-I cant say
SADO
Chado?
No. Its Sado.
Youre huge! Is that our uniform?
Ive never seen you before.
Im scheduled to transfer to Mashiba Middle School today.
Im in class 2-F.
Were the same age?! I mean, were in the same class?
Good grief
Why didnt you hit back?
Well, in any case, thanks for helping me out.
Hey, should you be standing up?
Y-Yeahno problem.
You sure? You really got pounded. Youre bleeding.
Dont be ridiculous.
If not for the rocks and stuff they used, I wouldve won.
So, these guys are third-year students.
Did you do something to them?
Nope Upperclassmen just dont like my hair.
They dont like anybody who stands out. Thats all it is.
Isnt it the same with you?
I mean, you must really stand out.
Well, shall we get going, Chad?
Its Sado. Youre wobbly, you know
You dont like being called Chad?
Its cool, dont you think? Like Dominic Chad
Never heard of him. Who is he?
Youve never heard of him?!
Then, how about Chad Smith?
Never heard of him.
But I have heard of Eugene Chadbourne.
Whos that?
It was a dream.
Dreaming of the past just like an old man.
Where is he?
Is he there?
No
Okay, this warehouse next.
Group Three, go round the back!
Right!
But, thank goodness
If Id been woken by a knock like this
it wouldve turned into the worst day ever.
Andjust what is that?
In order not to get tired out,
and to continue working like workhorses,
every member of Squad 4 is supplied with this special nutritional tonic.
Really?
Theres a picture of a skull on it.
Are you sure you werent tricked?
Take one tablet, and amazingly
And here I go.
Well, shall we?
Wait, wait, wait, hey! Wait, wait, wait, hey!
What is it?
What do you mean, What is it?”!
Did that pill do anything? It didnt, did it?
What are you talking about?
Doesnt my face look like Im full of energy?
It looks the same as a minute ago.
I think you were tricked, after all.
Kay. Theres no one around.
We just fought here yesterday.
It seems weird that there arent any guards around.
The enemy probably wouldnt think wed still be hanging around here a day later.
I suppose so
Boy, Im full of energy now!
I tell you, you dont look it.
Hey, by the way, you think the others are okay?
Like the guy with the glasses and white cape,
and the chick with walnut-colored hair
The chick”? That words not in” anymore.
I dont think in” is the word anymore, either.
Owwie! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Ishida and Inoue are a hundred times smarter than me.
So that means
youre a hundred times dumber than they are.
Thats what it means.
Owie! Im sorry! Im sorry!
Those two wouldnt take on enemies they know they cant beat.
Theyre fine, Im sure
What about the other oneChad?
Theres even less cause to worry about him.
Whys that?
I can sense it
Huh?
I can sense it, his Spiritual Pressure.
Ever since we landed here.
Besides
I cant imagine Chad ever losing.
Damn Y-Youre a monster
Where is Senzaikyu?
S-Senzaikyu?
When I asked where Rukia Kuchiki was, the last guy just said that and fainted.
I dont know where it is. Tell me.
U-Uh T-Thataway
Its way over there. That white tower-like thing.
Thats Senzaikyu.
Oh Please spare me
I see Thanks.
Uh, no Dont mention it.
Turning your back on your enemy Youre a fool!
I-Im sorry! Im sorry!
D-Dont kill me! Save me! Forgive me!
Please! Ill forget I ever saw you!
Dontcome after me again
Huh? N-No I won't do it again.
Hes not going to kill me? Really?
Now
Were finally here
Lets go! On to Senzaikyu!
Hes here!
Its the Ryoka!
It looks like hes broken through the guardhouse.
Captain Kyoraku
Huh?
What, hes here already?
Oh, well I guess Ill head out, then.
Are you really going?
Its just one Ryoka.
Im your assistant, but I should be more than enough.
Listen, Nanao
Its old man Yamas orders, after all.
He doesnt want anyone thinking were still having problems with the Ryoka.
Grown-ups hate losing face, you know.
Besides
it would be awful if my Nanao went out to fight
and ended up being injured.
Since when am I your Nanao”?!
Oh Youre even more heartless than usual.
Thats whats so wonderful about you!
Yes, maam.
Now, dont look so worried.
Itll be over before you know it.
Ill just have some fun.
Dammit! This sure is a long staircase!
How many steps are there anyway?!
Quit griping, will you?!
Ill see you later!
Huh?!
Didnt I tell you? That medicine really works.
No way! No way!
Okay, were here!
No ones around. Securitys lax here, too.
Okay. Were going straight through to the inner area.
Wha-?!
Huh!
W-Whats with this impossibly powerful Spiritual Pressure?!
WhaWhats doing this?!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll always stay close to you
Now and forever
By the way, have we eaten anything lately?
I'm hungry.
Then let's go to the cafeteria.
Okay, let's go eat some fried rice. Not that way, this way!
Funny I've waited so long, but they still haven't come.
Kenpachi's been stood up.
Oh! Here it is! Here it is!
