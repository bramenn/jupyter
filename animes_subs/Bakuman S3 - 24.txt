Congrats, Mashiro!
Now you and Azuki can get married!
Hurry up and congratulate Miho, okay?
He should be saying Let's get married! instead, right?
Getting married to Azuki...
Is this for real?
It's time to propose for real!
Um...
Hattori will be dropping by for the manuscript.
And it isn't...
Right.
You two can talk later tonight or something.
Yeah.
My sister will get married now.
It's gonna get lonely around here.
I agree.
But it's really amazing that a wish made in middle school can be fulfilled like this.
She's liked him ever since elementary school.
Huh? Elementary school?
Yes.
It was right about in 4th grade, I think?
She stared for quite a while at his drawing in the civic center.
Then her face turned red, and she looked straight at Mashiro.
Wow!
He really was her first love.
She did it! Azukyun won by a mile!
Her acting was great, but I really felt her honesty come through.
Yeah, you said it, Nonaka.
I'll tell that to Mashiro for you.
Now I want a girlfriend more than ever.
By the way, Fukuda, you're pretty cool, and you made it big as a manga artist,
so why don't you have a girlfriend?
That's what I want to know!
Sorry!
We'll take you out for a group date!
Looks like I'll be able to see both Ashirogi members get married.
I don't know about that. Mashiro's not the type to have a public wedding like that.
At least now, Ashirogi will settle down and focus on writing Reversi.
Right.
You keep working hard, too.
All right, this manuscript is good.
And Mashiro's art is as enthusiastic as ever.
The content is also exciting.
Right.
It's exciting, but...
How much do you have left?
Can you make it until October, when the anime starts?
Be honest with me.
If I write it the way I want to, then I have less than 10 chapters left.
I would like it to end in the beginning of July.
I see.
So we've come to that.
I can't keep this from the higher-ups anymore.
We've secured the anime, and Azuki has gotten the role of Naho already,
but the manga will end before the anime even begins.
Are you two really okay with that?
Yes!
It's probably going to be a tough sell, but I'll try my best to make them understand.
Please do!
He's going to try his best, huh?
This won't be easy, will it?
No, it won't.
Well, I bet you want to talk to Azuki, so I'll get going.
Kaya already congratulated her on the phone.
Congratulate her for me.
Y-Yeah.
H-Hello?
Cong
Congratulations!
Th-Thank you.
This is this same as when Reversi got an anime.
You sound like a stranger if you just say Congratulations.
And this time,
it isn't just about getting an anime.
It's our dream.
Th-That's right!
I'm sorry!
Um, so, I thought that I should say this properly.
Okay.
I have something I need to confirm with you.
Huh?
Th-The moment when our dream comes true, technically speaking,
is when the anime is broadcast on TV,
and people hear your voice come out of Naho's mouth, right?
Yes, I think that's exactly when.
We can't completely relax until then.
You never know what might happen.
Maybe the world might cease to exist before October.
When that time comes...
When Naho speaks on TV,
I'll come pick you up!
Okay.
So, did you propose to her properly?
No.
What?!
Your dream came true, so you have to do it!
It hasn't really been fulfilled until our anime airs.
Who knows? Maybe the world will end tomorrow.
Huh?
So, I told her that I'd come pick her up once Naho's voice is broadcast over TV.
And that's when you'll propose.
Good!
Well done.
But that's right in the middle of the episode.
Um, about yesterday's promise...
How'd it go?
We revised it to be right after the first episode is finished airing.
Um, I have a favor to ask of you.
What? Name it.
Will you lend me money?
Money?
Yeah.
I want to pick up Azuki in the best possible way.
You're going to buy a house?
Yeah.
Sure. I'll lend you however much you want.
Thanks!
I have to think of something to give them as a wedding present.
Are you serious?
Yes.
The anime is starting in October, yet they're ending it in 10 chapters?
They want to do what's best for Reversi and end it in the best possible way.
Definitely not!
Have them continue it for the duration of the anime.
But, the authors themselves are
One of the skills of an editor
is being able to take care of a successful manga and making it last as long as possible
for the readers' enjoyment.
Besides, who knows what the anime staff will say when they hear that the manga
is ending before they even start.
You and Ashirogi need to figure out how to extend the manga.
He reacted just as I predicted.
He told us to not let it end until at least one season into the anime.
The conclusion is already set in stone,
so we have go through with it.
How about we conclude it, take a two to three week break,
then start a second story?
How's that sound?
A second story?
I know I said I didn't care when it ends,
so I'm sorry to ask this of you,
but you've finally gotten an anime.
As an editor, I really do want you to continue with it and surpass Zombie Gun.
I do want to surpass Niizuma, but...
Saikou, what do you think?
We should forge ahead and wrap up this storyline.
I haven't changed my opinion on that.
And after that,
if you as the writer can come up with an even better story, I'll draw it.
Although I think coming up with an even better story will be pretty difficult.
Hattori, can you give us some more time?
Of course.
I apologize.
Anyway, if there's any possible way you can continue it,
the editing department would prefer you take that route.
And if we decide to end it anyway, it won't go down well, right?
In that case, I'll take responsibility and try to convince them somehow.
If we do end this by the beginning of July,
then the final volume of the manga will be released in August.
Uh, yeah.
For manga that have concluded, we like to release the final volume
as soon as the author is ready so as not to lose sales.
Let's talk about this again next week.
Think about it.
It's complicated, isn't it?
Well, they are making our anime.
This is what happens.
I do want to beat Eiji,
but there's no point in just briefly getting ahead of him when the anime starts.
I'm going home now.
Okay.
I can decide if we should continue based on whether I can come up with a new story, right?
Just make sure that the new story's better than the first one if you decide to do it.
I know. See you.
Good night.
Hattori, where are you now?
I'm at the train station.
Good.
I have something to discuss with you.
What is it?
8 chapters.
There are only 8 chapters left!
There's no point in extending the manga and hoping for a boost from the anime!
If we're going to surpass Niizuma Eiji, it has to be now!
We have to put everything we have into the final scenes.
Doing 8 more chapters will set the perfect pace to get the best possible ending.
And before the anime starts, with our final manga volume,
we'll surpass Zombie Gun's number of printed copies!
I want Mashiro...
to be the number one manga author in Jack when he gets married!
That's how it should be.
That's Ashirogi Mutou.
Leave the rest to me, your editor!
Make your ending the best ever!
Right!
I thought I told you to come up with some way of extending it.
And instead you tell them it's okay to end it?
Yes.
Ashirogi Mutou always aims higher.
They're constantly searching for ways to raise the level of their craft
and become the manga authors they should be!
And that led them to believe that they should end it in eight weeks?
Yes!
Because they truly value Reversi,
they want to end it in a way that's best for the manga.
That's what they're saying.
Takagi can come up with another good series quickly.
Mashiro will draw it, and they'll churn out one good manga after another.
That's their style! That's what I believe.
If you won't give permission for them to end it,
I'll quit editing!
Hey, you're kidding, right?!
No, I'm not!
I said I would take responsibility for letting them end it!
Even so...
When the author and the company are at odds, a real editor stands by their author.
I think what Ashirogi is saying makes sense.
Letting other media constrain and threaten the quality of the manga
is putting the cart before the horse!
That old man...
He said the same thing to me a long time ago.
When the author and the company are at odds, stand by the author, huh?
Good grief.
I'll deal with the rest of this.
Chief Editor...
The manga will end in July?!
Ending it at this time...
It's a significant decision.
An unfortunate one, given that they knew there was an anime being made.
Th-That's right! We wanted this to be as long as possible.
No, this could actually work for us.
There are certain merits in knowing the entire breadth of the work while making it.
I'd be pleased if you think of it that way.
I promise you that its spectacular ending will make the work a masterpiece.
All right.
We'll make an anime that does the manga justice.
Saikou!
I just got a phone call from Hattori. They'll let us end the manga in 8 chapters!
8 more chapters, huh?
That's the best thing for Reversi.
Of course.
We can end the manga exactly the way we hoped, the way I planned.
I've already decided on the last scene!
All we have to do is head toward that!
The last scene, huh?
That's what separates masterpieces from mediocrity.
Yeah.
That's why I want you to take your time and start on it now.
So, what kind of ending is it?
Satoru promises Naho that he will return to being a human,
and heads off to the final battle.
But, in order to return to being fully human,
he has to kill Schwarz, who has possessed him.
If he does that, he will die.
If your demon dies, you die as well.
And if you die, your demon dies.
In the last moment, Satoru dies as a human.
Your last chapter will be in Issue 31, with colored insert pages.
Thank you!
You should really have the front cover.
But the Chief and everyone else were surprised.
They thought it was a waste to end it.
We're sorry.
No, don't apologize.
The readers will be surprised too.
A manga that habitually traded the 1st and 2nd spots with Zombie Gun is now ending.
So they won't be satisfied with a half-baked ending!
Right!
What?! Reversi is ending?!
Yes.
This really was the final showdown, huh?
So you're finishing this confrontation and ending it.
That's nice and clear-cut.
Which means, our jobs...
We'll just have PCP, but we won't be changing our organization,
so you can just take it easy for a while.
But it's such a shame.
You've been at the top spot in the rankings ever since this battle started.
I agree with this.
Instead of letting it drag on, ending it like this is more artistic.
White vs. Black is really exciting.
I don't know what to tell my little brother when he asks me what will happen next.
Oh, crap!
Reversi's been really good lately!
Schwarz is gonna win in the end, right?
But Black on the defensive.
He didn't attack on purpose because he's saving up his power, right?
But once this battle ends, what are they going to do?
What? Won't it just end?
No way. This is Jack, and the anime's about to start.
Then maybe this won't really be the final battle.
That would be a shock, too.
They've built up the climax so much.
Hey, what do you think will happen after this?
I'm sure a gold demon will come out!
They'll fight with angels next.
Oh, that sounds cool!
What if they become friends?
What do you think of the last chapter?
No complaints! All that's left now is to see how good I can make the art.
You gave me the last two-page spread to draw ahead of time,
so this'll go well!
Yeah! I think so too!
With all the excitement we've been building up since we began the final battle,
the last chapter will be the true number one!
The true number one?
We've been getting first place in the survey,
but among currently serializing manga, we're second in sales per volume.
In this last volume with the conclusion of the final battle,
we'll bump our volume sales up to number one!
Number one is...
Yes.
Zombie Gun's 1.2 million copies sold.
Yes, this is the best ending.
Thank you.
All in all, 49 chapters. It really lasted just about a year.
Yes.
There seems to be more fan letters than usual.
These are the usual fan letters.
And these are from Azuki Miho fans, I suppose.
Letters of protest against Azuki and Mashiro.
And these are fan letters supporting Azuki and Mashiro.
I believe the reason Azuki had such a huge win in the open audition for the Naho role
is because she had the support of Ashirogi Mutou fans.
At present, Reversi sales are at 1.02 million copies per volume.
That's how many readers are supporting you.
I know it's been hard having this and PCP,
but your fans are waiting for you.
Right!
Wow!
We could never pull off the kind of art he's got here in his last scene.
They've pushed the limits of what's possible in both story and art.
You've done it, Ashirogi Mutou!
For real?
Reversi just ended!
What? Really?!
No way!
See?
I see. It was a simultaneous K.O., then.
Read it again. He voluntarily discarded the demon's power and died, right?
Did he pay for his sins with his own life?
Rather than paying for his sins, it was his promise with Naho, right?
He was pretty awesome.
I didn't think it would actually end.
I'm gonna collect all the volumes of Reversi! It'll only be six volumes, after all.
Me too!
Do I have any allowance left?
It seems that Hattori and Ashirogi's decision wasn't wrong.
You could say that it ended as a masterpiece that'll go down in the history of Jack.
You can remove the could from that sentence!
Nine weeks in a row in first place!
And with its last chapter way ahead of everyone else!
Right, Hattori?
Yeah!
Hello?
You did it!
Volumes 5 and 6 sold out in a day!
And...
We did it...
We did it.
A 200,000 copy reprint!
Reversi's at 1.22 million copies per volume!
We've finally surpassed Zombie Gun's 1.2 million!
Wow!
We've passed Niizuma Eiji in both the rankings and volume sales!
We did it!
Now Saikou can marry Azuki as the number one artist in Jack!
Shuujin...
That's what you were after all along?
Uh, yeah.
I was thinking about what was the best thing to give you for your and Azuki's wedding.
I wanted it to be a really awesome present, and this is what I came up with...
Well, you did half of it.
I'm glad we made it in time.
Thanks.
I forgot I was on the phone with Hattori!
Hello?
I'm sorry, I just...
I don't mind.
Also, upon the ending of Reversi, the Chief Editor would like to come and see you.
Huh? Oh no, don't trouble yourselves. We'll go see him ourselves.
It's been a while since we've been to the editing department.
Yeah. We haven't come out here in ages...
Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we go?
Roger!
It's fun to go observe an anime studio.
Letsura gon!
We're not going just to observe.
We're going to have a meeting about your anime adaptation for next year.
Oh, Ashirogi. It's rare to see you here.
Hello.
You here for a meeting?
Y-Yeah.
I think Hattori will be back soon.
Why don't you go have some coffee?
Okay.
Thank you.
Ashirogi.
I'll make Zombie Gun sell 3 million copies and wait for you to catch up!
Next time, we'll make a series that'll sell 3.5 million copies!
Roger!
My dream.
My dream.
Each dream overlaps with each other,
making one strong dream.

Dreams are meant to come true.
