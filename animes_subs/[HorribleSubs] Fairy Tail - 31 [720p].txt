Hey, all you viewers out there!
When you're watchin' Fairy Tail, make sure to keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen,'kay?
This here is a secret base for a certain gang of thieves in the west outskirts of Magnolia.
Good job!
One-hit knockout!
You're so amazing, Lucy!
It'll be all right! I'll yell it out countless times.
I believe your every tomorrow will be shining.
The intersection of all people
Never giving up. And that's why we're not gonna lose!
When it seems like you'll be blown away by the headwinds,
grasp this hand, try to take a chance.
Because you're not alone anymore, got it?
Go forward, more and more!
Don't give up on your awesome dream!
That's right, don't cry!
Move on, my way!
Now, with the light shining down upon you.
Don't even think about something like giving up!
Even if you trade being hurt again for strength.
Your eyes, always looking straight ahead,
can surely see the light!
These guys are such pushovers.
Don't go robbin' people when you're such weaklings!
You think you'll get away with doing this to us?
Master Devon won't stand for it!
We beat that guy a while ago.
I've finished up over here as well.
That's our Erza!
You won't escape!
Looks like you haven't had enough punishment yet...
Erza! Please punish me as well!
Forced Gate Closure, yeah!
That took less time than I thought.
I didn't get to go nuts enough!
You were plenty nuts back there, buddy.
Lucy, check out this jewel!
Hey! You can't just go taking that!
Isn't that Loke over there?
Oh?
What a coincidence.
You had a job around here?
Yeah. You, too?
Lucy?!
This is perfect. I wanted to thank you for...
Sorry, I'm in the middle of a job!
What is with him?
What did you do to him?
He is so totally avoiding you.
I didn't do anything!
The Star that Cannot Return to the Heavens!
Now then, shall we go back?
Hey, since we actually finished a job early for once, why don't we head to a spa and take it easy?
Lucy...
Yes?
That's a good idea.
And...
This is Magnolia's most popular spa town, Hosenka.
Set up by a Duke influenced by the Orient, it is a garish and somewhat iffy tourist spot.
And besides, what's with Loke, anyway?
Nice moon.
And a nice bath, as well.
In your armor and all?
I feel more at ease like this.
But, doesn't it feel kind of gross?
Honestly, yes it does.
Coming to a spa such as this really does merit complete relaxation, I agree.
Yet your words are as stiff as ever...
You're even amazing when you're naked, Erza!
Am I? Then how about I try going around the guild naked?
I'm joking.
It begins!
Upa!
What's all the racket? I'm sleepy!
Hey, look around you! We're at an inn!
Nighttime in hotels means pillow fists!
You mean pillow fights...
All the pillows of merit in the room are already under my control!
Of merit?
I will defeat Erza!
What am I going to do with you people?
Natsu! Why you little...
Wow, where'd all these pillows come from?
Juvia is so happy being of help to Gray-sama!
Erza, you're next!
Not bad.
All right! Maybe I'll mix it up myself...
Then again, maybe not.
I might die.
Are they even really human?
Well, Happy's a cat, and you're a dog, Plue!
I'm actually a human-pun.
Oh?
Human... Wait, you can talk?
Aye!
Aye!
I am an emissary of the Hero with the Sacred Stone-pun!
Yes, yes... Stop this foolishness and come out, you.
I thought you'd be stupid enough for me to fool you for a week.
That's quite a generous guesstimate there...
So, where are you going, Lucy?
Having a pillow fight with those guys is bad for my health.
Just a little walk.
Hey girl, man!
That yukata looks great on you. Tourist?
We came here from Oshibana, man!
Let's have a funky time, man!
Humor potential overload!
Sorry, but I'm with someone.
Oh? Not even a little while, man?
Sorry.
You're with that cat and...
Well, it's okay to take those funky little fellas with us, man.
Let's go!
They're pushy...
Happy, do something!
Nya!
Did you just say nya?!
Aw, you talk to cats! How cute!
No!
Let's go!
Get funky, man!
Hey, you guys. That's about...
What's this? I can't move my body!
Let's have a good time together.
We'll have one funky night, man!
They're wizards?
Oh, no!
What the...man!
Man!
Man...
Are you hurt?
Loke!
I'm sorry...
For what?
Those two have been targeting lone female travelers.
They're criminal wizards.
I was in the middle of capturing them.
I have to deliver these guys, so if you'll excuse me.
Wait!
Thank you for saving me.
And also for finding my keys.
No, don't mention it.
So, why don't we go out for a bit?
What a development!
That's not what I meant.
Eating establishment, Super Express.
It's one of the top-two most popular spots in the town of Hosenka.
It's said you'll become hooked on the various delicacies cooked up by its silent, nodding chef.
So...
You don't have to stay so far away.
S-Sorry...
I've wanted to ask you this for a while, but what did this Celestial Wizard to do you?
If you don't want to tell, I don't mind...
Aventure
But I'm not that person, you know.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry, really.
I apologize if I've hurt you.
You should just forget about me.
What's with that cliched breakup line?
That's not what I meant...
Breakup, huh?
What about breaking up?
I remembered something from long ago.
What?
Fine, never mind.
I just wanted to ask, is all.
Thanks for saving me.
I understand a bit why you're so popular.
And for me I thought, we really are friends, after all.
Then, I'd better get...
Wait.
What?
Lucy.
Yes?
I don't...
Um...
What do you mean?
Got you.
This is a trick to pick up girls!
You make them all sad for you.
So? I bet you're pretty surprised.
Let's go, Happy, Plue!
What am I doing?
I can't be swept away by feelings.
I can't get Lucy involved!
It's already...
What's with them?
They say they got hurt in a pillow fight after their job was over.
How can people get that injured in a pillow fight?
Is Gray-sama okay?
And what were you gettin' so worked up about for a pillow fight?
I give everything 100!
And yet you lost!
What? It was you that lost!
Gray-sama won inside Juvia's heart!
Lucy! I'm the one who won, right?
Shut up.
W-We're sorry.
Wow. There's actually someone other than Erza who can stop those two...
A Man.
Lucy, you've been in a bad mood.
Oh? I'm totally normal.
Are you still angry about me tricking you?
No! I'm not that petty.
Sorry... I just have a lot to think about.
You can always talk to me!
No, but thanks anyway.
Lucy...
It's almost time.
Hey, is Loke here?
Where's Loke?
Loke's so cruel!
Who are you people?
That's what I should ask you!
Where is Loke?
What's with them?
They're women from the town.
It seems they all think they're Loke's girlfriend.
He tried to break up all of a sudden last night!
I hate to say it, but me too!
And me!
Plus me!
Why'd he say such a thing?
I-I don't know...
Did he finally find the one?
No...
Who is it? Is it someone in the guild?
Lucy, save me!
Who is this woman?
Sure she's a little cute...
And she's got big boobs...
So Loke's true love is...
Don't put me in such a sticky situation, Mira!
Then!
This is the sole public bath in Magnolia.
It's renowned for regenerating magical power as it relieves fatigue.
Public baths... are Manly!
Using the public bath once in a while sure is nice!
Nothing beats soaking in a huge bath!
Loke!
Here.
It's perfect after you get out of the bath.
It's flavored milk!
I wanted to drink it together with you.
You know I had it pretty rough this afternoon thanks to you.
Now, now... Cheers! To your beautiful eyes.
Delicious!
Isn't it?
The stars sure are pretty.
Yeah.
A shooting star!
I wonder what happens to shooting stars after they fall?
Hey, Lucy...
Do you understand the sorrow of a star that cannot return to the heavens?
That's another line to pick up girls, isn't it?
You think you can trick me again?
You got me.
Sheesh... Everything out of your mouth is to get girls...
I'm glad I was able to talk with you casually like this.
Bye.
Gate of the Southern Cross, I open thee!
Crux!
So Crux is this old man!
Yes! His nickname is Crumudgeon!
It's kind of sudden, but I have a request.
Can you use your power to look into the Celestial Wizard that Loke was with in the past, Crumudgeon?
He's asleep, Lucy!
Don't worry, he's looking things up.
You're lying! He's totally asleep!
Crumudgeon is a specialist in Celestial Studies.
He knows everything about the gates that connect the Spirit World with the human one.
He knows all about what Celestial Wizards could call out which spirits in the past.
Did you find something?
I cannot be too detailed as personal information is protected even in the spirit world, however,
the Celestial Wizard connected to Loke is Karen Lilica.
Karen Lilica?
You know her, Lucy?
She's a super-famous Celestial Wizard.
Extremely beautiful, and she used to do photo shoots for Sorcerer.
But some years ago she died while on a job.
So she was a guild wizard.
Yeah. Blue Pegasus, if I recall.
So... What was the relationship between Loke and Karen?
I am sorry, but that is all I can say.
Hey!
He's researching again!
No, he's asleep.
Karen and Loke...
I don't have long to live.
Wait...
Do you understand the sorrow of a star that cannot return to the heavens?
He can't mean... Loke?
What's the matter, Lucy?
Lucy, we have a problem!
Loke's gone and left Fairy Tail!
W-Why?
We don't know! Everyone's searching for him.
He's been acting totally weird lately.
It couldn't be...
Hey, Lucy!
Where are you going to look for him?
Loke!
Where are you?
Loke!
Loke!
You in there, Loke?
I doubt it.
Loke!
Loke!
Loke!
Lucy.
Everyone's searching for you.
That's Karen's grave, isn't it?
The Celestial Wizard Karen... Your owner.
Spirit Loke...
No... Your real name is...
Leo, the Lion!
You did well to realize I was actually a spirit.
Well, I am a Celestial Wizard with contracts with many spirits.
I finally figured out the truth behind you.
But I should have noticed it sooner, shouldn't I?
After an incident where the owner dies, their contract with the spirit is nullified.
Then the spirit is forced back to the spirit world until a new owner appears.
Karen died, so the contract should be over, and yet you're here in the human world.
For some reason, you can't return to the spirit world, can you?
Just as humans can't live in the spirit world, spirits can't live forever in the human world.
Your spirit life-energy will be slowly drained from you,
and finally you will meet your end.
It's already been 3 years.
T-Three years? I couldn't fathom even one!
I'm at my limit...
I don't have any strength left at all.
I might be able to save you somehow!
Tell me why you can't return! I'll open the gate for you!
I don't need to be saved.
What are you saying?
At this rate you're really going to die!
The reason I can't go back is simple.
I broke a fundamental rule between owner and spirit.
And because of it, I have been banished from the spirit world for all eternity.
Banished... for eternity?
It is my crime.
I shall accept even death.
As a spirit, I am a traitor.
My owner was Karen...
And with my own hands...
I wonder what the spirit world is like?
Natsu, you went through the spirit world once while grabbing onto Virgo, right?
Didn't you see back then?
It was all so sudden. I was gone before I even realized it.
Oh! I might have gotten a glimpse of something, though...
Ooh, what?
Mustache?
Next time: The Spirit King!
Mustache? What's that supposed to mean?
You'll just have to tune in next time to find out!
Now that's a classic preview line!
