Where are we going, Coach?
You'll know when we get there.
Youth Volleyball Class
Let's go home and practice!
That was so much fun!
Sorry.
Hey, you made him cry.
What am I even doing here?
Shh, stop that.
The class is already over.
Toru! Show me how to serve!
Hey! How about showing some respect first?
O-Oikawa-san!
Come on! Move those legs!
Nice receive!
One more!
Whoa, I can't get that!
Are you sure you're supposed
I'm tired!
to be moving around like that right after getting out of the hospital?
What? If they let you out of the hospital,
it means they're giving you permission to move around all you want.
He's my grandpa.
Huh?!
Gra...
Coach Ukai?!
Haikyu!!
Ukai
So...
You couldn't figure out what to do
Episode 06: Tempo
with this weirdo quick attack and helplessly ran away, eh, Coach?
That's your team, you weakling!
Coach?!
He's the great commander that led the nameless Karasuno to nationals.
The name Karasuno's Ukai was super famous.
They said he owned a fierce pack of crows.
P-Please help me!
With what?
I don't go around smacking random people.
Just weaklings.
You shitty old man...
I-I came here to learn to fight on my own!
You want to master mid-air battles? When you're only that tall?
It's because I'm only this tall!
I might sound like I'm saying something weird, but...
What's weird about it?
No matter what kind of genius setter you're dealing with,
in what we call a quick attack,
the one that's the absolute leader
is you.
Stop spacing out! You're the coach, damn it!
O-Oikawa-san, what are you doing here?
I'm watching my nephew.
Hey!
H-Hey... What about club?
We usually have Mondays off.
Y-You take a day off during the week? That's such a waste!
Resting and skipping are two different things.
See ya.
O-Oikawa-san, um...
Nope! Stupid!
You're stupid! You stupid face!
I haven't even said anything yet!
Oikawa-san
Nope! Can't hear you! Can't hear a thing!
Please listen to me for a second.
Why should I have to listen to what my opponent has to say?
Please, Oikawa-san!
Please! Please!
Please!
Takeru.
What?
Take a picture.
Hold it like this... And press this button.
Don't move, Tobio.
Yay! I'll call this, Tobio is No Match For Oikawa-san!
Toru, you're actually happy about this picture? Lame.
Well, what do you want?
I'm busy, you know.
You said your girlfriend dumped you, so you had free time!
Takeru! Shut up!
What? But when you came, you said you didn't know what you did wrong...
I said, Shut up!
So, uh, what if you were close to a tournament, and, uh...
And Iwaizumi-san said he was going to try some impossible attack...
Hey.
If you want to talk to me about something,
quit with the lame what if story and just tell me flat out.
Hinata said he wants to hit our quick with his own will,
even though he had been closing his eyes this whole time.
Oh, really? That'd be pretty impressive if he could do it.
Why not let him?
Please don't make it sound so easy!
Hinata doesn't have any technique!
So you told him, Just do as I say?
You sound like a dictator.
Have you put any thought into it?
Are you giving the shrimp the exact tosses he wants?
Have you even tried to?
Kageyama...
Give me a toss.
If you're thinking the situation as good as it can be and you're being defensive about it,
you're basically a coward.
Don't get the wrong idea.
The one who has leadership in an attack isn't you...
It's the little shrimp.
If you can't understand that,
you're just regressing back to playing the tyrant king.
Let's go, Takeru.
Are you in a good mood, Toru?
I'm happy that Tobio's more run down that I thought he was.
I'm totally blurry!
You'll need awareness before you improve your technique.
What do you personally think about this weirdo quick of yours?
Um... I go whoosh, and then jump up as high as I can, like pop,
and then the set comes toward me, like slash,
and then if I wave my arm, like swoosh,
my hand happens to perfectly make contact, like whack.
Er, what he's trying to say is when he jumps up with his eyes closed,
our setter, Kageyama, tosses the ball directly to him
I get what you're trying to say.
But you're wrong, Shrimpy.
So long as that weirdo quick is indeed a quick attack,
you still hold the initiative in this.
You need to get that through your head.
Don't think of your weapon as something that's unknown.
Well, I guess it's faster to just show you.
Shrimpy, try blocking.
You're a middle blocker, aren't ya? Try stopping it.
You're in junior high?
What school?
I'm in high school!
All right, here we go!
Okay!
Is this height for grade school kids?
I feel a bit taller.
Third tempo.
Third tempo?
That's an amazing jump!
Your face was totally above the net.
Well, yeah.
You've definitely got some spring in your step...
All right, next!
Second tempo.
They're coming faster than before, but...
All right, next!
First tempo!
Well?
It's fast!
Can you block that?
If anything, I don't think I could do it on my own.
In the three tempos you just saw,
was there a big difference in how the spiker hit?
No! I don't think...
Then what was different?
The timing of their running approach?
Correct! That's what the tempo is.
Listen. The agility in any attack is determined by its tempo.
It's not how fast or slow the toss may be,
it's the timing of the spiker's running approach.
The fastest is the first tempo.
It's the best way to get around the opponent's block,
and is probably the attack you were doing without realizing it.
But you need to actually understand it.
You need to start your running approach before the setter's toss goes up...
The setter tosses to the spiker...
Which means, your weirdo quick is also an attack where the spiker leads.
First... tempo...
And... I don't know what kind of attack this weirdo quick is,
but this much is certain.
There's no better toss than one that the spiker can easily hit.
It can't be one-sided.
Eh?
Hinata, practice here for a bit!
S-Sure...
What a weirdo.
The timing of the spiker's running approach is everything.
One centimeter,
one millimeter...
One second faster to the top...
But that's not enough.
Up until now, I was only working to get to the top, but...
So from now on,
you want to fight at the top, too.
In order for that to happen,
your partner's gonna need some improvement, as well.
Huh?
I'm sure Keishin will do something about that.
Kageyama's an amazing guy, so I'm sure he can do it.
I don't want to be left behind...
Please teach me how to fight when I'm at the top.
Don't get the wrong idea.
The one who has leadership in an attack isn't you...
It's the little shrimp.
If you can't understand that,
you're just regressing back to playing the tyrant king.
Yes, hello
Kageyama! Where are you right now?!
Ukai-san?
I'm heading to the school right now.
What?!
I was gonna see if they were done with the inspection of the gym yet.
Ah!
Kageyama!
Whoa.
Stop walking! Come with me!
I'm sorry?!
A toss that stops!
Haikyu!!
Haikyu!!
Shrimpy,
if you're gonna fight at the top on your own,
you're gonna have to start with the fundamentals.
Therefore, you're gonna be hitting one quick after another.
You're going to get in all the practice that you missed before.
Hello!
Heyo!
There you are.
Hi!
Shrimpy, your assignment right now
is to do first tempo with anyone.
Got it!
A newbie?
Your genius setter isn't here to toss to you,
He's in junior... Oh, he's in high school.
so it's not gonna be easy.
Ah...
Right!
Also,
in order to get used to the ball,
you need to always be touching it.
Always.
Okay.
It can be with your hands or feet.
Volleyball is a sport where you can't hold the ball.
You're only allowed to touch the ball for a few seconds...
You need to control that moment,
as though ball were a part of your body.
Because your body is small,
use everything else possible to make up for that.
Right!

Tempo?
Well, I have the basic theory of it in my head,
but I was never able to apply it.
I treated your quick attack as something special when I shouldn't have,
and almost forgot something very basic.
I think I get the basics of tempo,
but what do you mean by a toss that stops?
Listen. First...
When you're tossing for your weirdo quick,
Point of Impact
it's a toss that passes through the spiker's point of impact.
Right...
But you're going to stop it right there,
at the point of impact.
So, basically...
You're going to make the spiker's highest point of impact
the place you're going to aim for.
You're not going to use so much force
that that the ball passes through the spiker's point of impact,
You'll use just enough force to get to the spiker's point of impact, and then...
The difficulty in controlling your power and how much backspin you put on it
isn't going to be like before.
Not to mention B-quick, D-quick, and slide hits...
The farther out you get, the more difficult they'll become.
Can you do it?
Are you giving the shrimp the exact tosses he wants?
Have you even tried to?
Don't Cause a Ruckus
I'll give it a try.
Tanaka-san!
Oh?
I-I'm sorry about the other day!
No problem! Kageyama just came by, too.
I'm sorry for hitting you guys.
Stop!
I got too worked up trying to stop you guys from fighting.
Your punch really worked, Tanaka-san.
But don't fight in front of girls!
Yacchan's face was as pale as a ghost.
T-T-Tanaka-shan!
They're gonna die! They're gonna die!
What is? You're scary!
Also, don't fight in front of the Vice Principal, either.
Fight anywhere else.
Right!
Hinata, come here a sec.
All right...
When we're doing practice games, Hinata, you'll be on the B team for a while.
Sugawara, I'm counting on you.
Right!
All right, let's get this started!
Make sure you stay hydrated!
Right!
Um, Hinata...
U-Um, I was wondering if you were okay...
You and Kageyama-kun, um, uh...
I'm fine.
Year 3 Class 1
Yui! Sawamura-kun's here.
What?
Hey...
Once the girls finish practice,
I was wondering if we could borrow the court
until the gym closes, even just for a little bit.
Oh, sure. I'll go ask.
Did something happen to the second gymnasium?
No, it's just...
A lot of the guys are doing their own practices.
so we don't have enough room.
Damn it.
Serving is the ultimate attack...
The only one at Karasuno
who can safely use a jump serve is Kageyama.
I'm not good enough to be able to use it safely in matches.
But then...
I couldn't call it a weapon!
Asahi-san!
A Match for a Thousand
Mind if I join you?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
He casually scooped it up upon entering... Damn it.
Would you mind hitting some of my tosses?
Yeah, sure.
Uh, wait, what?
You're going to toss?
Could it be...
He's gonna try what Seijoh's libero was doing?
I'll help you with your serves, too, Asahi-san.
I can't be left behind...
Sure. Let's do this.
All right!
First Gymnasium
We'll leave the rest up to you guys.
Thanks!

Oh, here it is.
Is this a video of Brazil's attacks?
They all started moving at once.
Shinzen's attack was like this, too.
Um...
A synchronized attack.
Next, please.
Got it!
Good evening!
Sho-chan.
There you are, Shrimpy.
Um, Coach Ukai,
I've been meaning to tell you...
But I'm not Shrimpy.
It's a good enough name for a crappy player like you.
Come on! Let's go, Shrimpy!
I'm ready!
You need to put all your thought into jumping with all your might.
There you go.
You need to be able to hit the ball at any time, at will,
regardless of who the setter is.
Right!
Don't try to match them!
You need to jump at your own pace,
not anyone else's.
You need to fight with your own will!
Let's go!
Hey, Tsukki.
I'm gonna head this way.
I'm gonna go practice serves at Shimada-san's place.
Yeah.
See ya.

Woof
Oh, sorry! It might be a bit short!
That's amazing, Sho-kun! Nice cover.
You used to panic so quickly, even if it was just a little off.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Shut up!
Up until now, I was able to hit without thinking too much
because of my amazing setter...
But now, all of your techniques and habits are different,
so I have to make it work in mid-air.
It's just a little, but I can see the ball better than before.
Give me a hand, Shrimpo.
It went from Shrimpy to Shrimpo.
He's been promoted!
Is that really a promotion?
You're going to Tokyo the day after tomorrow, aren't ya?
Nekoma's coming, too, right?
Yes.
Sensei told us that Coach Nekomata's the one who invited us over.
He's hard to get along with, but his volleyball sense is second to none.
The players he's leading aren't going to be easy to handle.
Let the push you to your limits.
Right!
First Gymnasium
All right!
Next, please!
You got it!
Now, that it's summer vacation, we can practice from morning to night.
And starting tomorrow, we'll resume the Tokyo away games.
This time, we'll be there for a solid week!
This is the first and last long-term training camp
before the spring tournament prelims.
Let's make the most of this opportunity,
so we have no regrets entering the spring tournament prelims.
Noya-san, you started practicing tossing?
Yep! I'm gonna do a running approach to here...
Then Jumping Thunder Toss!
Uh, wait. Where'd the ball go?
How about you start by practicing normal tosses?
