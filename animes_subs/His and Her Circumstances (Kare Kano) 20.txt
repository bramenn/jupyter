My family was rich.
I was sickly since birth...
I was given as much candy and toys as I wanted...
You fatso Takefumi!
We're not gonna play with YOU!
I even had metabolic diseases in third grade.
Tonami-kun! Tonami-kun!
Everyone's talking about how tall and cool you are.
I wonder if it's true that people from Okinawa all all good looking.
My height? Well, I play basketball, so...
Playing basketball in Okinawa that sounds so cool!
Besides, I'm not from Okinawa.
Oh yeah, you used to live around here, right?
Until seventh grade.
I have a picture. Want to see?
Yeah, yeah!
Which one?
This one.
Yeah Right!
Nice Shot!
And this is what she made us follow her around for?
But Tsubaki really gets into anything that has to do with sports.
Just look at her expression.
Doesn't she seem like a totally different person from this morning?
Well, I guess it'sbetter than smacking people
who annoy her without a care of what people think of her.
You listen
Okay, keep your eyes glued to this one!
Tsubaki said she's going to sink a dunk shot today no matter what.
Why would someone on the volleyball team want to sink a dunk shot?
Well, it's Tsubaki... Ooh, so close!
I want to go back to the classroom already.
Argh, next time for sure.
Just give it up.
Don't blame me if you get hurt.
At some point I got used to being made fun of.
So? C'mon, tell us.
Once you accept the fact that you're worthless anyway...
Moron, moron!
Give back my sneakers!
Stupid, they're too good for you!
Quit bullying around!!
Thank you.
You saved me
Don't you let them make you cry either!! (Text:They both annoy her)
She knew judo, karate, aikido, and boxing...
She terrified every guy in school.
That was Sakura Tsubaki. (Text:But she was nice to girls)
After that, she fixated on me for some reason.
What?
Just come with me.
This, and this, and this...
And this, and this, and this...
This'll be all, ma'am.
That'll be 280 yen.
280 yen.
What?!
What, I can't use a credit card?
Ok, here. (Text:10,000 Yen)
This was just for today, okay? Don't do it any more.
Oh, fine.
Here, have half.
I don't want anything with all those...
I only eat the candy mommy buys me from Ginza.
And another time...
Pedal.
You can't even ride a bike?! What a loser!!
Sh...Shut up,
I just always get a ride in daddy's car.
You'll be fine. I'll support you back here. (Text:Riding double is dangerous!)
Really?
Yeah, sure.
There was no end to Sakura's abuse of me.
Do it.
She made me do her homework,
and then hit me.
What the hell? This is wrong!
I don't make stupid mistakes like this!
I always do what you tell me to,
so I want you to help me when I need it.
Of course, I wouldn't make you do it for free. Here.
Sure.
Stupid meatball!
I have Sakura on my side!
Okay Sakura, beat them up!
Oh, sorry.
It's time for a TV show I wanted to watch.
Ask me when nothing's on TV.
Why do you keep hanging around me anyway?
Don't tell me you like me.
Oh please.
Barbarian girls like you aren't my type.
I have this urge to hit you.
You should stop and think why you get beat up for once.
It was like I was stuck with the plague...all the way until seventh grade.
Damn you Sakura... (Text:But I can't do anything)
Therefore...
I was overjoyed when I heard we were moving. *Yahoo!*
I'll finally be free from this humiliating life!
Farewell, to the old me who was forced to be who I wasn't!
But... I wanted to find out one last thing.
Sakura, why do you keep pestering me?
Oh, the teacher asked me to look after you back in elementary school.
With me around, you wouldn't get beat up that much.
And it's rather my policy not to beat people up.
Well, good luck at your new school.
Take care.
She was asked, that was all. She thoght nothing of me.
For the first time in my life, I realized my pride was deeply hurt.
That to her, I was a meaningless existence.
But it was obvious, if you think about it. I was such a failure.
I knew I'd only be away for a short while.
I will change.
I will change so much that there'll be no way she can ignore me the next time we meet.
I'm not going to let it end like this.
Tsubaki, let's go back to class!
Not yet. Not until I get this dunk down.
I know I asked you this before, but aren't you on the volleyball team?
Yes!
Ah?
Bravo!
Who was that?
He's the one. Tonami Takefumi, the one from...
Okinawa with the same name as Tonami-kun.
He's nothing like him!! !!
It is him!
That stupid girl hasn't changed at all!
No matter. I have changed.
I got taller, I got stronger, I got over my diseases.
And I got thinner.
I'm not as I was when I was under her thumb.
I'll let her pay nice and slowly.
Whatcha looking at?
What are you looking at?
That was fast!
The results are out already.
Wow, Yukinon and Arima really live up to their reputations.
What's the matter, Tsubaki?
That dunk dude is up there too.
You're right. He must be smart.
Not bad.
How did you do?
I'm not smart enough to be among the top.
Aya, Rika, let's go!
I guess she grew up enough that she didn't deck me on the spot.
What the hell's his problem?
Shibahime figured it out.
After all, she is a wild animal.
What, Arima?! As in, that Arima-kun?! No way!
Hey, Arima! The grades are out!
Hurry hurry!
I made sure Sakura was here,
but I figured Arima-kun would be at some famous private school!
We're in the same high school?!
Arima-kun and I were in the same class in middle school.
He was my idol.
Look, we tied for first!
That's great. Now there'll be no hard feelings.
Hey, doesn't this look like I'm in third place?
What?
It looks third! And it looks like you're first! No fair!!
It's so unfair! Even if we put in the same effort Arima will always be ahead.
There's no hope with Miyazawa.
Oh, come on now, who cares?
Ow, my foot!
*Squish*
I can't believe you!
Aw, all that's left would be to marry you and get myself among the A's.
Arima Yokuni Arima Souichiro
Huh? What's the matter?
Oh, nothing...
One more point and I would've been first place by myself.
I made a careless mistake.
I made a stroke error on one Kanji.
Why do you make such stupid mistakes when you're so smart?
Arima-kun was different from the other kids from the very start.
You could just tell his good upbringing.
His fairness and gentle disposition.
His capacity as a leader.
It was like only he was surrounded in a special atmosphere.
Luckily for me, no bullying happened in his class.
Even that violent Sakura...
Hey, go buy me some juice!
Don't be mean to someone in my class.
Arima!
Oh fine. Later.
She wouldn't lift her hand against Arima.
Wow! Arima-kun, you're so cool!
You're really awesome!
And cool! Thanks, Arima-kun!
Arima!
That's Arima-kun, three years later...
Nice shot, Arima!
He's still so cool! He's beautiful!
Why are you blushing at another guy?
Let's go, Tonami!
Right!
Awesome, Tonami!
Oh, you're the Tonami-kun who just transferred into 1-B!
Did you used to live around here?
I know someone with the same name.
Um, th...that's me.
Really? I knew it!
You've changed so much,
I was afraid I had the wrong person.
Yeah, I've changed.
He remembered me.
When I had come back to this city only to get back at Sakura.
It made me so happy.
Arima, who are you bringing?!
This is Tonami-kun.
We were in the same junior high.
It's been a while since we last saw each other.
Is it okay if Tonami eats lunch with us?
Hmm, in that case, okay.
No way!
Don't be friends with any guy but me!
Stop suffocating me.
Well, this is Miyazawa-san, who's in my class...
Hi.
And this is Asaba.
But you can forget his name right away.
No way!
And Miyazawa and I are going out.
It's none of my business,
but Arima sure has strange tastes.
Oh, but I guess she's cute when she keeps her mouth shut.
Let's have lunch.
Okay Arima, say aah
What're you thinking?!
No, I don't want any!
C'mon, say aah!
No!
Hey, what the?! Hideaki you moron, let me go!
No!
Violating someone is so fun!
It's addictive.
Are you all idiots?
You're not eating with Sakura's gang today?
Sakura?
Yeah, I want to pay attention to just you sometimes.
Plus, this week...
What?
Aya-chan wrote this screenplay.
She wants us to perform it at the Culture Fair...
You should do it. I'd love to see it.
No way! You're just pulling my leg.
I can't act in front of people!
That's why I'm avoiding her!
What?
Are you trying to pit a play against my dinner show?
Shut up!
Your attitude when you talk about that pisses me off!
It looks like Arima...changed a little.
I really am back,
I really am back, for the first time in three years.
Sis is still running from Aya-chan in the days preparing for the Culture Fair.
But unrelated to that,
Tonami Takefumi's plans for revenge against?
And the weird friendship that develops...
See next Act, 14 Days Pt. 3!
