OP END
Sorry for the wait.
I can only make this.
Here.
Wow, awesome! It's twice-cooked pork.
I'm really hungry, so this is perfect.
I put something in for a hidden taste.
I wonder if you can tell.
Having a hidden taste; it sounds like the real thing.
I'm digging in!
It only has the miso flavour, or rather...
The hidden taste is not so hidden, or rather...
No, instead, the more you chew it, the hidden taste gets worse, or rather...
I'm really against this hidden taste!
shi kou kai wa gu cha gu cha ko n ran shaa ba dee bee doo bee, yeah!
ko nna... ko to... ha ji me te da yo
I just realised for the first time that I had fallen in love
All day long, it's only you, you, you; I just couldn't avoid it
Somehow, somehow I'm different from usual when I'm with you
Do we converse awkwardly? mutual love?
Nope, it's an unrequited love, whoops, we made eye contact
Something's making my heart beat faster sha ba da ba de bee doo wa ba dee ay
My train of thought derails with a *splat* *splat* shaaba deebee doobee, yeah!
This... is the... very first time for me
Do I have a fever, I wonder?
The awakening of love that you induced it was without pride
T-T-These stupid hands are shaking and from here, we'll proceed
No no no, I've messed up my words a bit and so there's an awkward silence
About your about your feelings I really want to know, it's an u-u-un-unrequited love
First love always in the school zone
A glittering light I will fall in love
I'm flying through the sky
U-U-U-U-Unrequited love!
This is actually pretty good...
Mio-chan, Mio-chan!
TL Note: Kappa, literally meaning river-child, is a water sprite found in Japanese folklore.
What the hell is this?
Kappa?
Why a kappa all of the sudden?
Moreover, what does she mean by is cool, isn't it?...
But...
Next time, I might want to draw something in fantasy that's interesting and strong.
Something like a Daidarabotchi and a kappa.
TL Note: Daidarabotchi is a gigantic demon in Japanese mythology.
Kappa... Heh, I guess he will be the uke.
TL Note: In yaoi, uke refers to the more feminine partner.
Kappa, kappa, huh?
Kappa...
Kappapaa... pa... pa...
Parasite.
With this, maybe we can just play shiritori.
TL note: Shiritori is a Japanese word game in which the players are required to say a word which begins with the final kana of the previous word.
Yukko.
Thanks.
Parashite?
TL Note: In Japanese, parasite is read as Perasaito, but Yukko read it as Parashite.
This is what a parashite's meant to be like?
Having this arrow means...
I see. She's inviting me to a game of shiritori.
I'll accept it.
Hmm... Parashite...
Te... Te... OK.
So big!
Moreover, a tengu...
She read parasite's to as te.
Oh, well. A tengu, huh?
Tengu... gu... gu... gu...
N-No way!
Tengo!!
What the hell is a tengo?! What's a tengo?!
No! Wait a minute!
There's no way a high school student would make such a childish mistake.
I mean, she already drew a picture of tengu and still wrote down what it was.
I don't get it.
I don't really understand, but...
I guess I'll go with go here.
Here.
What's with this Goku drawn out of boredom?
TL Note: Goku is a character from a classical Chinese novel Journey To The West.
Huh... Wait... Goku? I'm pretty sure I drew a tengu just now...
Well, I can understand how she could mistake gu for go.
I'll get juice from her later for this.
Now, it's u... u... u... OK!
A sea urchin? No, a rabbit.
TL Note: Sea urchin is uni, and rabbit is usagi, or usa for short, in Japanese.
It's a cow?!
TL note: Cow is ushi in Japanese.
This cow is beyond terrible...
Here.
Tongue! She came at me with the tongue!
TL note: In Japanese, tongue is shita.
Then, it's ta.
Ta... ta...
Taxi... Ta...
W-Why are you doing this?!
If you write it like this, it isn't a taxi. It's a taxy!!!
I'm just going to write down whatever works.
Oh, seafood has started to come up!
She's really up for it.
OK, OK, OK.
Oh, no!
I'll lose like this!
TL Note: There is no word in Japanese beginning with the sound n, so you lose if you use a word ending with the kana n in a game of shiritori.
No, this... I just have to do this...
Here.
Ah, there's nothing to do.
There's nothing to do, Sekiguchi.
OK, Sekiguchi, let's have a Isse no se match!
TL Note: Isse no se is a Japanese numbers game played using both hands.
I'll start!
Isse no two!
Sekiguchi...
There's nothing to do, anyway. Can't you play with me sometimes?
President.
Sekiguchi...
I forgot my homework and was made to stand in the hallway, Mogami river. By Yukko.
I can't believe I have to stand in the hallway just because I forgot my homework today...
How should I spend this time, Mogami river. By Yukko.
Wai...
E-Everyone! It's a deer... It's a deer...
W-Why is the principal is trying to catch the deer...?
W-Wai - Principal... D-Deer...
Principal!
W-Wait, everyone... The principal's... dying...
That's a... shika senbei?!
TL Note: Shika senbei are rice crackers specially made to feed deer.
W-Wai - Everyone, the principal is dy-dyin -
He got up.
He climbed up!
He jumped!
And falls down just like that!
He climbed up again!
He climbed down!
H-He's in a deadlock!
Principal!
Principal...
Wai - Everyone... Death... Principal... Death...
Uh... Wai - Um... Uh...
Wai - Everyone, listen!
Uh... Um... P-Prin...
Um... Prin...
Nothing new to report from the hallway!
She said those words from the bottom of her heart.
They were by no means to cover up for the principal, nor because explaining it would be too troublesome. Nothing like that.
Maybe she just wanted to show respect to the heroes who had just performed a fight to the death.
It's too early to gather the early-summer rain, Mogami river.
No idea what it means.
OK, then. Mio-chan will be the judge.
You don't need a judge for ten yen soccer.
You don't understand, do you? It's all about the feeling, the feeling.
Now, kickoff!
I guess it can't be helped.
Come at me from any angle!
OK...
First comes rock, next comes paper. Go splat like a pear, rock-paper-scissors!
Chomp.
I love it.
What should I do?
I caught a cockroach...
C-Carefully...
Anyway, I'll have to do it carefully...
I have to make sure this disgusting root of evil doesn't spread in the house again.
A plan... I have to go with the most perfect plan...
Ah, pesticide spray!
No, I can't.
It's not a one-hit-kill, so there's a chance that it will just run away.
Most of all...
I don't want to see it squirm!
Ah, that's right! What about detergent?
I'll cover the tea table with detergent to seal its movement, and then pinpoint it directly!
I-It will fly!
With nowhere to run, it'll definitely fly!
When it flies, it's over.
It'll blindly aim somewhere and hit people!
If this was to hit my body... or hit my face...!
No, wait...
I-If this was to get inside... get inside my mouth...
It's a one-shot rock and roll!
This is the worst kind of uneasiness.
I don't have any other choice.
The choice of lifting this bowl up might kill me!
Death or die!
There's...
There's no choice but to do that...
What are you doing?
Sa-Sakamoto-san!
Please save me!
I-Inside this, there is a r-roach... a roach.
What?
Could it be a cockroach?
I guess it can't be helped. All right. Leave it to me.
That'll save me.
Hey.
Yes?
What are you doing? I'll get it, so lift the bowl.
Yes?
No, I'm saying lift the bowl. Otherwise, I can't get it.
Hey!
W-What are you saying?! How could I lift the seal on the root of evil?! This is Pandora's box! The moment I lift it up, it's death or die!
No, no, no.
How am I supposed to get it without lifting up the bowl!?
Lift it up yourself!
As if I can!
W-What should I do?
Sakamoto-san has gone somewhere...
Nano!
What's today's snack?
Ah, good timing!
The professor is not bothered by bugs either, so surely she can...
Professor, i-it'd be nice if you could get rid of t-this cockroach inside this bowl!
Sure.
R-Rock and roll!
Sorry, then I shall leave it to you.
It's OK. I'll do it in one shot!
Men!
TL Note: Men is what you say after successfully hitting your opponent's head in kendo.
Oh, I hit the wrong one.
I-I'm... I'm seriously worried here, but this person is... this person is...
Seriously, I hate you, professor!
You're going to cry?
It's just a joke! Geez, there's no way I would hate you.
Professor, I love you.
Nano!
Geez, professor.
Nano!
Now, it's time to rock and roll!
Hey, it's hot, so can I get out?
Huh? We just got in.
But it's gotten hot...
Then let's get out after a count to ten.
20 log root 10!
Huh?
You said we can get out once we count to ten.
Uh... Um...
You have to say One, two...
What's with everyone? Just because they have cram school, they all leave.
Sekiguchi, you're bored as well, right?
Huh? Come to think of it, didn't you go to cram school, too?
You've got to be kidding!
Delicious!
Yukko, how's the curry?
Yeah, it's almost done.
I'm quite hungry.
Yeah, me, too!
Mai-chan, how are things over there?
I foresee a big one.
This will be a feast.
All right! It seems like it's ready.
Thanks for waiting.
The extremely delicious super-curry is complete.
I think it will take a little longer over here.
We should have started these before the curry.
Well, they say, Even if a baby is crying from hunger, don't remove the lid.
Ah, we should have brought mayonnaise.
You really need mayonnaise for curry.
M-Mayo-Ma -
Yukko, what do you like with curry?
Just kidding.
No... It's not like that... T-This is... not what you think...
I still have - Look, I still have tokoroten!
TL Note: Tokoroten are strips of gelidium jelly (agar).
T-Tokoroten... Just kidding.
What is your...
Mi-Mio-chan...
What is your...
What is the colour of your blood?!
Sorry, Mai-chan!
There's not any curry or rice for lunch!
Mai-chan...
There's still tokoroten, if you want...
Mai-chan!
Release.
Well, then There's one tokoroten here.
Only one?!
I think we should take turns eating it.
However, as we are to blame, Mai-chan, you should start.
Rock-paper-scissors!
Just make sure you don't eat all of it in one bite!
That's upsetting to me... I'm not a demon, you know.
I'll dig in first.
I choked.
That's right! Let's play cards!
Let's not!
If things continue this way, this'll end as a disappointing camping trip!
Let's play cards at the very last moment and give it a happy ending!
That's right!
Oh, what's up?
I totally forgot!
Adults drink alcohol at times like these, right?
T-That's right.
Hey, Mai-chan, don't you agree?
Actually, I brought some!
T-That can't be, Mio-chan.
That's right.
A delinquent. There's a delinquent here!
Tada!
A-Any bottle is fine!
Mio-chan stop it! You'll die!
We still have Mai-chan's left!
This is cider.
Exit the bath, drink milk, act drunk.
I'm a peso!
I'm ten yen!
I'm wadoukaichin!
TL Note: Wadoukaichin is Japan's first circulated coinage, minted in 708 CE.
No, no. A person's value is not measured by money!
The next Nichijou is the seventh! Look forward to it!
