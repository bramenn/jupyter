Water collects into stagnant pools.
I've always loved watching it spill out all at once.
Breaking free, liberated, rushing out.
The energy stored up during its stagnation bursts forth.
Everything springs into action!
Tamaki Mari-san, it's already noon.
What was it?
I dreamed you put a wet towel on my face in an attempt to kill me, Mom.
That does sound scary...
I told you yesterday to tidy up your room.
Do not open without permission! -Rin
Wait!
Ow...
Huh?

Things I want to do in high school.
Keep a diary.
Skip school just once.
Go on a journey without a plan.

So?
Well, I just realized, I'm in my second year of high school and I haven't done anything!
You didn't do anything in middle school either, Kimari.
Exactly!
Student Activities
I knew I had to start doing stuff when I got into high school!
That it isn't good sleepwalking through life...

I only have so much time, so I'm wondering,
where did all that determination go?
So, what are you gonna do?
I decided...
Get the most out of youth.
I'm gonna make it happen!
Expressions to offer advice
(Why don't you __)
Tokyo?
Yeah. First I'll go to Tokyo, then I'll start my journey from there.
Drifting from place to place on a whim!
When?
Ouch!
Enjoy your trip.
Tomorrow?
Yeah. I'm g-gonna ditch school.
Well, that sounds fine.
I'm skipping school, though! Playing hooky!
Yeah, and it's not that big a deal.
Not that big a deal?
Hey, Kimari... have you never ditched before?
You mean you have, Megu-chan?
Sure I have. Everyone has.
Incredible!
Don't look at me like that.
So, ever gone on a journey without a plan?
I guess not.
Then... then... then...
I'm not going with you.
How'd you know that's what I meant?
It was obvious. That's just the way you think, Kimari.
But it's meaningless, unless you go by yourself, in my opinion.
I see...
Just go.
I'll help you.
Okay!
Tamaki
I'm back!
So excited!
Tomorrow, I'll get changed in the bathroom at the station!
And then...
The beach, the beach!
Crap. They'll know I'm from Gunma...
What are you doing, Sis?
Nothing!
Heading out already?
What's the big bag for?
I had to borrow gym clothes from a friend.
Again?
See you later!
Don't call me.
I had to!
You don't have to worry. I already called the school.
With my mimicry skills.
For real?
If you have to stay overnight, I'll back up whatever story you use.
Stop worrying and go.
Sure!
I'm heading out on a journey.
I'll change clothes in the bathroom.
I'll get on a train that goes the opposite direction from school.
While everyone goes to school like normal,
I alone will burst free.
I'll go on a journey without a plan.
To a place I've never seen before...
No loose pants! Lift them higher! Both your pants and your grades!
What are you doing here?
Well... I mean, it was raining.
And I started thinking, you can't just skip school...
Isn't there anywhere you wanted to go?
Sure, there is! Lots of places!
Kyoto, Okinawa, Hokkaido...
Then why didn't you go there?
Well... you know...
A plane could crash.
A shinkansen could explode...
And a meteor could fall at any time.
I know that! I know!
Then why didn't you go?
You got scared?
You know. It's the thing I've always done...
Rin
When I try to join clubs, when I try to learn new things,
when I thought about taking the entrance exam for a really good school...
I always chicken out at the very last minute.
When I'm about to try something I've never done before,
I start thinking, What if it doesn't go well?
I really don't want to fail.
What if I end up regretting it?
When the moment comes, every single time...
Rin
Hurry!
Want to eat
Well, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.
I hate it, though.
I'll be back by curfew
I made the usual
I really hate that part of me.
See you.
Sure.
Next time, want to hang out somewhere?
Sure!
Hey, you dropped this!
Yen
Are you kidding me?
How much is there?
I counted... it was exactly one million!
A million?!
Why did you keep it? Why didn't you take it to the police?
I freaked out!
Sure you did...
I'm serious! I seriously freaked out!
And I think... the person who dropped it was wearing a uniform for our school.
What year?
I'm not sure...
I only caught a glimpse of her from behind.
See her?
I don't... think so.
Her hair was about as long as that girl's, and I think she was pretty.
Anything else?
She smelled good. Conditioner, maybe?
Not much to go on...
Well, it's okay.
I don't think there are many girls with hair that long.
I'm going to check the first-year classrooms.
Okay...
Ethics
I need to calm down...
That smell...
A million...

A million...
Yen!

Antarctica?
A Place Further Than the Universe Kobuchizawa Takako
My mother wrote this book.
She was a member of an Antarctic research expedition.
She went missing when I was in middle school, though...
I see.
They never found her,
and she didn't leave much behind for me,
so I'm going to go and find her.
To Antarctica? Can you even do that?
That's what everyone says.

You really think they'll let a child do that?
Don't you realize how much that would cost?
And that's what the million was for?
I've been working part-time jobs.
I'm going to go.
I'll go, then rub it in the faces of everyone who said I couldn't.
After I finished my entrance exams and got into high school, I made up my mind.
Antarctica, she said! Antarctica!
Don't you think that's amazing?
The furthest ends of the Earth!
That will be 566 yen.
Kobuchizawa Shirase?
Yeah! You know her, Megu-chan?
The girl in class 2 who they call Antarctica, right?
Antarctica?
Coming Nationwide This Winter!!
Anniversary Collaboration Campaign
She's pretty famous, you know.
Ever since she got to high school,
she's talked about nothing but going to Antarctica.
That is what she said...
There's no way she's going, though.
But she has a million yen!
And she said she was totally going!
She can't, though.
Come on, it's Antarctica.
You'd need to be part of an expedition to go.
Then, why?
I dunno...
I mean, that's why people call her a weirdo.
She doesn't make any friends.
She spends all her time after school working and saving up money.
Wanna hang out somewhere?
Oh... not today.

The Antarctic Express?
Where's our payment?
We were making sure no one stole it.
We hear you've got some money on you.
Could you lend us a little? Just a little...
E-Excuse me!
K-Kobuchizawa-san, the teacher's calling you.
They gotta ask some questions about the money.
Really?
Way to spoil the fun...
You were lying?
Don't scare me like that...
I thought the teacher really found out about it!
But I gave you a knowing look!
How was I supposed to know?
But why were you there? Just happened to be passing by?
Actually, I happened to see you, and I wanted to talk to you.
About what?
I want to encourage you!
I wanted to do something when I got into high school.
Something I'd never done. Something amazing!
But I never did anything,
and whenever I try, I end up getting scared and quit.
So... I think it's really amazing to work hard at something,
even when everyone discourages you and makes fun of you!
Just let people say what they want.
Wanting to show them up just fires me up even more.
I think it's for the best.
Isn't there any way I can help you?
Just say the word!
Will you go with me, then?
People have said that to me in the past.
But they all go away before long.
They decide it's impossible,
their friends get them to stop...
Or they get scared.
I think that's normal.
We're in high school, after all.
They have classes to get to, and friends.
I'm not like them! My feelings about this aren't that frivolous...
I'm checking out boats.
Come here this Saturday.
If you do, I'll believe you're serious.

I'm going on a journey.
This time, I am going on a journey.
I'll get on the train that goes opposite the usual way,
so that I can see things I've never seen before...
I'm scared; it's true...
I want to call it off...
It might all turn out to be pointless...
But...
I'm finally going on a journey!
I got a picture of Mt. Fuji!
Wow, it's so big!
