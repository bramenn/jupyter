Hey all you viewers out there!
When you're watching Fairy Tail keep the room nice and bright,
and sit back from the screen, all right?
Previously on Fairy Tail!
Reitei Lyon is Gray's former fellow pupil and is plotting to resurrect Deliora!
And it was their master, Ul, who sealed it using a spell that turns your own body into ice, Iced Shell!
You're the one who killed Ul!
Lyon... Do we live together or die together?
That's right, we can do it!
Let's go for even more who-knows-what!!
The door to mystery is right in front of us
The whole world's a wonderland
which we're already wondering!!!
This excitement gets my heart racing
It's wonderful!
Who am I, I wonder?
What is real, I wonder?
Why can't I see tomorrow, I wonder?
The only part leveling up is my curiosity
We can't just throw away our daily life together, right?
Tell me! S. O. W.
Living itself will be our training!
So, we can make it!
Let's search for even more who-knows-what!
We can't be satisfied with just the normal answers
This magical wonder life
Our future is wondering!!!
We'll do our best living our life
the way we want to!
Let's wondering!!!
Do it!
You don't have the guts to die!
Too bad.
Gray!
Natsu, Erza, everyone at Fairy Tail...
It's up to you now...
Sorry, but I'm making my exit!
This is... the end!
Iced...
You idiot!
Natsu!
You break into my fight spouting responsibility? Give me a break!
Don't be takin' my kill!
Your kill?
I'm the one that's gonna beat him!
Didn't I tell you that I'd take him down?
And did I ever say, Yes, Roger that, Sir?
Why you little...
You wanna go?
I have to be the one that finishes him off!
I'm prepared to die!
Since when is dying finishing a battle?
Well?
Ain't that just running away, huh?!
W-What's that?
Galuna Island, the Final Battle!
Take that!
Do not falter!
We must not allow anyone to get in the way of Reitei-sama!
What is that sound?
Oh, no!
The ruins have un-tilted themselves!
What the heck?!
Now the light of the moon will land on Deliora again!
Sorry for the interruption.
Zalty, is this your doing?
The moon will be out soon, so I returned the temple to normal.
What the heck is he?
After all my hard work tilting it!
How'd you fix it back up?
How did you fix it back up!
I suppose we should begin the Moon Drip ceremony.
Ignored?!
Oh, it's on, masked-man!
Hold it, bub!
Natsu!
I'm gonna wallop that bastard a million times.
You handle things here!
You lost last time, and it's a disgrace.
Yeah...
Not for you.
I know.
For all of Fairy Tail!
My, what noisome fellows.
Did you count on Natsu stopping me from using Iced Shell?
No. I wouldn't imagine that guy getting anywhere near that kind of magic.
So you just planned on taking it?
Exactly. But I would have been saved.
Once I realized that, I said Do it.
I knew it...
Even if I were to be trapped in the ice, I have allies with the same goals as myself.
And this is the island where you can use the Moon Drip to undo Iced Shell.
I was careless.
Iced Shell is powerless here, isn't it?
And yet you still wish to defeat me?
You cannot win against-
Stop this already.
What?
Give up on Deliora.
What foolishness...
First you threaten, and then you persuade?
Does your guild have some dentist that de-fangs you all?
Lyon, listen carefully.
Ul is alive!
Iced Shell was a spell that turned her body into ice.
The ice that sealed Deliora...
The very same ice that you're trying to melt now... is Ul herself!
Ul became that ice and lives on today!
I apologize for not telling you before.
I promised Ul that I wouldn't.
If he knew that I became the ice, he'd probably spend his entire life trying to undo the spell.
Gray...
So, Lyon, stop this!
I know that fairy tale.
But that ice is no longer Ul.
It's just some frozen remains!
You knew?
You honestly believe that Ul is still alive?
Grow up already.
You knew, and yet...
What of it?
Impossible! How can you move with such a wound?
That's it.
Huh?
I've had enough of trying to save you!
So you'll attempt to defeat me, the elder pupil?
I've been holding back for my battle with Deliora.
I don't want to waste my magic power, see.
We'll settle it this way.
So, no magic, then?
Fine by me.
Aim for your opponent's weak points when fighting.
Ul taught us that, remember?
Don't you dare speak that name!
Hold it right there, you masked-bastard!
How did you fix the ruins?!
You think that'd work on me?
As you can see, that is how I returned the ruins back how they were.
What kind of magic was that?
One of the Lost Magics.
Magic so powerful and with such grave side-effects that they have been erased from history itself.
From history?
Your Dragon Slayer magic is also so.
Mine?
He disappeared!
Where'd he go? Damn it!
What's the matter? You were gonna finish it with your fists, remember?
Oh yeah... There was a guy I fought like this before...
This is the end!
Stand up!
Stand up!
Natsu!
Stand up!
You're the one that should stand up!
This is the end!
I win.
Wait!
This isn't over yet!
Fine by me...
In the end, you were no match for me.
Wait!
This ain't over yet!
You should have died a long time ago!
I can't lose, no way!
Not while I haven't shown him I'm the best!
I'm not gonna lose!
I'm not gonna lose!
Me either!
Me either!
I can't stand... losing to you!
Shut up!
I'm the winner!
I'll crush you!
I'll destroy you!
I won't lose! I'll defeat you!
That's enough outta you!
I don't know why...
But that sky was so blue it got on my nerves...
Lucy, have you noticed?
There may be a lot of them, but their magical power is weak.
Exactly.
They only have 5 real wizards among them.
Well, just great... I can't get serious with these guys.
Should you be saying that?
So, can you handle it?
Leave it to me!
Gate of the Giant Crab, I open thee!
Cancer!
Aren't you...
Erza, my lady, for what might I have this pleasure-snip?
My lady? say what?!
And what's with the -snip?!
And I'm the one who summoned you!
It's a triple-take!
Anyway, make them all powerless to fight!
Okay-ebi... -snip.
Me being brought to my knees by someone like Gray? I couldn't bear it!
Then get over here.
Ice Make Snow Dragon!
You broke our promise!
Who gives a crap?
Deliora'll be resurrected soon anyway!
No one will be able to stop me!
We're going to stop you!
Even when Zalty has started the Moon Drip?
Don't underestimate Natsu.
You guys can't even hold a candle to that jerk.
Finally.
Found you!
Let's start by burning you to a crisp!
Those are some fine fighting words.
But... How did you know I was here?
I've got a good nose.
And you smell like women's perfume for some reason...
You see, I must ensure Deliora is resurrected no matter what.
Just give it up already! It's not going to happen.
Oh yeah? And why is that?
Gray will blow that guy away, and I'll blow you away.
One million times.
And that'll be that.
We'll see...
L-Light?!
Who is above doing the ceremony?
With just a single person the moon drip effect is quite weak...
But we've already gathered plenty of moonlight.
Just a tiny bit more, and...
See?
Oh, crap!
The ice is melting off Deliora!
I have to do something about the guy on top!
I will not let you escape.
Chasing after me was a mistake, you see.
My little Salamander...
Excellent work. Let us hurry along.
Right.
W-Wait!
We can't let you interfere with Reitei-sama!
Those hair ornaments...
You are the citizens of Brago, aren't you?
Have a score to settle?
You sure about that?
If you use fire magic here, it will accelerate the ice melting off Deliora!
If you could use fire magic to melt the ice, then you wouldn't have had to go through all this trouble!
It'll be fastest to beat you here, then smash the guy up on top.
I am surprised at how quickly you can think on your feet in the midst of a battle.
The ruins are shaking again...
The Moon Drip ceremony has begun. The ice has started melting off Deliora.
Then, Ul's...
I suppose this is it.
You were not able to stop me.
Do you have any idea how long I've waited for this moment?
I spent ten years gathering allies, knowledge, then I finally learned of this island.
The island where you can gather the light of the moon, Galuna!
We transported Deliora from Brago!
That was three years ago.
You've been doing this pointless crap for three years?
Pointless?!
That's rich, coming from someone who's been playing around in some guild for ten years!
I just trusted what Ul told me!
There are a ton of wizards stronger than me in the countries to the west.
And I finally arrived at Fairy Tail...
It was true. There were a ton of amazing wizards.
I couldn't believe it!
Impossible. Iced Shell is a magic that is done by one's own will.
No magic done by a third-party has the power to melt the ice.
But there are a ton of amazing wizards here, right?
Well, there may be one way, though...
No, wait!
It's no good. Melting the ice would be no different than killing Ul.
When I think back on it, I realize that gramps was going to mention the Moon Drip, I bet.
And to think that it would be her own pupil that is trying to kill Ul! You've disappointed me.
Say what you will.
I've lived my entire life for this day.
How can a pupil surpass his teacher when she's already dead! Think about it!
It's Deliora! If I can destroy the one thing that defeated our teacher, then I can surpass her!
That ambition of yours is nice, but you haven't realized you've taken a wrong turn along the way!
You think someone as blind as you could beat Ul?
Think again! Not in 100 years!
Ice Make...
Ice Make Prison!
This is what you are, Lyon.
What?
A caged beast who knows nothing of the world.
Foolishness!
I'll destroy that Creation Magic of yours!
Creations made with one hand are out of balance.
So when it counts they don't have the power.
Ice Cannon!
Ul taught us that, remember?
G-Gray...
Ow!
I should've braced it before...
My ears are ringing!
What the heck is that sound?
It's so loud!
Here it comes!
T-That voice...
I can never forget it...
Deliora...
Damn it... Has it been resurrected?
I've got no choice then...
Iced Shell!
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
chasing after your profile left only in my revolving dreams
You said, I never want to see your face again, when you left me
But the tears on your cheek said it all
Every time you felt like you'd be swallowed up in the waves of contradiction
you always held back your tears, you know?
What a strong person, they said, but everyone overestimated you
and before you knew it you lost sight of who you really are
Then the sun I thought would always be near me collapsed
and the light shut off...
Rubbing out the truths and the lies of one day, altogether
Merry-go-round
I greet the morning,
still, ironically, chasing after your profile in my revolving dreams
Professor Happy's Fairy Tail Lecture!
Today we'll be telling you the secrets of Erza, the Armored Wizard!
Called Titania, Erza fights by requiping different weapons and magic armor one after another.
She has some swimsuits and other weird clothes, but she's really strong!
Still she has times when she doesn't listen to people.
Until next time!
Stand, Bow, Aye!
Natsu, you ate the fish I was planning on having, didn't you?
Oh, my bad... I'll give you the next one I catch, okay?
Don't bother! Our friendship is over!
Oh, I see. It's too bad, I was hoping to take you fishing with me, but...
We could also make up.
Next time: Burst!
Wait, didn't you just say our friendship was over?
A cat's short term memory is very poor.
That's sure convenient for you...
