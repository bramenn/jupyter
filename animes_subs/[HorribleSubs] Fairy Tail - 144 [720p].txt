There's an emergency message from the Detention Corps!
The new Oracion Seis's aim isn't the destruction of churches!
They're after Celestial Spirit Wizards who are being sheltered there!
Our top priority is finding them first and protecting them!
Suddenly gotten a lot busier around here...
What?! Our Michelle is...?!
Not definitely an impostor,
but it's highly probable.
After all, we've got the real one right here.
Understood! I'll pass it on to Master and Lucy.
We'll take this girl to a nearby hospital.
What the hell's going on?!
What does this mean?
Anyway, we've got to contact Natsu and the others!
Do they have long-distance communication cards?
Each team has one.
Even Elfman's got one.
It's terrible! We got word that the Six Generals are attacking Kardia Cathedral!
What?!
This is bad. None of us are over there!
We'll go. Bisca...
Right.
Please watch Asuka for us.
Natsu! Lucy! Elfman!
Michelle is an impostor! Be careful!
Hey! Can you hear me?! Somebody answer!
Super! Hot! Punch!
I hit the jackpot!
If they go down together, it's convenient for me.
Still, something about it doesn't sit right.
Why, after all this time?
For what purpose...?
Get back, Michelle! I promise I'll protect you!
I've been having so much fun playing with you all
that I forgot the important work I have to do!
Please excuse me for now...
It's Oracion Seis!
Alright, let's do this all at once! Come on!
There it is!
Bombdrop Bonus! Boom-boom-boom!
Dammit!
Why destroy the church?!
W-What did you do?!
Bastard!
Unleashed Despair!
Sand Slash!
It's useless. I can hear you.
Well, I can...
I'm telling you...
Gotcha.
Sand Trap!
I got the idea from Sugar Boy's mucus!
Erza! Go!
I told you. I can hear you!
Shatter!
Max!
You make me sick.
Making like you have a beautiful friendship...
Bastard...
Cubelious is gone.
I no longer have any friends.
I heard that... Your sadness...
But people can get stronger by overcoming their sadness.
As if you know anything...
There's no way you can comprehend the pain that's in my heart.
Don't be so sure!
Everyone bears pain in their heart.
Yes. Everyone...
This way!
We found the Celestial Spirit Wizard and have her in protective custody!
Alright! Take her to headquarters, quickly!
I've been so busy here, I forgot my purpose...
Titania. One of these days, we'll settle this for good.
Good job.
I found him. I captured the Celestial Spirit Wizard.
The Anti-Link amplitude limiter.
I'm going to activate it.
You...!
Beautiful...
Even if you sever my biological link, there are more of us...
According to the information he got out of Father Fabrizio...
Yay! What fun!
At last, our prayers will be answered.
Your doctrine is being misused?!
What does that mean?
Before I explain that...
Fine. I'll go along with it.
Why?
There's some kind of doubt, right?
I don't really understand how males think.
What are you talking about, the misuse of your doctrine?!
What is Zentopia plotting?!
Before we departed,
Cardinal Rapowant gave us individual missions!
Rapowant?
Cardinal... That's one of the church's head honchos, right?
Dan and Mary were to interfere with you...
Sugar Boy was to stand by, prepared in case of an emergency...
And Gatman...
Who's that?!
He's like the newcomer. In Coco's place.
What?! Did something happen to Coco?!
She was imprisoned as a traitor to Legion!
What?!
She backed you people up or something.
Anyway, I don't know about the mission that Gatman was given.
But I have a really bad feeling about it.
According to my calculations,
when that Cleaner came out, it meant there's a disturbing movement within Zentopia.
Coco...
She told him she hates cats.
So he was rejected? Lily wears his broken heart on his sleeve...
Don't interrupt the conversation with a cooked-up drama!
Okay. I'm sorry.
There's one more thing!
The strange mission Byro-sama and I were given!
Strange?!
The order itself, but most especially, we weren't told to get the Infinity Clock back!
Even though stopping them is the most important thing right now!
I see. That is strange.
Right now, we need to join forces!
So you came here to look to Carla's precognition for help...
Even with all this, Byro-sama's allegiance hasn't crumbled.
But I...
You were a worthier opponent last time, Sammy!
Your techniques were aimless and misguided!
You'll never be able to beat me that way.
First, you need to get rid of the hesitation that's in your heart.
Scatter!
Damn him...
I can still stand, asshole!
Silly man. No matter how many times you attack, the outcome will be the same.
That's enough!
He can't... No wizard can beat you!
That's true...
In my Phantom Lord days, maybe I would've given up already,
but unfortunately for you, I'm a Fairy Tail wizard now.
Even if you beat the crap outta me, my heart won't break that easily!
Right, Juvia?!
Thank you for buying some time, Gajeel-kun.
Juvia has recovered.
What's this? You think this will snare me?
Juvia won't let go.
Scary! Scatter!
Wha...?!
Hey! What is this?! You're getting tangled up with me?!
Would you let go of me, you...?!
Juvia won't let go! Juvia will endure this!
Gajeel-kun!
Comin'!
You scatter, son of a bitch!
Yeesh.
The timing could've been a little better, huh?
If it had been Gray-sama, the timing would've been perfect.
Is that right?
Incredible. They took down Gatman the Cleaner...
Hey, wake up! How long are you gonna sleep, Erigor?!
Don't be that violent with him...
We've gotta ask him this!
Hey! Tell us what your aim is!
Where's the Infinity Clock?!
I don't know. I was in a daze... What was I doing?
You just got your memories back, so you must not be thinking clearly yet.
You were in prison before...
That's right. When was it... I had a hideous nightmare...
It felt like somebody sneaked into my dream...
After that, I acted as the Grim Reaper.
Sneaked into your dream...
Then it was probably a kind of magic that uses dreams to control people.
Yeah. Little by little, it must have influenced his brainwaves and then controlled his unconscious mind.
I did as I was told, offering up my memories,
and in exchange received the magic power of mastery over weather phenomenon.
But forgetting everything... was painful.
It was the hardest thing I've ever been through. Mighty power comes at a high price,
but that...
Then I heard your voice.
I have no intention of throwing in with you, but let me be grateful.
S-Sure...
Wait a second!
When Cana used divination to decide these teams, she said something...
She said, I don't know why, but I'm so sleepy...
Then unbeknownst to her, Cana-san was also manipulated through her dreams!
So right from the start, we were paired up into teams that were favorable to them!
Oh, no!
We fell right into a trap!
Befitting of well-known Celestial Spirit Wizard, Will Neville...
Even in death, he's protected by powerful magic.
But that effect is about to run out.
Stop right there!
I don't care what your goal is, we're not going to let you accomplish it!
You've sniffed me out already?
Amusing.
Brain II of the new Oracion Seis, I presume?
Here I come!
How about this?! Omnidirectional Expansion!
Garbage.
Al! Hang in there just a little longer!
No one can stop me.
Now!
One shot, one down!
Bisca!
She's a good shot.
But she lacks the resolve to shoot someone.
In order to achieve something, you have to pay a high cost.
You two are lacking.
Lacking in readiness to lose something!
Alright, three in a row!
Anti-Link activate!
Bastard, what did you do?!
Something that doesn't concern you, Byro-sama.
All you have to do is carry out your mission, right?
What?!
I'm your opponent here!
Okay! Your old pal, Lightning Bonus!
How?!
The sin of attacking a church is too serious!
Talons of the Fire Dragon!
What did you do?! Now I can't use my Slot Magic!
Where did my identity go?!
I was finally able to hit you, asshole!
Now I'm gonna pay you back for everything up to now!
Wing Slash of the Fire Dragon!
Plus...
Roar of the Fire Dragon!
What is this... feeling?
I've got a really bad feeling...
Nee-san... It's okay.
I'm here for you.
The scream we heard came from over here!
What is this?! What's happening?!
What did Cobra do?
The Celestial Spirit Wizards' Anti-Link is complete?
W-What are you talking about?!
The severing of the biological link.
Great Neville,
the amplitude limiters have all been unleashed.
The nightmare that you saw is now going to...
It will blanket the world!
The chaos that had been sealed away is now unleashed upon the world!
It's the beginning of the nightmare that can never be awakened from!
The end is in our hands!
The end is in our hands!
What is that? What kind of a joke is that?
The sound of bells...
Unleashing the Infinity Clock...?
That's the clock? It's too damn big!
The Infinity Clock was hidden right over Zentopia Cathedral.
What do you mean?
That's the starting point of the doctrine that was sealed away from Zentopia history.
The intersection between the beginning and end of goodwill and malice.
Everything has gone as Cardinal Rapowant as well as the archbishop have commanded.
I don't care what their real intentions are and it isn't necessary to know.
For the sake of the doctrine, for the sake of Zentopia...
We won.
Look at that! It's a fish! Though it doesn't look good to eat...
So we were too late?
While I was wavering, this happened?!
What's going to happen next?!
Where are you going, Sammy?!
Zentopia Cathedral!
I'm going to confirm the truth with my own eyes!
Wait! We haven't heard yet what kind of order you and Byro got!
Sammy...
Coco...
What the hell is this?!
The Infinity Clock has begun to work.
What?! We have to do something to stop it!
But I have my own mission to carry out.
That's to bring you back with me, Lucy Heartfilia.
Why?! After all this, what do you want with me?!
I don't understand it either.
However, it's my duty to obey.
You're not gettin' Lucy!
We don't have the time for this right now!
Can't you see what's over us?! What are you talking about, mission?!
Even you must know what you should really be doing right now!
Byro, what are you hesitating for? Don't think!
All you need is the doctrine and loyalty... All you have to do is what you were ordered!
You!
When we were fighting Nirvana...
My name is Klodoa.
I was then and am now the seventh member of Oracion Seis, the brains behind the group.
The seventh member?
Then, um... Aren't you one member short?
It's no longer necessary to hide it anymore. Come, the time is ripe!
Throw away your temporary form and reveal your true name right here and now!
Michelle...
What are you talking about?! You're just trying to confuse us again, aren't you?!
This girl is Michelle Lobster! She's like a little sister to me! She's family!
She embarked on a journey to search for me so she could deliver my father's memento!
Don't worry! I'm not gonna be taken in by that jerk's baloney!
Michelle...
Come on... Tell me he's lying...
Come on!
Hey.
Lucy-nee-san...
I'm sorry.
Mi...chelle...
No. I'm a member of the new Oracion Seis. Imitatia, mistress of mimicry and deception.
To gather the scattered pieces of the Infinity Clock, we needed all of you.
That's why I came to you, Nee-san, as Michelle Lobster.
What are you saying? I don't understand!
We attacked those churches
to destroy the biological links that were spread all over
and to release the sealed-up Infinity Clock.
With that accomplished now, we only need you, Lucy-nee-san.
What happened?
I-I see! You're being manipulated by magic!
I'll...
Get back, Lucy.
So it was all a lie?
Who knows?
Answer me!
Stop it, Natsu!
Suddenly a sneak attack?! That's our girl!
Byro, carry out the order you received from Lapowant.
Take Lucy Heartfilia back with you.
I don't need you to tell me my orders, wench.
I'm loyal to Zentopia's...
Th-That's the archbishop's...
Whoever holds that gold seal has the same authority as the archbishop.
Be aware that my orders are the archbishop's orders.
Y-Your wish is my command.
It would be dangerous to let that man live.
No. We're going to bring him back as well.
I'm sure he'll be of some use, as a hostage if nothing else.
Yes. As it pleases you.
However, mercy is forbidden, Imitatia-sama.
I know that.
Wait! Michelle... I...
What's this? There was one more here. Did he escape?
What?! I can't hear you well... Explain it one more time!
Hey! Elfman!
I'm sleepy...
That's unusual. You always sleep like a log.
Recently, I've had trouble fallin' asleep.
I keep havin' these weird dreams.
Nightmares? You, Natsu?
What's that reaction?! Is somethin' funny?
No, I'm moved that you have that kind of sensitivity, Natsu.
Next time: Real Nightmare!
Alright, I'm gonna show you what a real nightmare is!
W-W-W-Wait! We can talk this out!
Sorry, I don't have that kind of sensitivity!
