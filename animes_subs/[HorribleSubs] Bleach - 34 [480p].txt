Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burdens too much for one to bear
Dont give up on me, please dont turn me away
Whoa!
Ill hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age
My love for you is timeless
Pain that wont heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts bitterness replaced
Ill never smile again”
Ill never let love in”
Dont ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away,
so just stay, please stay with me Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you? Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Ichigo!
Hey Ichigo! Answer! Hey!
Someone's coming! Threemaybe more.
Let's retreat for now.
We can't let them find us.
Yes!
That's
Lieutenant Abarai!
Lieutenant Abarai!
Are you all right?! Sir!
It can't be Abarai can't have lost.
His opponent seems to have gotten away.
Shall we give chase?
No, first we must get Abarai treated.
Get a stretcher.
We're taking him back to the barracks.
Healing power? Without using any medicine?
No, it's different with us.
With other Soul Reapers, their spiritual power is mostly for combat.
But those of us in Squad 4 have healing power as well.
Although that's about all we can do.
I see And? How is Ichigo?
It's very bad.
He took direct hits from a Zanpaku-to of a Lieutenant
It's to be expected.
Normally, he'd have died instantly.
He has an unbelievable will to live.
I'll heal him without fail. Please give me some time.
I'll heal him in one night.
That's!
When I found him, he was already in this condition.
If only I'd found him sooner and assisted his fight.
Don't blame yourself, Kira.
In any case, I'll contact Squad 4.
I'll ask for emergency relief.
There's no need.
Captain Kuchiki!
Put him in prison.
B-But Abarai fought Ryoka by himself. And yet
No excuses.
If he entered a fight alone, defeat is absolutely forbidden.
I have no use for a fool who did not understand that.
He is an eyesore. Take him away.
P-Please wait! How can you say
Lieutenant Abarai Stop!
Kira!
My deepest apologies!
My deepest apologies.
Hinamori, let's follow his orders, and take Abarai to prison.
But!
Oh, so scary.
Captain Ichimaru!
Why'd he have to talk like thathuh?
He's as scary as ever the Captain of Squad 6.
Well, don't worry. I'll call Squad 4.
Really?
Of course. Come with me, Izuru.
Yes sir!
Thank you very much.
Wow, Abarai got messed up pretty good.
Hitsugaya!
Hey, hey I'm a Captain, too.
And you're gonna address me like that?
Never mind that!
How come all you Captains creep around so silently?!
And why are you here anyway, Hitsugaya?!
Yeswhy are you here? Without your Lieutenant?
I came to warn you.
Warn?
Be careful of Squad 3.
Squad 3? You mean, Kira?
I mean Ichimaru.
But I'm not sure about Kira, either.
The alarm sounds quite conveniently these days.
I don't understand just what you mean.
And you think you can get away with that?
You should not underestimate me.
Anyway, it won't hurt to be careful.
Especially
The situationis critical.
This means that we are short one Lieutenant
in the Thirteen Court Guard Squads.
We can no longer leave this to the lower-ranked members.
Therefore, in view of the situation,
I will not discipline Ichimaru for his independent actions earlier.
Thank you very much.
Furthermore, I will allow senior officers, including Lieutenants,
to carry their Zanpaku-to at all times
as well as allow full release of their Zanpaku-to in the Court, as in wartime.
Carry the Zanpaku-to all the time, huh?
Full release as in wartime, huh? I cont be happier.
If someone hadn't allowed Ryoka to escape,
we wouldn't be talking about this now.
C'mon, stop that talk.
Yes,'cuz he'll be my prey from now.
Men
This is all-out war.
Oh, you're awake, Ichigo.
HanataroI
Please don't move. Your wounds haven't closed yet.
Wounds?
Oh rightI fought Renji
Ichigo!
Thanks, Hanataro. I'll be fine now.
What are you saying? You can't get up!
Chad and the others don't know where Rukia is.
I must go and
Ichigo! You can't!
You see? You're not recovered yet!
If you go out in your condition, you're certain to die!
Ichigo!
If I can knock him out like that, how can he be all right?
Sleep until you're healed, idiot!
Ganju! Oh no he's got another wound now.
You're so rough, Ganju.
Shut up! I stopped him, didn't I?!
Don't complain about how I did it.
But
I didn't think that the slash across his left shoulder and chest
would be this shallow.
I thought it would definitely be a fatal wound
Was it because of
that mask inside his clothes?
To be able to stop Lieutenant Abarai's slash
I wonder what it is? And
This mask looks too much like a Hollow.
Doesn't it, Ichigo?
Excuse me
Huh?
Can you tell me what's going on outside?
Just a little is fine
We don't know the details either.
But we've heard that Lieutenant Abarai was taken down.
Huh?! Renji?
I'm done treating Lieutenant Abarai's wounds for today.
Thank you very much.
Abarai
Why did you attack the Ryoka alone?
Does it have anything to do with Rukia?
Owwee! You! You don't have to get so serious!
We can't afford to get hurt practicing, you know!
Stupid! Unless we're serious, practicing is useless.
You just didn't pay attention.
Then I'll be your opponent, next.
Kira!
It's no fun beating a girl, is it?
What are you saying, Kira?!
Are you making fun of women?
Oh, nonothing like that!
Quit acting so embarrassed!
Well, I wasn't thinking of you as an opponent,
but at least I won't be bored.
I'll make you eat your words.
You're good, Abarai!
So are you! You've improved, Kira!
Huh? Kira, just a minute.
Rukia!
Abarai!
Abarai
Lieutenant Hinamori! Special wartime orders were just announced.
Special wartime orders?
Special wartime orders! Special wartime orders!
Special wartime orders! Special wartime orders!
Hurry! Let's go!
First: All senior officers including Lieutenants
will be permitted to wear their swords at all times.
Second: They will be permitted to release their Zanpaku-to as in wartime.
Those are the orders from
Squad 1 Captain and Captain General of the 13 Court Guard Squads
Shigekuni Genryusai Yamamoto.
Understood.
Wartime orders. Permission to wear swords
Why did it come to this?
They don't have to let us carry Zanpaku-to. Peace is all that I want.
AndHitsugaya's warning I'm worried.
Be careful of Squad 3
Especially
Captain Aizen
What's the matter? Is something wrong, Hinamori?
I'm sorry
What is it at this hour? Dawn is about to break.
I know full well that this is very rude
but may I have a quick word?
I promise not to make any blunders.
So please
Do you think I would turn you away simply for rudeness?
N-No
Do I seem so heartless these days?
N-Nonot at all!
Then come inside. Today was a very difficult day.
Talk to your heart's content.
Owweee
Are you awake, Ichigo?
Damn that Ganju!
You remembered?
Naturally! That guy
laying his hand on an injured man!
But I'm glad Ganju was able to stop you earlier.
Otherwise, you would have started to bleed again.
I know I gotta cool my head, huh?
It's better if you lie down for a bit longer.
No one will come after you here. So rest assured.
I wonder what happened to him that Renji?
Huh? Oh I'm not really sure of the details
But he would normally be sent to emergency relief.
I see.
Yes.
What's the matter?
Didn't you have something to talk about?
Err, yes I
How is Abarai's condition?
Oh his life isn't in danger.
I'm glad.
Don't worry about the captains' meeting.
Captain Kuchiki asked that Abarai be discharged,
but there were objections and so he backed off.
Once his wounds heal,
he'll be able to return to his squad.
By chance, were you the one who objected, Captain Aizen?
Not only me. He's an excellent officer and liked by everyone.
There's not one person in the Thirteen Court Guard Squads
who would rejoice at his dismissal.
Yes!
Captain Aizen
Yes?
I won't disturb you So may I sit here and watch you?
Or is it an imposition?
No, I don't mind. Stay as long as you like.
Yes!
Darn!
I'm sorry! II fell asleep!
Huh?
Oh no! Look at the time!
Geez, I wish the Captain would've waken me up.
I wonder if I'll make it to the meeting on time?
I'll take a shortcut!
There, I think I made it
What was that scream?
It came from the Eastern Wall!
That was Hinamori's voice
Hinamori!
Hinamori! What's wrong? Hinamori!
Whaa-?! I-It can't be!
Captain Aizen!
Captain Aizen!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll always stay close to you
Now and forever
Thank you, Hanataro. I'm fully recovered.
It's about the only thing I can do.
As long as we have Hanataro, you're fine.
So Ichigo, go and get all cut up.
Absolutely not!
Go for it! Just go! No thanks!
Just get cut up!
