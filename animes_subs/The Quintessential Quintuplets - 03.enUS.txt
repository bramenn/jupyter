What the hell is this?
Work, damn sensors!
Shit, as if those sisters weren't bad enough,
now you're getting in my way, too?
Hey.
I'm tutoring for the Nakanos on Floor 30.
My name is Uesugi.
The door here
is broken.
Hey.
What are you doing out here by yourself?
Miku.
How haven't you heard of auto locks? They're everywhere nowadays.
You can punch in our apartment number on this keypad.
It'll call us.
O-Of course I knew that.
I messed up right off the bat.
Not off to a good start.
But...
What are you doing?
Huh?
O-Oh.
You're going to tutor us, aren't you?
The Quintessential Quintuplets
The Quintessential Quintuplets
The Quint es sen tial Quin tup lets
The Quintessential Quintuplets
So you had to come.
Hey.
Uh...
It should be around here somewhere.
The white one, right?
Sorry.
Why are you in bed past noon?
This is yours, Ichika?
S-So grown-up.
We have the same face.
You'd probably look good in it, too.
You should throw out the underwear you've had since elementary school.
U-Uesugi-san's here!
Shh!
So...
What do you think, Uesugi-san?
Do you think I'd...
I don't care. Just get changed.
I don't need your opinion, anyway! I bet you know nothing about fashion!
Okay, we're all set.
Let's start studying.
I think I'll watch.
Teach us Japanese history like you said you would.
I'm just going to be studying on my own here, so don't mind me.
There are plenty of problems,
but compared to the beginning, this is huge progress.
Hey! Wait!
They're human, too.
Be nice to them, and we can reach an understanding.
Okay, let's get started.
You're still here?
Still haven't given up on tutoring, huh?
I hope you don't fall asleep like you did last time.
That was because you drugged me.
Oh, shoot. Be nice.
Gotta be nice.
How about it?
Would you like to join us, Nino?
Over my dead body.
Guess I'll have to be content with four for now.
All right. Let's go without her for today.
Okay.
Oh yeah, Yotsuba,
my acquaintance on the basketball team is looking for someone to fill in for a game.
You're pretty athletic. Why don't you go right now?
R-Right now?
Um...
But...
Apparently, they only have five members, and one of them broke a bone.
They won't be able to play if they don't find someone.
I feel so bad for them.
You wouldn't, would you?
They must have practiced so hard.
Poor team.
Yotsuba?
I'm sorry, Uesugi-san.
I can't just abandon people in need!
You're kidding me.
That girl doesn't know how to say no.
Didn't you say you had work at two, Ichika?
Shoot, I forgot!
You too, Itsuki.
You should go to a quieter place, like the library or something.
That's a good idea.
All right! Gather'round, everyone!
Let's start studying.
Face reality, Futaro. Everyone's gone already.
Damn that Nino, always getting in my way...
What's she trying to pull?
Huh?
You're still here, Miku?
You owe me a drink from when you accidentally drank mine.
I already bought it.
Okay, let's start the lesson.
All right, let's switch gears.
Matcha Soda
Matcha Soda?
Hey, Miku!
Where do we start?
Why don't we start with the Kamakura period, then?
Since when have you two been so close?
So you have a thing for dull-looking guys, huh?
That was savage! Take it back!
You're too hung up on looks, Nino.
That was low-key savage, too!
What?
What's wrong with going for good-looking guys?
Are you telling me it's all about inner beauty?
What if I am?
I see.
It's because you don't care about appearances that you can go out dressed so shabbily.
And those pointy nails are supposed to be fashionable?
You wouldn't get it, would you?
I don't even want to.
C-Come on, you two.
You're sisters. Play nice.
Do we really need to argue over inner or outer beauty right now?
I guess not.
Just stop being a nuisance.
A nuisance?!
Guuurgle
Fine, then. Why don't we compete on inner beauty, as you say?
Let's have a cooking battle to see who's more homely.
Wh-Why?
If I win, no studying today.
Y-You're not going to accept, right?
I'll end this quickly. Just sit and wait, Futaro.
You sit down!
Why is absolutely nothing going my way?
Ta-da!
A dutch baby with seasonal veggies and ham.
Omurice
O-Omurice.
Well, it's up to you to judge which one's better.
Actually, never mind. I'll eat it myself.
You made it, so you might as well have him eat it.
Thank you.
Okay, yeah.
Both are pretty good.
It's true.
Not a Gourmet
Too Poor
They're both good.
What?!
No way.
What the heck?
Lame.
Jeez, that girl...
It's gotten so late.
We fell right into Nino's trap.
I'll have to try again another time.
Sorry.
But now it's all clear.
I don't know why, but Nino especially hates me.
I don't feel like I'll ever get to be on good terms with her.
You're wrong...
I think.
Huh?
Miku?
If you face her in good faith, she'll come around.
In good faith?
What am I supposed to do?
Don't ask me.
It's your job to figure that out.
Face her in good faith...
Good faith...
Shoot.
Uh...
What?
Sorry, I forgot my flash cards.
I'm taking a shower. Feel free to come in and grab them.
Wait, Miku, you're okay with that?
P-Pardon me.
M-Miku?!
You're already out of the shower?!
Come to think of it, she's not one to care about these things.
I'll just grab my cards and leave.
Who's there?
Miku?
I thought you were going to take a bath.
It's free now.
Nino!
My contacts are on the usual shelf. Could you get them for me?
Her eyesight is so bad that she can't see me?
Sh-Shit...
What should I do, then?
Good faith? If she finds out I'm here, there'll be no faith left!
No Faith
What do I do?
What?
Are you still mad about me messing with you at lunch?
Sh-Shit!
C-Contacts...
Where are they?
Here?
I just got carried away.
I feel bad about it, okay?
Damn it, where are they?
What are you doing? That's not where they are.
They're on the shelf above.
Huh?
I though they were on this shelf.
I can't face her now!
I can't take any more!
Run for it!
So you are mad.
It's his fault.
It's all his fault.
He keeps coming into our home just because Dad ordered it.
This home is for us five. There's no place for him here.
Is she...
That's it!
From now on, he's banned from our place!
Look out!
Above you!
At that point, I still didn't know...
Wh-Who's there?
Thank you.
You were great as always today, Ichika-chan.
See you next time.
Sure.
I didn't know how hard it would be to face these five idiots one at a time.
Thanks so much.
You're so good, Nakano-san. We're lucky to have you.
Let's kill it next time, too.
Hey, I want to ask you something...
Would you be up for officially joining the basketball team?
And I'd be taught a lesson, too.
It's because of what she said.
So you have a thing for dull-looking guys, huh?
It's not even true.
That I'm a complete idiot, too.
I-Intruder!
N-No!
I just came to take something.
Take what?
Nudes of me?
You pervert!
Molester!
Voyeur!
That's not what I meant!
You're the worst.
Order in the court.
Your Honor, please have a look at this.
The defendant, a tutor,
lost control of his urges in front of a young high school girl.
Defendant Uesugi... This is you in this photo, is it not?
I-It's a false charge.
Absent due to basketball team duties
Your Honor...
Yes, Plaintiff Nino-kun.
This guy pretended to leave the apartment
and waited for me to exit the shower.
H-Hey!
That's a fabrication!
For his heinous crimes, I request that he be barred permanently from entering here.
Th-That's too much!
I can't say I approve of your actions.
Ichika...
I just came to get something.
Y-Your Honor?
Objection.
Futaro may look like a criminal, but he's innocent.
What do you mean, I look like a criminal?
I let him in over the intercom.
There's a recording, too.
This was an unforeseen accident.
Miku!
You're still taking his side?
This guy said it himself!
That he's here to take something!
Take
To take sneak shots!
You mean he forgot something, and he came to get it.
Get
Your Honor, Miku is defending him due to her feelings for him.
N-No.
I knew you would believe in me, Miku.
Don't come any closer.
Huh?!
Are you acting like that because you're wary of him?
I'm not.
You're imagining things.
Just so you know, he saw me naked.
It's not like there's much to see.
Maybe not for you, but there is for me.
Our bodies are about the same.
N-Now's not the time to be arguing.
Shut up, Itsuki.
Also, delete that photo already.
Your Honor!
There, there.
Even if Miku were right, would you really end up in this position?
Ichika!
I knew you would understand.
This guy threw himself onto me out of nowhere.
No, I was...
Futaro, is that true?
Y-Yeah, but that was...
You're guilty.
Commit seppuku.
M-Miku-san?!
Shoot, I need to fight back.
I'm going to lose my tutoring job.
But can I get them to believe me?
The shelves...
Some books fell off the the shelves,
and he shielded Nino from them?
If you look carefully, you could see it that way.
Is that not it?
Th-That's exactly it!
Thanks, Itsuki.
I haven't done anything for you to thank me.
I'm just proposing a possible explanation.
True.
Yeah, there's no way Futaro-kun would have the balls.
H-Hey!
Why are you talking like it's been resolved now?
Quit talking out of your ass!
Stop it, Nino.
How dare you?
Come on, don't get so heated.
We sisters used to get along so well, remember?
That said, this happened because I was being careless.
Sorry.
We used to?
Hey, Nino?
She just left.
Shouldn't we get her?
Let her be.
I can finally go home and study.
Hey! Dinner's ready!
Uesugi Raiha Hello
Inbox
Get this, we're having your favorite: curry udon!
Are they really okay with things as they are?
Guess I shouldn't meddle too much in another family's issues.
God, you're so useless.
What?
She didn't bring her key,
but she can't bring herself to ask the three girls inside?
What are you looking at?
I don't want to see your face anymore.
I see.
Well, sorry.
She'd probably lash out if I helped her.
Go ahead and wait by yourself.
What are you doing?
There's a problem I just couldn't solve.
I don't feel like going home until I solve it.
I see.
All you ever care about is studying. So stupid.
Studying is stupid? That's a paradox.
Wait, I guess you could say I'm studying because I'm stupid.
Shut up.
Everyone's so stupid. I hate them all.
Everyone? Including your sisters?
You're lying.
I'm not.
They've got to be crazy to let a creepy guy like you inside.
Our home...
This home is for us five. There's no place for him here.
That's what you said.
Just shut up already.
It can't be just because you hate me.
You hate your sisters?
Are you sure it's not the opposite?
You love your four sisters, don't you?
That's why you don't like an outsider like me.
What?
You're so incredibly wrong.
You think you understand me.
That could never happen.
Creep.
What? What's wrong with that?
I just...
Nino, I know how you feel.
I have a sister.
Yeah.
I didn't do anything wrong, did I?
This is so stupid. Why should I have to beat myself up over this?
I've made up my mind.
I'm not going to accept you.
Even if that makes the other girls hate me.
Nino, how long are you going to sit here?
Hurry up and get back inside.
Miku?
You're here too, Futaro?
Perfect.
About tomorrow...
Let's head back, Miku.
But I still need to talk to him.
Forget it.
It looks like it's going to get even harder.
This is why I hate meddling too much.
Next Time on The Quintessential Quintuplets
Quintuplet Trivia!
Nino's in charge of the chores.
We're taking turns cooking from now on, though.
Okay!
How much water?
Eyeball it!
You're fired!
Five cups of rice each.
You're fired!
I ordered pizza!
You're fired!
I'm...
Fired!
