Episode
The blue moon illuminated
your wandering shadow.
I could never tell you all I wanted to say.
It was so very frustrating.
I think about your faked smile,
and forget all the hot tears we shed.
What do these empty husks,
those empty eyes of yours, reflect, my dear?
The transient quarter moon
hides in a rift in the clouds,
as darkness seeps up from the ground.
Tell me the truth, please.
Are you so despondent
that you still sit alone, sighing?
Without you, I just cant smile.
I walk this banal town,
feeling such intense emotions.
I know that if I could treasure them and live on,
I would need nothing else.
The summer flowers that bloomed in the sky
Come falling down, dancing in the wind.
I can barely recall the night sky
where they all came tumbling down,
so what I can still recall is all the more precious.
Part the Second
The End
The intertwined fates of men give the Mononoke its Form.
Enter the woman, protecting her child.
Enter the mistress who gives the woman shelter for the night.
Enter the man who seeks the woman.
They all reside beneath the same roof.
A splendid cast, set against the nightly bustle, the splash of drink and the clatter of cups,
and the innocent sound of childrens voices.
Though the voices were clear, the children were absent, except for the one in the womans womb.
The Mononoke is most certainly a Zashikiwarashi,
but where are the Truth and Regret?
There is something within this lodge.
The pregnant girl and this inn
Im sorry.
Ill protect you.
Does this perhaps bring
Im sorry!
anything to mind?
There, there.
What of the man the Mononoke killed?
Do you know him?
The mans name was Naosuke.
He was an assassin.
Why was he here?
To kill me and my unborn child.
ShShe was serious about that?
ShShe was serious about that?
Who sent him?
My master and mistress.
Why?
Because its father is their heir.
It was an unallowable
Relationship.
But they did allow it!
Good lord.
They just suddenly said it couldnt be, that it was forbidden!
Idiot.
Stupid girl.
Stupid girl.
I didnt want their property!
So naive.
I promised the young master!
I just wanted to give birth!
Thats all!
God, youre so annoying!
I dont care if its a Mononoke or a ghost, or what, I
If theres something in this house,
then why dont we just leave?
How the
What
Huh?
My goodness.
What on Earth is going on?
Mother.
It stinks.
People?
Im sorry!
What is
this?
Just where is this?
This will be difficult.
How can you be so relaxed?
Do something about this!
Its gone?
This way.
Its coming.
Its gone again.
Youre the one who refuses to talk, maam.
Now
This room was made as an offering to the dead.
What do you mean, an offering?
It was all I could do for them.
All you could do?
This house was once a brothel.
Where is this, maam?
This is the abortion room.
Its a grave for all the children produced.
We were doing them a favor.
Whats wrong with that?
What?
Huh?
Shino?
Shino, I love you.
The young master,
and myself?
Shino, I love you.
I love you.
I am your servant.
I love you.
The master and mistress will not allow it.
I love you.
Let us marry!
Marry?
Are you sure?
I dont care what happens.
Really?
Really. Youre all I need.
Oh, really?
Then I can tell you.
What is it?
What can you tell me?
I am carrying your child.
Huh?
Is that so?
Youll sleep with anyone who has money, right?
What a stupid girl.
Right, Tokuji?
Yup.
Mother.
Mother.
Mother.
How nice!
Ive decided.
Ill use these people.
Congratulations!
Thank you.
Ive finally got a mother.
Goodness, what a nuisance!
She seems so nice.
If you cant work, youll never pay off your debt.
Its no good hiding.
Youre useless.
If you cant work, you dont eat. Youre whores, sold to pay a debt!
You cant do your job with a child in the works.
Stop it.
In order to survive
Stop it!
I had no choice.
Youre with child, are you?
Thats
no good.
Well help you out.
If its gone
The Zashikiwarashi wont come after you!
Stop it!
The Zashikiwarashi wanted to be born!
Thats why they came after you.
Stop it!
Dont kill him!
No.
Medicine Seller?
Those tied to this room were killed when this was a brothel.
Those tied to this room were killed when this was a brothel.
A childs emotions.
Now for the Regret. Just one more.
If I find the Regret, the sword can be drawn.
What is it you want?
Stop it!
Dont kill them!
What did those poor children do to you?
This is a Mononoke. It wishes to burst forth from your belly.
It just wants to live in this world!
But it cannot.
Come here.
Ill give birth to you, as well.
You wish to give birth to the Mononoke?
All those within my womb are my children.
Stop it.
Youll be sucked in.
I will give birth to my child.
Thats all I want.
Why?
Congratulations!
I like this one!
She always strokes me.
So kind.
So kind.
So kind.
So kind.
So kind.
So kind.
So kind.
So kind.
Im glad it was her.
Im sorry I had to hurt you so.
Thank you for always trying your best.
Thank you for talking to me so much.
I love you.
I love you.
I love
you.
Thank you for choosing me, for coming to me.
Im sorry. I could not be your mother.
We cant be together.
There, there. There, there.
Well, I never did eat, did I?
Are you sure I should be your mother?
I hope to see you soon.
