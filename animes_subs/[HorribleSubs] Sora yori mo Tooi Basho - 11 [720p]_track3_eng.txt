No! I don't want to die!
Shut up!
Let go! This is why I didn't want to come here!
Kimari-san...
Shut up! If you want her to live, fork over the cash!
Help me! I have a turtle and a hamster who need me!
I'm sorry, I'm just a temp. You'll want to talk to the banking manager...
This is no time to be playing around.
You're still laughing?!
She's right. It's not nice to keep laughing at her...
Yuzuki-chan. That's the kind of thing that hurts most...
Can you hear me?
There it is!
Kimari!
Rin! Mom!
What happened to your face?
We've gotta take a picture!
That's the first thing you have to say after all this time?
Sis, are you gonna do your New Year's Eve broadcast looking like that?
My stomach hurts!
We're working on it...
Next. Miyake-san?
Yes?
Some friends of yours heard about this relay test and came to talk to you.
Friends?
Of mine?
Miyake-san, it's been so long!
We haven't heard from you for so long, so we were worried.
What is it?
Did it go down?
Hinata?
Ouchies! My leg's cramped!
Shirase, sorry, you take over!
Hey! Hinata!

It's here.
That's all the extra stuff we needed
brought by DROMLAN from Japan on its way to the new station.
Which means we have everything we need now.
Of course, we won't be able to create an observatory
that can see the stars this year right away.
But a few years from now, if we try for it...
We should go, shouldn't we?
I think that's what everyone wants, at least.
Still... that's the place where Takako died.
It's not safe at all.
What should we do?
New Year's
From Syowa Station
This is awful!
I bet Mom's spreading it all over social media right now!
What's the big deal? It makes better advertising for the broadcast.
Hinata?
Oh... do mine, too!
Oh? Your only New Year's card is to your manager?
None for your friends from earlier?
Well... they're New Year's cards,
but they won't reach anyone until the boat gets back to Japan anyway.
I'm gonna hit the can!
Ouch!
Stupid thing...
Is she annoyed?
Did it hurt that much?
She seems a bit stressed out.
Shirase-chan, you're going, too?
Piss off!
Piss off!
Piss off, damn it!
Stupid thing!
Piss off!
There you are!
The weather's cleared up,
so they said they'd bring us along for the sea ice and geological testing!
I'll prepare the camera, so think about your report!
Huh? Oh. Right.
Expedition! Expedition!
Don't forget, you said you'd do the report!
Don't claim later that you don't want to do it!
Um... Hinata...
About before...
That was a test, so it won't cut the mustard.
No
Hurry up! They're heading out soon!
Coming!
We did this together three years ago.
Takako-senpai just wanted to do everything.
She did?
Yeah, she went all over.
She was here, too, Shirase-chan!
Isn't that nice?
Yeah...
Take that!
What's that?
It's all ice up ahead, so we're digging a hole with steam.
After that, I think we went to RundvAgshetta.
Sounds like a powerful name!
It's a place with exposed rock.
If you ask Nobue-san, she might take you there.
Let's go!
Sea Ice here! Nobue-san at geology? Do you read? Over!
Haven't heard from him since Christmas.
The garnet he gave me two years ago...
Dry rocks and dry love...
No email. No nothing from Yu-kun.
She's currently unable to talk. Over.
It's cold!
Seriously. The difference in air temperature is extreme...
Please, stop it!
Look! It's amazing!
So cold!
Watch for animals
Antarctica really is amazing, huh?
It's neat to see it from this angle...
The sky is flowing by!
I wonder if we'll see an aurora?
At night, maybe.
But it won't become night
during the time we're here.
Hinata.
Is something bothering you?
Bothering me?
Well, my lips get so chapped with the dry air,
but my lip balm is frozen, so it's hard to put on.
I know how you feel!
It really is hard! It's like your skin is peeling off.
Right?
So dry!
Be Careful Going Outside
All crew outdoors, please seek shelter in the main building
or a building with emergency rations.
It's not getting better at all.
You should probably give up on it.
Where'd Shirase go, anyway?
Someone asked her earlier if she knew how to play Mahjong...
For real? Can she?
It sounded fun, so I looked over her shoulder, but...
Hey, how do you read the one that looks like a person next to a five?
Go.
Hey, you've got some white ones mixed up in your reserves.
They're not reserves.
That bird is so cute!
Get out!
That's rather cruel.
Right? I was only asking questions!
Shirase's always been testy!

No kidding!
Ron.
Menhon, Double South, Three Dora nets me 16,000 points.
Are you for real?
Hey, have you been playing with Takako since you were little?
Yes, once in a while...
Let's quit. We can't win.
Jantei
Not against the daughter of Gin and Takako...
Is Miyake-san here?
She's probably in the bath.
What's up?
We got an email from her friends addressed to the base.
Friends?

National Antarctic Research Center (To Miyake Hinata) Hanyu Daisan High School Track Team National Antarctic Research Center Re: About the broadcast timetable
you quit the track team and quit school so suddenly
We wish we'd said something to the older girls. We're sorry for leaving you all alone.
Shirase?
Are you...
Hinata-chan?
National Antarctic Research Center (To Miyake Hinata)
You saw it?
Just a little.
But that was addressed to Hinata-san...
How could you do something like that?
But... but I was worried, so...
You seemed so mad about something, and...
you wouldn't say anything...
You were mad?
What, you saw it?
You should have said something!
I was worried.
I thought you were hiding something!
Something you weren't telling us!
We're sorry for leaving you all alone.
Let me tell you in advance, it's a totally gross story.
I don't want to talk about it, and I hate that you asked me.
Just tell us.
In short, it's about why I stopped going to club.
It's the competition, so the fastest people should go.
Your year and stuff doesn't matter!
But for the third-years, this will be their last competition...
Exactly! It would be more rude to go easy on them!
Two hundred meter, Miyake Hinata.
Yes!
Didn't you say something to that idiot?
O-Of course... we told her to be more sensitive...
In that instant, nothing mattered to me.
But it does matter! They're the ones to blame.
Humans can be scary, huh?
After I quit, they kept spreading all kinds of rumors to lay the blame on me.
Is that why you quit school?
Hinata.
Sorry I'm a loser!
Then the ones who sent the email are...
Yeah. My old teammates.
They want to talk during the broadcast.
They said they were proud their friend went to Antarctica.
Though mainly, I was thinking Oh, were we friends?
Well?
What? Different from what you imagined?
It's almost otherworldly, huh?
Oh, uh, yeah!
What an unusual color!
We'll set up a tent and antenna down that way.
Okay!
Hey!
How long are you gonna drag this out? Forget it.
I don't like being treated this way.
But...
Look, why do you think I came to Antarctica?
Because there's nothing here!
I wanted to go to an empty place with no one to tie me down!
Look, isn't it amazing?
Glaciers! Strata! Water from melted snow!
Colors and shapes I've never seen before!
We're in a place isolated from everything we know,
a completely different world from where we've been before.
That's what I came here to enjoy!
But it doesn't mean anything if you're all sad, right?
Got it. Then we'll forget it!
First, we've got camping to do!
It's not a game!
Shirase?
It does mean something.
It absolutely does mean something!
It's like a sci-fi movie, isn't it?
Want to drink the water? It's delicious.
We can drink it?
In a way, it's the cleanest water on the planet.
Hardly anyone's ever touched it,
and it doesn't get warm enough to breed bacteria.
I'm first!
No fair!
How is it?
Delicious!
I want to try, too!
You're right! It's delicious and cold!
It really hits the spot!
Want some, Shirase-chan?
Later.
We got through.
Talk.
Me?
U-Um... this is Kobuchizawa at RundvAgshetta.
Over.
This is Syowa. We read you loud and clear.
How is the scenery? Over.
Um... It's like we're surrounded by cake.
Cake?
Takako said the same thing.
The minute we got there, I want to eat chocolate cake!
My mother said that?
It's the best natural water I've ever had!
Like this?
Perfect.
Kimari-san, you're good at the strangest things.
That's not strange, is it?
Can they see this on the satellites?
Yes. We use these so they can check our location on the satellites.
It will definitely show up.
It's not taking it now.
Yu-kun...
Yu-kun!
Um...
Don't let it bother you. She does this constantly.
We even put a plate here. Someone's watching, huh?
It's nothing personal, okay?
What bliss!
Especially since it's getting colder.
And now it's time for...
Ta-da!
Next time we get hot water going, let's make tamagoyaki!
You really like tamagoyaki, huh?
She did eat a lot of it for breakfast in Singapore!
Hinata.
I'm going to collect water. Come with me.
We don't have enough? Sorry I used it all earlier...
Kimari-san.
Wow, it's freezing when the wind blows.
I could just die right now!
I've been thinking about what I'd do in your position.
We're sorry for leaving you all alone.
If someone had treated me so awfully,
then called me up out of the blue, as though nothing happened,
wanting to apologize for the permanent damage they'd done...
Hey, look...
I couldn't be okay with it.
I couldn't smile.
You're not me, though.
I know, but...
I know, but...
Shirase.
Take off your gloves.
Hand them over.
Your hands are enough.
Shirase, you're so annoying, the way you keep talking and talking.
Thanks.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm still scared.
Hinata...
I'm scared.
But we...
I said your hands were enough, remember?
Thanks for bringing me along.
Tamagoyaki's ready!
Okay! We're on our way!
C'mon!
12/31 Choose Your Own New Year's Soba Tempura Mochi Plain
You suck! They're not supposed to be flat noodles!
They're thin enough!
Start from scratch.
Really?!
Ready to roll in ten minutes.
Understood!
My sun tan never recovered...
It's proof that you're enjoying Antarctica.
Hey.
Do you think I'll feel better if I forgive them?
You want to forgive them?
If it would make me feel better, I might.
But when I imagine them looking all relieved afterwords, it gets under my skin.
Piss off?
Yeah.
I'm a pretty petty person, aren't I?
It's 9:00 AM here.
A six-hour difference from Japan...
Before we start, may I say one thing?
Shirase-chan?
I beg your pardon, but could you leave Miyake Hinata alone?
Shirase...
You might think Hinata has been holding a grudge against you since she quit school,
that she's been suffering badly.
Maybe you think she spends every day crying,
thinking about what happened to her.
But...
But...
But that's not true!
Hinata-chan is having a super, amazing fun time with us!
She's having a really fulfilling trip of the sort you can't get where you are!
Hey!
Hinata is already looking forward!
She's already walking!
She's taking her steps with us!
Shirase!
It's fine! It's friendship!
Unlike Hinata, I'm a real jerk, so I'll say it outright.
You can't live your lives in this halfway state forever!
You hurt someone and made them suffer!
Now you get to live with that!
That's what you get for hurting someone!
That's what you get for hurting my friend!
Shirase!
You think you can come crawling back now?
Piss off!
Let's get things ready.
Okay.
The year is nearing its end.
Will it be on TV?
Last year's video, yeah.
It's here!
Yu-kun! Yu-kun! Yu-kun!
Let's do it, too!
Casting away our worldly desires!
You mean...
Let's bash the bad thoughts away, Hinata-chan!
What if we break it?
So what if you do? It's just a drum can.
Good point!
Okay, let's do the first one together!
One, two...
