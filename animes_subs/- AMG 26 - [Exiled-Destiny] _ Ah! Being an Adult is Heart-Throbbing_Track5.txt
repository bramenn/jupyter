Open your mind. Open your mind.
Far beyond the deep blue Earth, you and I shall meet...
AH! MY GODDESS
AH! MY GODDESS
A snow-white feather will come fluttering down, swaying gently in the air.
Without holding back, I want to envelope you, my one and only love.
I know I have the power to protect the one I love, right here in my hands.
Open your mind. Just as I've always dreamed.
Let the wind carry off your hopes, faraway.
I have wings nobody can see. Look, you have them, too.
They'll take us to where we can be free. Anyone can be free.
The sky is so blue...
Skuld Laboratory S...s...
Sticking out!
Sculpted!
Sticking out!
All right!
I'm an adult now!
What's all this yelling so early in the morning...whoa!
What are you staring at?
Um...
And who would you be?
Ah! Is My Heart Pounding Because I'm a Grownup?
Oh, man. Look how carried away she is...
Is this another one of those Yggdrasil side-effects?
Most likely.
But why did she turn into an adult?
Oh, that's easy. The three of us control different time domains.
I govern the past...
Belldandy, the present...
And Skuld, the future.
So if there's a shortfall in our energy supply from Heaven...
I see.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Look at me, look at me!
Well? Am I sexy?
My, don't you look lovely!
You do.
You need to stick out and be tight where you're supposed to.
That is'sexy'!
Take a good look! See how big they...
Whose? And what? Are big?
Just give me a little time, and they'll be bigger than yours for sure!
Little idiot, give you a little more time, and you'll be middle-aged.
What's that supposed to mean?
Think about it! You're going to keep growing at this pace.
If we don't do anything about it...
No way!
And that means that 2 weeks from now, she'll be...
No way! Tell me you're joking!
When that happens, I'll call you'Big Sister'!
I'd rather die than let that happen!
You don't have to worry, Skuld.
Big Sister?
Uh-oh.
I asked Heaven about it just now, and they told me...
You'll be able to go back to the way you were before!
Oh, great.
Thank goodness!
I did tell Urd about that, you know...
Wait, but that means...
I can only be a grownup until tonight?
I suppose so.
Is that right?
Thank goodness, right?
That's right...there's no time to lose, then.
Keiichi, help me out, will you?
Huh? Uh, sure.
All right, you're set.
Now let me just slip on this ring, and...
Listen...did you really want to become a grownup that badly?
What do you think?
No matter what, people have always treated me like a child.
Really?
Whenever we go shopping, it's always either Big Sister or Urd...
And even if I'm walking with you, people only think we're brother and sister.
Everyone at college, too! They all treat me like a kid, giving me ice cream.
When I'm just as much a lady as anyone else!
Hey, look! Look at all the ice cream I got!
That's because you always lap it up so eagerly.
Anyway! Now that I'm all grown up...
I've got to enjoy what it feels like, at least just for this one day.
Where are you going?
I'm going out, what did you think?
So I'll see you later, all right? Oh...
What's the matter?
I'm so hungry...
Urd drinks sake... Belldandy goes to sleep...
Skuld recharges by eating ice cream, huh?
That's right. Each goddess has her own alternate source of energy.
Ah! Now I'm revitalized!
Okay, let's go!
You should just go home and stay out of trouble.
I'll be fine!
Hey, that girl over there... don't you think she's really hot?
She's with her boyfriend... that's one lucky dog.
Wait a minute...those guys think I'm your girlfriend?
Uh, yeah.
For real? Then that means they see me as a grownup! Right?
Uh, probably.
Grownup...I love the way that sounds!
Now then, shall we be off, Keiichi dear? Come on...
Hey! Hold on!
Belldandy's...
Uh, that's right.
Well, now that you mention it, I think I see the resemblance...
To Big Sister?
Big Sister?
Cool! I've always wanted someone to tell me that!
You're a wonderful person!
But you're linking arms...
You'd better not have been two-timing Belldandy behind her back!
Of course not!
Oh, don't tell me you suspect that Keiichi and I might be lovers?
Suspect? You two couldn't be anything but lovers!
So we do look like we're going out!
This is no time to be overjoyed, you know.
Oh! Look at this!
Hey! That's my bike!
I've always wanted to take it for a spin.
Urd's always going,'Not for children!' and totally dissing me...
But at this moment, I'm a grownup!
I have to tell you, being an adult rocks! See ya later!
That was my bike...
Hey! Skuld! Come back here!
Huh? Skuld?
Aha...now there's a fine specimen...
Pardon me...
Me?
Yes, would you care to join me for some afternoon tea?
Afternoon tea?
Ah! Isn't that what you call a pickup line?
I just read about that in a book, so I know it!
Uh, actually...
It's just that I can't stop myself from approaching...
Oh...
Listen, I have a favor to ask of you.
There's no need to be bashful.
Feel free to partake of all the ice cream they have on hand!
Do you mean that? Of course.
Excuse me!
She really did clean them out!
Energy fully recharged!
You're going to reciprocate in full.
Now, then. Come this way.
Hey... Now, then. Come this way.
Excuse me...
Wait...
How can this be?
Keiichi's hands were warm, but this man's hands are cold.
What's the matter?
No.
What?
I don't want to... even though I'm not sure why...
You've come this far, you wanted to...
Don't touch me! You've come this far,you wanted to...
What are you talking about?
Surely you didn't think you could just eat and run, did you?
No!
Stay away from me!
Come back here!
No...
No...no...
No!
Looks like you've hit a dead end.
Stay away from me!
Now then, shall we go?
No...
Help me!
Big Sister!
Keiichi!
Skuld!
Keiichi!
Morisato?
Ouch...take it easy, will you?
Never mind, just take off!
Right.
Come back here!
You again?
I guess you really enjoy being punished!
Just hold on!
It's so strange...
I couldn't stand that other man touching me...
Keiichi...
Hey, what's gotten into you all of a sudden?
I was right...
About what?
I'm fine with Keiichi.
Actually...my heart seems to be pounding.
Keiichi!
What's up?
You see...
I just want...
I want to go out just a while longer.
With you.
With me?
Please!
Well, you said you wanted to go out, so here we are downtown...
Anywhere's fine, really...
You decide for us!
But the thing is, I wouldn't know where to go...
That's fine!
But we can go to those places anytime.
We should go wherever your present self wants to go today.
Let me think...Got it!
Are you sure you shouldn't have gone with them?
Oh, yes. I have to prepare dinner as soon as Yggdrasil gets restored.
That's not what I meant...
Aren't you worried that Skuld might take Keiichi away?
You saw it, didn't you?
The way she looks at Keiichi, it's so obvious she's head over heels!
Head over heels?
Man, you're so thick. I mean she loves Keiichi.
Yes! Both Skuld and I love Keiichi very, very much!
What's wrong?
Oh...never mind. More tea, please.
I guess this just shows how stable your relationship is.
So I apply some of this...
Um...Miss?
If I may offer an opinion, I think you should go for a more natural look.
Do you, really?
What do you think, Keiichi?
Come on, let's move on to the next place!
Are high heels really this tight and uncomfortable?
Well, I've never worn them, so I wouldn't know.
Whoops-a-daisy...
Keiichi...
Are you okay?
Sure, I'm fine!
I'm an adult, after all. Shoes like these don't faze me. Let's go.
Hup, two, three, four.
Sir?
Huh?
That will be 39,800 yen with tax.
Huh?! Wait, come back here, Skuld!
For crying out loud! Why are grownup clothes so complicated?
This goes on the outside, so this cord should go through here...
So...I'm an adult...
Skuld?
How's it going?
Do you want me to get someone to help you?
I can do it myself.
I think...I can do it.
I'm ready!
I don't know... I feel a little strange...
Well? Do you feel like you're a lady now?
Yeah...
Excuse me...
Would you happen to have some spare time after you're through here?
You see...
Sayoko?
You're asking me to fill in for that girl as a model?
Yes, she was suddenly stricken by a stomachache.
Is there any way you could do me this favor?
Modeling, though...
No, no! Modeling, though...
I can tell just by looking at you two that you fit our bridal salon's image of...
It's a wonderful way to commemorate your love for each other, so please!
Couple?
Love for each other?
Oh...am I mistaken?
Well, actually...
What should we do?
Well, I don't mind...
I'm indebted to you!
Oh, uh...well...
All right, I'm going to start shooting.
This is really getting weird...
Why is my heart pounding so hard? Over Keiichi, of all people!
I can't take this anymore! Somebody please stop my heart from pounding!
All right, next I want to get some shots of you kissing.
Kissing?
You won't do that for me? Well, could you just pretend, then?
Oh...
A k-k-kiss? With Keiichi?
Oh boy...what am I supposed to do?
Skuld?
Huh? What? What is it?
We're just going to pretend to do it, so could you look over here?
Uh, sure. Sure!
Yikes...why is it so hard to breathe all of a sudden?
Skuld...
Huh...
Keiichi...
Close your eyes, will you?
Okay.
I get it. I must have...
No, I definitely have feelings for...
Okay, that's fine.
Hey, good job, Skuld.
Let's go change.
Ah...
Right...
So the entire system's been restored?
I see...got that.
Good job!
So you're awake now!
Yes, I'm fine now.
They just called to let us know that Yggdrasil's been restored.
If Belldandy's up, then I guess right about now...
Oh...it's evening already.
How did you like being a grownup?
Well, I enjoyed some things about it...
Listen...
Do you remember that time when you, Big Sister, and I all went for a walk?
Huh?
I remember you were so absorbed in your conversation with Big Sister...
If I were all grown up, would you listen to me like that?
Skuld...
But I was wrong.
Even though I'm all grown up, you still just treat me like you always do.
Uh, do I really?
Yes, you do!
You never once talked to me the way you talk to Big Sister.
Listen, Keiichi...
Huh?
Do you have feelings for Big Sister?
Yes, I do.
Then...my present self... what about my present self?
My present...
My present...
My present self?
Myself...
But...
Never mind.
Okay.
Hey, it's gotten a lot chillier. We should get going...
Hey, Keiichi, turn to your left and close your eyes.
What's this all of a sudden?
Just do it!
Fine.
Just don't play any weird tricks on me, okay?
Thank you...
Keiichi...
Whoa...
Looks like I've turned back!
Hey, come with me.
Augh!
Look here, Keiichi... what do you think you're doing?
Hey...the only one who can ride up here is the present you.
Isn't that a good thing?
That's not the point! Isn't that a good thing?
You're so thick, you know that, Keiichi?
And besides, we can't drive on public roads like this!
You're right.
You just don't get anything, do you?
Hey, sorry!
Hey, Belldandy! Is it all right for you to be up already?
Oh, yes.
Oh...where's Skuld?
She went to her room to change her clothes.
Next time, I want to become a real adult.
I knew it...I guess I have no choice.
I hate to do this to Keiichi, but...
Augh! Whoa!
Big Sister, what's going...
Skuld! Look, this isn't what it...
My, my! You just got home and you can't hold back your passion, can you?
Really! Keiichi pushed Belldandy down to the floor against her will, and look...
No, that's not true! It was Urd who...
KEIICHI!
You're a jerk after all, Keiichi!
You get away from my big sister right now! I hate you after all, Keiichi!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams.You have a Wing!
Always believe in yourself and your Dreams.You have a Wing!
I love you so much it hurts...
And it hurts me that I can't tell you how I feel.
You and I have matching hearts...
So we must share the same scars deep down inside.
But now that I'm in your arms, I think I can catch...
Nobody else matters... All we have to do is gaze at each other.
It's all right for your heart to flutter... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
Don't run away from happiness.
I'll always be waiting for you.
So come rest your wings anytime.
It's all right to cry... anytime you need to.
I just want to see you again... All we have to do is love each other.
Open your heart, and ride that favorable wind.
I just want you to be happy.
