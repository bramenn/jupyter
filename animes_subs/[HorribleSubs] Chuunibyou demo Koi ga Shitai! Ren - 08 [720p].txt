I can see it. The reconstruction of this world is already underway.
Wha?
A dark being utilized the opportunity to infiltrate...
This place is an utterly different world!
Either way, it's the same.
No. It feels alien.
Has the dark world already eroded so far into this world?
I know what I must do.
Schwartz Shield!
How was your field trip?
It had its ups and downs.
Wasn't it fun?
You two wandered around the city together, right?
Hey, you got a new one!
The Schwartz Z/X Perfect Customized Ghelzonianses!
Don't mix that in!
Ghelzoni?
Good morning!
Oh, if it isn't Ghelzonianses and my master!
I said, don't mix that in.
Dekomori.
Why are you acting so surprised, Master?
The dimension really has warped!
EPISODE VIII THE FALSE... MORI SUMMER
The real Mori Summer?!
Ssh, not so loud.
What do you mean?
There is no real thing. I'm right here.
But she told me she met her.
I think they became acquainted through her home page
while you were away on your field trip.
She's here.
H-how do you do?
I have been expecting you, Mistress Mori Summer.
How do you do?
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Sanja.
Did she say Sanja?
But look at the gemstones on her left hand.
Those are the Mori Summer trademark.
I, the Magician Mori Summer, have come here once again
to deliver my words of guidance unto you.
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
I will begin with a purification I and the soul spirits will perform.
Please place your hands together and close your eyes peacefully.
Yes.
I am done.
What the heck was that?
I suspect that was a magical purification device.
What?!
That was obviously a digital camera.
Who does that woman think she is anyway?
And so, you informed them of my existence upon their return?
Yes, ma'am. I intend to inform Fake Mori Summer
of your existence as well, Mistress Mori Summer.
Then she'll be sorry!
Sanja, you mustn't approach others with such evilness in your heart.
Yes, any commoner who would assume the name of Mori Summer
is undoubtedly a thoroughly twisted individual with an ugly heart.
What?!
However, if you entertain hatred for such a person...
that hate will only taint your own purity, Sanja.
Love is most important!
A foolish, worthless commoner who thrives upon deceit...
is precisely who so desperately needs our guidance!
Oh!
Oh, really? That woman is very interesting.
Hey!
It's you, Fake Sum...
I told you I'm not a fake.
Oh, dear. Are you the one who has been using my name?
Deko!
You're the identity thief! How dare you make a home page?!
Oh, my. Sanja told me about you,
but I had no idea the pretense ran so deep.
You must be extremely impure of heart.
It's easy to see.
Oh, really?
Mistress Mori Summer!
You stand back!
Deko! You stand back!
Sanja!
Who are you calling Sanja?! Now listen up!
I utterly despise women like you who hide who they really are...
Like you can talk.
You butt out.
Then are you suggesting that you are the real Mori Summer?
I am!
If so, why do you hide who you really are?
I have been told that you attempted to burn the scripture of the Mabinogion.
Th-that was because...
That's right! You would only do that because you are the imposter!
That isn't true!
Then why did you?
Because...
Well...
It's complicated.
Just be quiet.
Was it wise to tell her you'd bring the proof tomorrow?
I couldn't exactly back down.
I disposed of my dark history very thoroughly.
There is nothing left.
The hand accessory isn't enough proof.
Now what?
It's time for my last resort.
Spirits, I order you. Please honor my request.
That's your last resort?!
I feel the power.
It will be fine. This locating method has a 100 success rate.
As they say, fortune telling can be unpredictable.
Be quiet. You're distracting me.
So, she found nothing.
Is Nibutani really the imposter
as Dekomori claims?
No, not at all.
But I don't really see the issue no matter who's the real thing.
Yuta.
Yeah.
So, you have no proof then?
You could say that. But I am the real one.
This is what you get for competing with the real thing, Fake Summer!
You don't know the sheer scope of your folly!
Oh, be quiet! I will also add that I'll bet you don't have any proof either.
You are truly appalling. The proof that I am indeed Mori Summer...
Pardon?
I am the very visage of the magician embodied within the Mabinogion.
My true identity is obvious to one with magical power such as Sanja.
That's right!
I knew it was her the moment I saw her!
I knew this was truly the real Mori Summer!
Do you recall how you claimed that I was the real thing too?
Don't act so conceited!
That was an advanced tactic designed to throw you off guard!
So that's what it was!
Don't fall for that.
I will be blunt.
We are all now fully aware that you are am imposter.
No one with such a disgraceful countenance could possibly be Mori Summer.
Now, repent the error of your ways and part with Sanja.
That shut you up good. I knew you were the imposter.
Fine.
Huh?
So what if my old, dark history was dragged out into the light?
I just have to ignore it, and it will go away.
I no longer have any proof that I'm Mori Summer.
I'm relieved to finally be free of you.
So long.
Mori Summer?
Hey, Nibutani.
F-Fake Summer?
Now she and I are both finally free to take our proper paths uninhibited.
Mistress Mori Summer.
I'm relieved to finally be free of you.
As if! I know you hate to lose.
Sanae, what's wrong?
You don't look very happy today.
I'm fine.
You're sure?
SENDER: MISTRESS MORI SUMMER TO: DEKOMORI
Come to my house after school and we will read the Mabinogion together.
Are you really okay with this?
It has nothing to do with me.
Of course it does. She's impersonating you!
Whatever. I just won't let it bother me.
Ow.
Dekomori.
Yesterday was a true work of blunder!
Your fakeness was finally exposed for what it really is...
W-wait!
Why?
Why do you sulk? Did it hurt so much to be beaten by me?
To be exposed for the imposter you really are?
Not really.
Go on, class is starting.
Well, hmph! This is what I get for exercising tact.
Are you sure?
About what?
And then Deko went home?
Yes.
That's no good. That's where you have to shine.
You are Ghelzonianses, aren't you?
Please don't memorize that, Senpai!
I did ask them both to come to the club room.
Dekomori is useless to me now. I must find a temporary servant.
And then there's you!
Do you really think Deko will be okay?
Whoever that person is, she scares me.
Why is that?
Listen.
Love?
Yeah. According to Kumin-senpai...
Don't be ridiculous.
I actually thought the same thing.
When I look back at it...
You really should tell her.
W-why? Assuming that's true,
if that's what that idiot truly wants, then leave it that way.
Hey, what's the point of being stubborn about it?
Dekomori is only into her because she believes she's Mori Summer.
That is exactly what ticks me off.
How could she be taken in by that imposter so easily?
But is she really?
What?
I think Deko is only doing it because somewhere deep down...
She's too stupid to think something that complex.
What is it?
Ssh.
What is she doing?
I bet that's a photo of Deko!
Battle?
Yeah. You will challenge her to battle in front of Dekomori.
Defeat her, and prove that you are Mori Summer.
That is the best way to do it now there's no more proof
that you are the real Mori Summer.
Excuse me?!
You've done it before, remember?
You must fully become Mori Summer and fight her.
That's how I earned Rikka's trust!
Infatuated much?
No!
Even I get embarrassed! But there's no time to think.
He's right. You can't let her take Deko away from you.
W-why should I care?
Argh, this is too much trouble!
Go, Rikka!
Understood.
W-what?
You need a crash course!
I will engrave you with the power of Wicked Lord Shingan!
Be destroyed, real. Blow up, synapses.
Vanishment, This World!
Huh?
What's wrong?!
Vanishment, This World!
I think I'm incompatible with this shrine.
Incompatible? Get real!
Now what do we do?
Rikka can't do it, and Deko isn't around to help either.
Togashi?
I'm through with all that.
We need the magical devil girl.
Who, Shichimiya? But you...
The magical devil girl told me.
She said would remain a magical devil girl forever.
And the contract between you and I is absolute.
It will work.
I summon thee!
I am magical devil girl, Sophia Ring SP Saturn VII!
I will smite the angel!
Sorry for calling you out so late.
That's okay. You guys helped me out on my school field trip.
I'm really glad things seem to be working out for you two.
Huh?
So, you want me to give Mori Summer a crash course in combat?
What? You're serious?
Yes, please.
Leave it to me. I was her partner...
Do you see the medicinal plants over there?
You always picked and ate them.
What? S-stop!
You would put a notch in a tree and drink its sap.
Stop!
And you would spend entire days trying to talk with small birds.
Embarrassing! Embarrassing! Embarrassing! Embarrassing!
Discard all shame!
You are Mori Summer, the magician who has lived for 1,200 years!
You are here to spread your message of love!
No!
Is she okay?
We have to. Do it.
Okay, here it comes!
No!
I knew she was genuinely an imposter.
Although I knew that all along.
MAILBOX Now delete that web page or I won't get you a souvenir.
Now delete that web page or I won't get you a souvenir.
And what is that?
Mistress Mori Summer!
Y-you startled me.
It seems as though your heart is still tainted.
What? Mistress Mori Summer?
I will purify it for you.
I will embrace your entirety with my love.
Mistress Mori Summer, you're standing too close.
Let me take care of it.
Wha... What?
Stop it!
Sanja!
Your thingies here are as cute as a baby's.
Stop! Stop it!
Help me, Fake Summer!
That's far enough.
I have lost my memory, however...
I have lived for 1,500 years.
I am the greatest and most real magician alive.
I gather together the threads of the story with the spirits to guide me.
My name...
What?
Are you here again?
You, who call yourself Mori Summer.
I propose that we settle who the real Mori Summer is here and now.
What are you talking about?
We have already discussed this.
If that is so, use your love to purify me and obliterate me
for now and all eternity.
We will have a wizard's duel on the horizon of permanence.
Take flight, elves! Whisper to me, soul spirits!
Spiritual Caricature!
Get her, Nibutani!
I know.
I've taken it too far to get embarrassed now.
What is the meaning of this? Do you want Sanja that badly?
Get real.
I can't stand the idea of you using the name of Mori Summer, that's all!
I am the true one. Come to me, soul spirits!
Fairy spirits, lend me your strength!
Nothing embarrasses me more than my dark history...
Fake Summer.
I will not allow her to be used by a creep like you
for your own despicable ends!
She was my own twisted love...
I aimed at myself!
Yes!
Critical hit.
Got that? Good. Now get lost.
What was that attack supposed to be?
Is that your so-called power as Mori Summer?
Sorry to disappoint you, but I have exhaustively
studied the entire content of the Mabinogion.
I am the greater incarnation of Mori Summer.
The girl is mine.
She is my angel I fought so hard to find.
I have been following her ever since I first saw her in the city.
I waited so long to approach her.
You will never have her!
Mori Summer!
Nibutani!
Apparently I have the greater power of imagination, Miss Faker.
It's time for you to disappear for good this time.
Begone!
You're tough. Just let go.
I should mention that even if you do get what you want...
What?!
She's the worst. She never does as she's told.
She has no intention of respecting her elders.
She's spoiled, and violent, and annoying.
But she gets lonely, and she can be such a coward, and she's a crybaby.
And she makes these really cute smiles when you least expect it.
Fake Summer.
She's no angel. She's more trouble than any devil.
She's the best idiot ever.
Did you call her an idiot?
Do not defile my Sanja!
Nibutani!
Mjolnir Hammer!
Sanja, why?
She is definitely the imposter. She is Fake Summer, however...
She is a genuine imposter, fair and square! Unlike you!
What?
You are not Mori Summer either!
The real Mistress Mori Summer would never do this!
What?
You are a wolf in sheep's clothing!
I, Dekomori, will vanquish you, Fake Summer!
Ultimate End Of The Great Hammer...
I loved you from the moment I saw you.
I thought you were angelic.
I wanted to make you look my way.
That's all.
What's so great about someone like her?
Someone like her? Sanja is an angel.
A pure and innocent angel. She has never loved or been with a man.
She has never held hands, never mind kissed anyone.
She actually has had her first kiss.
What?
On Christmas.
Th-that wasn't...
You're kidding. But I...
But I thought she was the one.
Victory!
You had no part in it.
I'm so glad they seem to be back to normal.
By the way, that kiss was an accident.
That goes without saying! Why are you blushing?!
I am not blushing! You're the one turning red.
I am not!
TO BE CONTINUED
You are so unlovable!
