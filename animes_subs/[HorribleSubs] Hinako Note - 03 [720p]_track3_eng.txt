It's finally time to start school...
The first day is so exciting, isn't it?
Exciting, huh?
You seem more nervous than excited, Hina-chan.
Yeah. I wonder if I'll make friends,
and if I'll be able to get along with my classmates...
Thinking about it all makes me so nervous.
You're right. That is nerve-wracking.
You're going to be standing on the stage with the theater troupe soon.
Think of this as another type of training.
You're right.
For starters, if I can get over freezing up whenever I'm in front of people...
You'll be fine!
Just look! You're talking to us right now, aren't you?
Yeah... I am!
I'm starting to feel like I can do this!
S-S-S-Sa... Saku...
S-Sakuragi... H-H-Hinako...
I-I'm from the... c-country...
You can do it, Hina-chan!
I'm Hinako!
Mistaken Friend
Fujimiya Girls' High
I couldn't do it.
N-No, that was a very unique self-introduction.
Unique?
Hinako-chan.
I can call you that, right?
So you lived in the country?
U-Um... I... uh...
Th-The... c-country...
Um...
That's right!
I lived in the mountains and worked as a scarecrow!
Ventriloquism?
That's a funny way to communicate!
They laughed.
So what did you do as a scarecrow?
Oh, yeah! I'm curious, too!
Well, you see...
Chiaki-chan!
Look at this.
Theater Society
Recruiting Members
What's this about?
Well, you see, all the fans of Chiaki-chan, the theater club ace,
put this together over spring break!
You know, since the club went on hiatus,
we don't get to see you on stage, right?
Right...
That makes your fans really sad.
And you seemed really disappointed when it went on hiatus, too.
So we thought, if we started a theater society, you could act again!
Huh? Chiaki-chan?
That ventriloquism talk went over better than I thought.
Yeah. I wasn't able to say a word, though.
Hina-chan! Kuu-chan!
Miss Landlady!
What's up?
Well, there's something I wanted to show you.
Here.
Theater society... recruiting members?
Miss Landlady, what's this about a society?
My friends put it together to replace the theater club while it's on hiatus.
So that means we'll be able to do theater here at this school?
That's right.
So about that...
What do you two want to do?
Of course, I'll join!
I'm with Hina-chan!
Okay, could you come to the theater club room later?
It's just a society now, but you'll still need to apply.
Got it!
This is great, Hina-chan!
Yeah!
Hey, you there!
Are you friends with Chiaki-senpai?
Huh?
You were talking to her like you are!
Why? What's going on between you?
Eh... ah... i-it...
Um, I'm sorry, but who might you be?
I just introduced myself earlier!
I'm your classmate, Nakajima Yua!
I want to be an actress, and I enrolled in this school because of Chiaki-senpai's acting!
Oh, really?
Yes, really!
So...
How can a little shrimp like you be friends with Chiaki-senpai?
S-Sorry! I might have gone too far!
I guess she's a nice person deep down...
But I still want to know what the deal is!
Argh!
I don't get her at all.
Um, Nakajima-san?
What?!
Hina-chan and I have somewhere we need to go,
so we'll be going now.
Huh? Hey!
Theater Club
M-Miss Landlady!
What happened?
We ran into someone pretty powerful.
I see. There, there.
I need to talk to you!
Well? Are you really planning to join the club?
Eh... um... Y-Yes...
I'll never approve of you joining!
Wh-Why not?
Why not?!
A failure of a little shrimp like you...
Jeez, that's hard to say.
Yes! A failshrimp like you isn't fit to be in this theater club with Chiaki-senpai!
U-Um...
In fact, you're not fit for Chiaki-senpai!
Do you even have the guts to stand on a stage?
Um...
Are we interrupting something?
U-Uh...
Um, um... well... I mean...
No. Nothing.
I see. So, um, are you hoping to join the club?
Y-Yes!
What's your name?
Nakajima Yua.
Yua-chan? That's a nice name.
Let's do our best together.
Th-Th...
Thank you for having me!
Well, I'll be going now!
Huh? Did I do something to her?
At any rate, you saved Hina-chan.
Huh?
You make such delicious coffee, Mayu-chan.
Thanks.
By the way, I heard you two joined the theater club?
Yeah!
It's just a society now, though.
But it's the theater club at its core, right?
Yeah. All the club members are joining, too.
In any case, Hina-chan's goal of being in theater at Fujimiya High has come true.
Yeah!
Wait... But we've only just formed our theater troupe.
Was it okay for us to join the theater club?
Why don't you just do both?
We can do both?
Sounds like you'll be busy.
That's true.
There's another hurdle Hina-chan needs to get over first, after all.
Hurdle?
I mean getting used to being in front of people!
I-In front of people...
Then how about working part-time in the coffee shop?
That sounds good. It's a service industry, after all.
Okay, it's settled!
Hina-chan, try working here on your next day off from school.
Ah... u-um...
Don't worry! Leave everything to me!
U-Um...
Okay.
I let Mayu-chan talk me into agreeing, but...
Let's see...
Theater troupe, theater club, serving customers part-time...
How am I gonna do this?!
But as long as I don't get nervous, things seem to work out okay...
I guess all I can do is try my best.
Fujimiya Girls' High
I may be mistaken, but that's what I think.
At any rate, the bear's gall of Nametoko Mountain is well-known.
Okay, the next passage...
Sakuragi-san.
Y-Yes!
I-It cures s-stomachaches and m-makes wounds disappear.
A-At the N-N-Namari-no-Yu entrance...
Sensei!
I'll read it for her.
Uh...
O-Okay, go ahead, then.
Sakuragi-san, you can sit down.
O-Okay...
It cures stomachaches and makes wounds disappear.
At the Namari-no-Yu entrance,
a sign has long stood that reads,'Bear's gall here.'
Isn't she... that scary girl?
Oh, darn...
Uh... Sakuragi-san.
Y-Yes?
Can you help me carry the handouts on the desk here?
U-U-U-Uh...
I'll carry them!
Hmph!
Okay... Sakuragi-san.
Y-Yes! Um...
I'll answer it!
Sakuragi-san.
Y-Yes!
Let me handle it!
Sakuragi-san.
Y-Ye
I'll go!
Sakuragi-san.
I'll answer it!
Sakuragi-san.
I'll take it!
Sakuragi-san.
I'll do it for her!
Sakuragi-san.
Let me handle it!
Sakuragi-san.
I'll do that!
Sakuragi-san.
I'll carry it!
Sakuragi-san.
I'll do it for her!
I'll do that!
Hina-chan!
Y-Yes?
Let's head home.
Okay.
What should we eat on the way home today?
We're having dinner as soon as we get home.
Eating books to hold myself over is kinda...
The desserts there are the best!
Really?
Hmm... Oh!
Wait here a second, okay?
Excuse me! I'd like one of these and one of these.
Um...
Excuse me, but which way is the station?
U-Um... I... uh...
I'll show you the way!
Please, come with me.
Thank you so much.
You need to get to the station, right?
Just turn left at that traffic signal there,
then go straight, and you'll see it right away.
Oh, thank you. You've been such a big help.
This'll show everyone that I can do what that little failure can't!
How was that? Do you see what a failshrimp you are now?
The one fit for Chiaki-senpai is me, Nakajima Yu
Did I take that too far?
No!
Don't think that way, Yua! You must harden your heart!
Look nowhere but forward!
She's so nice...
She always covers for me when I fall short.
Maybe we can be friends...
Here you go.
Oh... uh...
Actually putting on that uniform might be kind of embarrassing...
You need guts, too!
Guts?
Could I work at the used bookstore, maybe?
The bookstore is closed today.
Oh... So that's why she's been nodding off all morning.
Strawberry parfait...
Don't worry! I'll support you all the way! Okay?
O-Okay...
Th-Then... I'll be counting on you.
Trust me!
Good luck. With everything.
Hina-chan, you look so cute!
R-Really?
It looks great on you! It does!
Okay, next is this!
N-Next?
This looks great, too!
M-Mayu-chan, is this really a uniform?
It is, meow!
Meow?
You try it, too.
Meow, meow!
M-Meow, meow?
Squee! You're too cute!
Hina-chan, let's move right on to the next one!
I can't eat any more...
Huh?!
Changing outfits on a doll...
Oops, I dozed off.
Oh, Kuu-chan! You're awake now?
I think I'm still dreaming.
I guess clean and pure really is best.
Well, ready to get started now?
I've never done any work other than being a scarecrow...
Oh, Mayu-chan, do you have any tips for serving customers?
Eh?
Hmm... well...
There's greeting them properly, speaking loudly,
and everything else can be solved with a smile.
She's so cute!
We hardly get any customers, anyway...
Huh?
I know Mayu-chan said that,
but what if we do get customers?
Just thinking about serving customers makes me nervous...
You're right! I can't lose my confidence!
Thanks. Sorry I worried you. I'm okay now.
U-Um...
You can talk to birds?
Can that bird talk?
N-No... um...
She's got her hopes up...
Hi there! I'm Toritarou, tweet!
What brings you here by yourself? Are you on a walk?
No. I got lost and can't find my way home.
What? That's awful!
Oh!
Th-That's awful! Um... um...
Do you know your home phone number?
Uh huh.
Then call your family with this.
I'm sure they'll come for you, tweet.
I feel a little guilty somehow...
Oh, hello? Mommy? I'm at... um...
Coffee Shop Hitotose.
I'm at a place called Coffee Shop Hitotose.
Uh huh. I'm with a girl in a really fancy costume!
Oh, welco
Huh?
Um, she seems to be lost.
Oh, dear!
Oh, but we've already called her mom,
and she's coming for her.
Really? That's good, then.
Make yourself at home, okay?
Okay!
Hina-chan, you did great!
You were able to talk to her, right?
Oh, I didn't do anything.
It was all Toritarou.
Toritarou? Who is that?
Thanks, Toritarou and the lady!
See you later!
Really, thank you so much.
Y-Y-Y-Y...
You're wellfrm!
We'll be going, then.
Bye!
There, there.
What a tiring day.
I wasn't able to talk to a single customer the whole time.
I'll completely fail both the theater troupe and the theater club at this rate.
I really am a failshrimp.
I know! I'll try my hardest to talk to that girl!
I can't move forward if I keep talking about failing.
Okay! Time to take a step forward!
Fujimiya Girls' High
Good morning!
Okay, you go on ahead.
Okay.
Oh, Nakajima-san?
Wh-Where'd you come from?!
U-Um... uh...
So you're actually here!
I thought you'd be bawling after learning that I'm the one fit for Chiaki-senpai,
and maybe you wouldn't come to school anymore.
Actually, I was wondering what I'd do if you didn't come.
You've got some guts!
Huh? The landlady? Um, what do you mean?
What do I mean?! You realize that you're a failshrimp, right?
After all those times I covered for you!
Oh, yeah!
Thanks for helping me out so much.
It made me really happy.
Huh?
So, there's actually something I've been wanting to say to you...
Wh-What?
I'd like to be...
F-Friends?
A-Are you sure you're not mistaken?
Huh?
I wasn't trying to help you or...
Oh, Sakuragi-san, could you...
I'll take them!
Uh...
You helped me again!
I-I did not! That was a conditioned reflex, or something...
Thanks!
I think we'll be really good friends!
Hmph. Let's just get going.
Hey, Nakajima-san...
Can I call you Yua-chan from now on?
Do what you want.
Thanks, Yua-chan!
Hmph!
The Scarecrow Heroine
I'm so glad Hina-chan seems to have made a friend!
And the theater society's activities have begun, too.
It sounds like Hina-chan is practicing lots of things every day.
Next time: The Scarecrow Heroine.
